<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right &#8212; your Valentines are finally* in! (Love has no season, why&#8217;s there gotta be a separate <em>day </em>for it, grumblegrumpexcuse.) Thanks for the response! We have three entries, and befitting the broad nature of modern-day IF, they are all in different forms: one in Twine, one in Inform, and one in text. They are below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6qp92977388y72d/Ode%20to%20Daniel%20Stelzer.gblorb?dl=0"><strong>TO: </strong>Daniel Stelzer; <strong>FROM: </strong>Hanon Ondricek!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bfwb70k354y0pqw/A%20Twine%20Thingamabob%20about%20an%20Inform%20Programmer.html?dl=0"><strong>TO: </strong>Melvin Rangasamy; <strong>FROM: </strong>Andrew Schulz!</a></li>
<li><b>TO: </b>Graham Nelson; <strong>FROM: </strong>Rowan Lipkovits:</li>
</ul>
<p>Valentines are hosted via Dropbox, except [one] which is in sonnet form, and below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bravo to the scribes of Inform 7:<br />
like Prometheus&#8217; theft of fire,<br />
such a gift could be sent down from heaven &#8212;<br />
advent crowed by troubadour and crier.</p>
<p>Thinking thoughts out loud is all one&#8217;s needing<br />
to create a universe uniquely<br />
yours &#8212; and all your furtive fruitful seeding<br />
blooms in others&#8217; gamboling obliquely.</p>
<p>Now must I kowtow upon the floor.  You<br />
gave us all the tools for work and playing<br />
freely and without a catch, therefore: to<br />
Mister Nelson&#8217;s crew, here&#8217;s much hooraying!</p>
<p>For a gift, you see, that keeps on giving;<br />
text adventures&#8217; triage back to living.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks everyone! We hope to see you again next Valentine&#8217;s Day, with even more author and developer love.</p>
