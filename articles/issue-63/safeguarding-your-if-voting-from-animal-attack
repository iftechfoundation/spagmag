<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Last year, sci-fi fans were <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/04/08/_2015_hugo_awards_how_the_sad_and_rabid_puppies_took_over_the_sci_fi_nominations.html" target="_blank">appalled to discover</a> that the nominations for the 2015 Hugo Awards were dominated by a small </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">but disgruntled and well-organized minority of the voters called the Puppies, </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">who publicized a slate of candidates and voted mostly in lockstep.</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Almost all the Hugo nominees are unread by me, but the consensus was that the Puppies&#8217; picks were motivated by racial and gender bias (at least in the case of the larger of the two Puppy factions, the Rabid Puppies) as well as a </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">preference</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> for the old-fashioned where plots are concerned. Some important categories didn&#8217;t have a single nominee that wasn&#8217;t drawn from the Puppy slates, leaving </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">many</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> voters with nothing to mark on their ballots but “No Award.” The sci-fi community quickly <a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/hugo-awards-suborned-what-can-or-should-be-done" target="_blank">began debating voting reforms</a> to stop the Puppies from repeating their victory in 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Does the IF community have anything to learn from the sci-fi fans&#8217; electoral strategizing? Are IF awards like the IF Comp and the XYZZY at risk of a similar raid by canines, alligators, or their evolutionary descendants?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In one sense the IF awards look even more vulnerable than the Hugos. The WorldCon organization requires voters to pay</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/i-want-to-vote/" target="_blank">at least a $40 “supporting membership” fee</a> to </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">submit a Hugo ballot</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, but voting for the </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Comp and XYZZY</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> awards </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">has been</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">free </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">to anyone in the world who</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8216;</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">s willing to register on a website. That means it would be easier to coordinate a bloc of voters who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t vote at all. For the most part, open-voting IF awards&#8217; obscurity has kept them secure. But history has shown that on the Internet, an angry mob can materialize overnight, and an IF game isn&#8217;t necessarily too small a target to attract trolls&#8217; fury. And IF awards have few enough voters that even a small effort may prove statistically significant.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">T</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he XYZZYs </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">have a </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">somewhat</span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> vaguely-defined rule against </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">voting blocs. Traditionally, entrants are given this guidance: “canvasing for votes is strongly discouraged, either for your own game or on behalf of others. It’s fine to talk about the XYZZYs – but if doing so results in a flood of voters all voting for the same game, those votes will be discounted.” For the 2011 XYZZY awards, Choice of Games <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/2012/03/we-almost-flooded-the-xyzzy-ballot-box/" target="_blank">reported that they effectively overwhelmed the voting</a> with a single blog post encouraging their fans to vote for an eligible ChoiceScript game that year. (In a further affront to certain segments of the traditional IF community, the game that received the flood of vo</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">tes <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/zombie-exodus/" target="_blank">was about zombies</a>.) That year the XYZZY organizers threw out every ballot that didn&#8217;t vote for at least one game not written in ChoiceScript, and another game was crowned the winner. (To their credit, 2012&#8217;s post was scrupulous to avoid even the slightest inkling of a repeat.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The IF Comp&#8217;s corresponding rule on bad-faith voting, adopted before the 2014 Comp, says that every judge who rates a game should make</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> “a good-faith effort to actually play that game as intended” and the organizers “reserve the right to disqualify any ratings that appear to have been submitted under any other lcircumstances.” </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">there&#8217;s no guarantee that there&#8217;ll always be a way to distinguish bloc voters&#8217; ballots from everybody else&#8217;s, or any way to reconstruct what the result of an election would have been if </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">an undesired</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> “flood” of voters hadn&#8217;t happened. (This makes everything murky; last year&#8217;s comp saw rumblings of the fact, or perhaps coincidence, that every Twine game in the 2015 comp, without exception, <a href="http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=19212">received two 1/10 votes</a>.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I wish to apply a very, very light touch to this sort of negative enforcement,” IF Comp organizer Jason McIntosh wrote. “One of the best aspects of the IFComp is the annual array of very thoughtful reviews that all sorts of people write and publish. Some of these have, in recent years, begun to appear in high-profile commercial media. I would certainly not wish to conflate audience enthusiasm — resulting, I hope, in </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">audience growth — with Sad/Rabid Puppies-style, bad-faith bloc voting!”</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">There is a</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"> limited </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">release of post-Comp </span><a href="http://www.ifcomp.org/comp/2014" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">voting stats</span></a> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">that allow fans to speculate about whether there was any unfair pattern in the ballots.</span> McIntosh also pointed to the longstanding requirement for judges to rate at least five games as an important safeguard against “thoughtless &#8216;drive-by&#8217; votes, or even well-intentioned votes where a person read a high-profile glowing review of a game, played it, and then did nothing else — which might prove imbalancing to the comp overall.”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">One unique feature of the XYZZYs seems to give them an advantage over the Hugos in diluting voting slates: the XYZZY website lets each voter nominate only a single work per category in the nominating round. That means it wouldn&#8217;t be possible for a bunch of prospective ballot-stuffers to copy-paste a slate of games from a blog and turn that same slate into the entire second round list of nominees. It would at least demand a certain minimum amount of logistical effort for the bloc voters to coordinate their votes to make sure each entry on their slate scored over the threshold.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A proposal that&#8217;s been thrown around for Hugo voting is to <a href="http://djangowexler.com/2015/04/05/the-hugo-awards-game-theory-and-a-modest-proposal/" target="_blank">allow a limited number of anti-votes in the nominating round</a>. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">T</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he IF Comp essentially has anti-votes </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">already,</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> because you can assign games you don&#8217;t like a “1.” For the XYZZYs (like the Hugos), there&#8217;s such a long tail of eligible but unworthy works each year that it wouldn&#8217;t be feasible to anti-vote for all of them. So, the only value in allowing anti-votes would be as failsafe against voting slates: when you hear that some person you don&#8217;t like has created a slate, you anti-vote for everything on it. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the downside</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, anti-votes would create a new weapon for </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">trolls to wage</span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">personal vendettas and target quality works for political reasons, and the XYZZYs would have to join the Comp in awarding an annual Golden Banana of Discord.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A more interesting alternative was <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-should-the-Hugo-Award-nominees-be-decided" target="_blank">proposed in a discussion about the Hugos on Quora</a>. The idea was to use “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting" target="_blank">reweighted approval voting</a></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">” in the nominating round, which would mean that after the candidate with the most nominating votes was placed on the nominee list, an elector who voted for that candidate would get only half a vote for deciding the second entry on the nominee list. If the elector voted for both of the first two candidates who made in on the nominee list, then the elector would get only a quarter of a vote for deciding the third nominee, and so on. Reweighted approval voting </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">has the benefit of diluting coordinated voting blocs, but it also encourages tactical voting. If you&#8217;re confident your preferred candidate is the front-runner, you have a disincentive to vote for that candidate, because by doing so you dilute the votes that you could have used to decide who became the second nominee, </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">the third,</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and so on.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Then there was the <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016206.html" target="_blank">long discussion on Making Light</a> that <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016262.html" target="_blank">ended with another proposal</a> inspired by the idea of diluting ballots that have votes for more than one front-runner. It uses a </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">“single divisible vote with least popular elimination”</span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">system that </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">asks</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">good-faith voters to </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">divide up their vote among</span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">(ideally long) </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">lists of potential nominees, and then whittl</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">es</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> away </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">the list of finalists by removing the least popular ones first and reassigning their share of the vote to the other candidates that shared the same ballot</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">s</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> with them. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In theory, t</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he good-faith electors&#8217; voting power will end up concentrated behind only the most popular entries on their longlists, </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">while </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">t</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he bloc&#8217;s voting power </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">will </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">remain diluted </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">if</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> all the entries on their voting slate are about equally popular. </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, t</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">he good-faith voters </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">may face a dilemma because if they </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">nominate too many works, they&#8217;ll have no way to express a preference between them, </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">and</span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> works with broad but lukewarm support might become the finalists.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">The voting systems described above are all intended to ensure that a minority bloc doesn&#8217;t thwart the will of the majority. But the reality is that a majority voting bloc could be just as harmful to the integrity of an IF award, if it was the result of a raid on the polls from outside the community. </span><span style="color: #000000;">The only real way to prevent that </span><span style="color: #000000;">would be</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to limit who gets to vote. </span><span style="color: #000000;">A time-tested way to keep out undesirables is to use Academy-style voting like the Oscars, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Emmys, and Grammys, </span><span style="color: #000000;">or a critics&#8217; award like the Golden Globes</span><span style="color: #000000;">. But it&#8217;s not easy to keep track of the membership of an academy, especially when the award organization is a few volunteers working for free. An IF academy would present particular problems because there&#8217;s </span><span style="color: #000000;">no clear definition of</span><span style="color: #000000;">which works count as “IF,” and it&#8217;s almost certain that technological changes are going to </span><span style="color: #000000;">expand</span><span style="color: #000000;"> the world of IF in unexpected directions. </span><span style="color: #000000;">The enthusiastic ChoiceScript supporters were seen as invaders by the IF community in the 2011 XYZZYs, but with <em>Creatures Such as We</em> taking second place in the 2014 Comp and <em>Scarlet Sails </em>taking 7th in 2015, they probably wouldn&#8217;t be considered such outsiders today.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Without knowing which works are IF, it&#8217;s hard to say who</span><span style="color: #000000;">&#8216;</span><span style="color: #000000;">s a part of the IF community, and still harder to form an </span><span style="color: #000000;">electorate</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that includes all of those people while keeping others out. </span><span style="color: #000000;">No electoral system can be perfect, </span><span style="color: #000000;">and the more disagreement there is about whose interests the system should serve, the more challenging it&#8217;ll be to craft rules that make the outcome feel legitimate to everybody.</span></span></span></p>
