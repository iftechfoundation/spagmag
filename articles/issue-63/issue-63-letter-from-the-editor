<p>Hello! At long last, Issue 63 of SPAG is upon us, at quite a prolific time IF events-wise &#8212; the XYZZY Awards just opened first-round voting, and a new crop of quite good IF works are available via Spring Thing. We&#8217;ve been at this IF thing for over a decade; we&#8217;ve come a long way from a spate of IF content in October then nothing. May it continue to flourish.</p>
<p>First, a little disclaimer about this issue. As many of you know, I was an entrant in 2015&#8217;s comp with <em><a href="http://katherinestasaph.itch.io/synfac">Laid Off from the Synesthesia Factory</a>. </em>2015&#8217;s comp also saw an unusual amount of inter-author discussion and collaboration, and I&#8217;ve since come to consider many of my fellow entrants friends. Therefore, I&#8217;ve made the difficult decision that it would be a conflict of interest for SPAG to review the comp, as has been traditional in previous years. (To my knowledge, this situation has not previously come up for several years, if not a decade.)</p>
<p><strong>That said! </strong><a href="http://springthing.net/2016/">Spring Thing 2016 is now upon us</a>, and CoI-free! Therefore, I&#8217;m soliciting <strong>reviews of Spring Thing entries<em>, </em></strong>Back Garden and otherwise; as always, extra points for succinct and/or diversionary takes.</p>
<p>As always, I&#8217;m soliciting pitches as well! There&#8217;s no formal theme this time around, but always welcome are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPAG Specifics </strong>on stories of your choice. This issue features a <a href="/issue-63/spag-specifics-paolo-chikiamcos-slammed/">Specifics entry on </a><a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/slammed/"><em>Slammed! </em></a>by Paolo Chikiamco and Choice Of Games, but be more  (Issue 64, for instance, will feature an entry on interactive film.) (To be clear, this includes IFcomp entries. Except maybe mine. Unless you really want to.)</li>
<li><strong>Interviews and/or reviews </strong>of figures in the IF world and/or adjacent to it. I define this broadly; if you&#8217;re wondering whether someone counts, it can&#8217;t hurt to get in touch!</li>
<li><strong>Live coverage</strong>, if you live in an area with a significant live interactive fiction presence. This can range from exhibits, to conference coverage, to performances.</li>
<li><strong>Essays </strong>of any kind. The more unexpected, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Basically anything you can think of </strong>will be considered!</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I welcome pitches by and about women, people of color, LGBT and otherwise underrepresented writers.</p>
<p>Send pitches to <strong>spag.mag.if@gmail.com</strong>. There&#8217;s no deadline, but I&#8217;d love to hear from you! ETA for Issue 64 is late summer to fall.</p>
<p>In addition, SPAG is also <strong>seeking an artist! </strong>This primarily entails cover art &#8212; you can see past examples in back issues &#8212; but if you have something else in mind, I&#8217;d love to hear from you about this as well.</p>
<p>(Payment for all of the above can be negotiated.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading as always! I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>
