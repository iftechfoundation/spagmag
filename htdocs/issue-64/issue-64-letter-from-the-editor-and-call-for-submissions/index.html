<h2>Issue 64:
Letter from the Editor and Call for Submissions</h2>


<h3>August 9, 2016</h3>



<p>The IF world, like most artistic fields, is seasonal, and as in music and (to an extent) film, August is a slower month, full of what David Rakoff called &#8220;<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/569519-hanging-out-does-not-make-one-an-artist-a-secondhand">the opposite of hanging out</a>.&#8221; If fall and spring are full of new content, awards and the occasional conference or two, late summer is that in-between&#xA0;season, one that looks languid on the surface but conceals a lot of hard work. Dozens of authors, as you read this, are&#xA0;preparing competition entries for the September deadline, or solidifying commercial pitches, or &#8212; for those&#xA0;<em>really </em>ahead of schedule&#xA0;&#8212; getting their work playtested.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re taking a lot of breaks from being hard at work for such edifying pursuits as playing Minesweeper ripoffs and looking at online auctions for swing coats.&#xA0;But if you&#8217;re&#xA0;<em>not&#xA0;</em>like me, you&#8217;re using that time to read Issue 64 of SPAG &#8212;&#xA0;one I&#8217;m especially proud of!</p>
<p>For Issue 64, we&#8217;re taking an especially broad view of interactive fiction&#xA0;and its connections, both obvious and not, to other fields. This issue&#xA0;features the dubious, beyond-spotty history of interactive film, the evolution of storytelling in hidden-object games, and the applications of parser games to artificial intelligence research.&#xA0;Of course, we&#8217;ve got plenty of more traditional coverage as well, including a Specifics entry on&#xA0;Caelyn Sandel&#8217;s episodic piece&#xA0;<em>Bloom&#xA0;</em>and an interview with Brendan Patrick Hennessy, whose&#xA0;<em>Birdland&#xA0;</em>flew away with an entire gaggle of XYZZY Awards, as well as other, less forcedly metaphorical praise.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;re done reading, perhaps you&#8217;d like to contribute to our next issue? Issue 65, like this one, has no formal theme (as we&#8217;ve seen, these things tend to come together organically), but as always, welcome are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPAG Specifics&#xA0;</strong>on stories of your choice. These are less traditional reviews and more in-depth&#xA0;critical&#xA0;pieces on how a particular piece does what it does.</li>
<li><strong>Interviews and/or reviews&#xA0;</strong>of figures in the IF world and/or adjacent to it, defined broadly.</li>
<li><strong>Live coverage</strong>, if you live in an area with a significant live interactive fiction presence. This can range from exhibitions to conference coverage to performances to whatever the world&#xA0;dreams up. (Free pitch idea: if you&#8217;re a&#xA0;reader in the Toronto area attending the <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/initiatives/">2016 Wordplay Festival</a>&#xA0;in early November who is not me, I&#8217;d like to hear from you.)</li>
<li><strong>Essays&#xA0;</strong>of any kind. The more unexpected, the better.</li>
<li><strong>Basically anything you can think of&#xA0;</strong>related to interactive fiction&#xA0;will be considered!</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, I welcome pitches by and about women, people of color, LGBT and otherwise underrepresented writers. Also:&#xA0;<strong>there is payment</strong> commensurate with standard online writing rates.</p>
<p>Send pitches to&#xA0;<strong>spag.mag.if@gmail.com</strong>. There&#8217;s no deadline, but I&#8217;d love to hear from you! In keeping with our rough quarterly schedule, Issue 65 will likely arrive around late fall or winter. (What this means for you: anything related to 2016&#8217;s competition entries is probably best suited to #66.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading as ever! We hope you enjoy this issue, and send us the makings of another great one.</p>
