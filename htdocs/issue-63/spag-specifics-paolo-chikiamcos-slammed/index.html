<h2>Issue 63:
SPAG Specifics: Paulo Chikiamco&#x2019;s <i>Slammed!</i></h2>


<h3>By Hugo Labrande &#x2014; April 11, 2016</h3>



<p>I am a really, really big wrestling fan. When&#xA0;I was 3 I loved the Bushwhackers&#xA0;(&#8230; yeah) and the Undertaker; I rediscovered wrestling 15 years later (still love the Undertaker) and&#xA0;was hooked for a long time. It&#8217;ll come to no surprise to you, then, that I think <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/slammed/"><em>Slammed!</em> </a>is a&#xA0;really good game &#x2013; but even if you don&#8217;t like wrestling or think it&#8217;s stupid, you&#xA0;should give it a shot: it is long, exciting and well-written.</p>
<p>In <em>Slammed!</em>, you play as a wrestler, learning the ropes at an independent federation and&#xA0;hoping to be noticed by the big federation, where a former friend is having some success.&#xA0;There are about four main love interests, two of whom&#xA0;are obvious and the others less so. All these&#xA0;are nicely integrated with the story, which is&#xA0;laudable.&#xA0;The game branches at the end, where you have&#xA0;three potential outcomes; my first playthrough took me about four hours, which is long for CoG.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <em>Slammed! </em>is&#xA0;mostly linear, with lots of immovable&#xA0;parts; the plot is exciting, but even the bad events are largely unavoidable,&#xA0;and what&#xA0;choices and stat changes exist&#xA0;are used to&#xA0;color your playthrough or reach optional side-quests or&#xA0;achievements. One coup, though,&#xA0;is&#xA0;how the game&#xA0;brings narrative tension to&#xA0;matches. After all, wrestling is &#8220;fake,&#8221; in the sense that the outcomes are&#xA0;predetermined&#xA0;and&#xA0;also the matches themselves to different degrees. If the game replicated this, the only choice you&#8217;d have in the ring is whether you&#xA0;deviate from the script, which would be boring (and would get you fired). To get around this, the game uses the concept of &#8220;shoot wrestling&#8221;, which is <a href="http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Shoot_style">a real&#xA0;wrestling phenomenon</a>:&#xA0;the matches become&#xA0;more like fights, albeit ones that still use wrestling moves and ensure nobody gets hurt too much. This makes fight scenes actually unpredictable &#8212; there are twists you don&#8217;t see coming &#8212; adds tension and suspense, and makes you&#xA0;able to lose.</p>
<p>All the&#xA0;scenes of <em>Slammed&#xA0;</em>are short, and all the moments feel exciting.&#xA0;There&#8217;s also a nice variety of&#xA0;normal scenes, flashbacks within interviews (with <a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/a-bestiary-of-player-agency/">reflective choice points</a> that build&#xA0;your character); but you also have blog posts from a&#xA0;blogger (Internet fans are a huge&#xA0;force in today&#8217;s wrestling, and the tone is well-emulated) and scenes&#xA0;described via the show&#8217;s &#8220;screenplay&#8221;,&#xA0;which both make the moment feel big (&#8220;the masked man stares down from the top of the steel cage&#8221;) and are&#xA0;nice thematically (wrestling is acting, and&#xA0;you get the perspective of&#xA0;the audience).&#xA0;<em>Slammed&#xA0;</em>is even complete with a&#xA0;promo video that hypes your final match, which is epic and&#xA0;feels exactly like WWE promo videos.&#xA0;In fact,, everything in the game feels exactly like wrestling. The writing does a good&#xA0;job at introducing wrestling terminology, though&#xA0;it gets a bit carried away in the end, where terms like&#xA0;&#8220;<a href="http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Powerbomb">crucifix powerbomb</a>&#8221; are used without having been fully explained. But the&#xA0;worst that can happen is that you have a harder time visualizing the moves: you will not&#xA0;hopelessly drown in lingo in this game. There are a few throwaway references, like names or achievements (&#8220;bah gawd!&#8221;), or stuff that is mentioned in passing (&#8220;dangerous workplace&#xA0;behavior&#8221;); it&#8217;s not shoving it down your throat, but if you&#8217;re in the know, you&#8217;ll notice and&#xA0;smile. The in-ring names of the wrestlers all sound convincing, and some&#xA0;clearly&#xA0;riff off real-life wrestlers; the in-ring personas are very&#xA0;plausible (the Angels,&#xA0;the Lawmakers, Harley and Quinn), as well as the storylines in which they are involved,&#xA0;which (just like in wrestling) can be pretty ridiculous. The situations are inspired by real events (&#8220;sell like it&#8217;s 2005&#8221;)&#xA0;including references to&#xA0;reality TV, a road the WWE has been going down for the last few years. And nothing feels like a copy-and-paste job; rather, you the author creates an&#xA0;convincing alternate world that sometimes (like with the&#xA0;character of Madison Rio) I wished was real.</p>
<p>I have of course a few criticisms &#x2013; or rather, letdowns. First of all, the fact that the game is&#xA0;extremely linear means it is focused on a single perspective, which is that mainstream&#xA0;American wrestling (to be clearer, the WWE) is the best, and the ultimate goal is to be #1&#xA0;there. Now, the WWE might be the place to be for a lot of wrestlers &#x2013; and indeed, in the last couple years a lot of successful independent wrestlers have signed there. But&#xA0;this ignores the different cultures of wrestling, which constantly influence each&#xA0;other and enable&#xA0;wrestling to reinvent itself. For instance, there&#8217;s barely a mention of&#xA0;Japanese wrestling, which is just as excellent, and where lots of wrestlers (including&#xA0;famous North American ones) trained and had great careers before coming&#xA0;back to North America. Including branches that highlight those possibilities in the game&#xA0;might have made it richer, and made for&#xA0;a first half that is much less linear.</p>
<p>The other major letdown that I have is about how the game reacts when you play as a woman, as is Choice Of Games&#8217; house style.Playing as a female wrestler will give you the same opportunities and the same&#xA0;choices, except a particular one near the end, which doesn&#8217;t show up for male wrestlers. Otherwise, the only difference is the pronouns, and a misogynist character&#8217;s attitude towards you &#8212;&#xA0;that&#8217;s it. As&#xA0;a fun escapist game, a power fantasy, this is in a sense awesome &#x2013; it is just as easy to&#xA0;rise to the top of the company and kick the (male) champion&#8217;s ass as a woman. On the&#xA0;other hand, doing this feels like it&#8217;s dodging a major issue, which is that wrestling (and&#xA0;especially mainstream wrestling) has a terrible attitude towards women. Women in&#xA0;wrestling are largely used&#xA0;for titillation, as&#xA0;sex objects or objects for other men to fight over, sometimes hired purely on looks with&#xA0;minimal wrestling training, are given exploitative matches and characters that range from the cold bitch&#xA0;to the psycho, and contend with certain&#xA0;male wrestlers&#8217; attitudes on stage and backstage.&#xA0;There are a lot of great female wrestlers who are legitimately amazing (SHIMMER, Manami Toyota, Awesome&#xA0;Kong, Phoenix, Stratus, etc.), and they do get&#xA0;some amount of recognition &#8212; but nevertheless,&#xA0;there is a glass ceiling. So, when the worst&#xA0;thing that happens to you as a female wrestler is that one character, clearly written as an&#xA0;asshole, says women are weak or can&#8217;t count but he&#8217;ll still give you a chance, that&#8217;s a&#xA0;gross simplification. And when the game explains, in one paragraph, that &#8220;the company&#8217;s&#xA0;shows were misogynistic once, for two months, but they thought it was bad and they&#xA0;stopped&#8221;, when your game is otherwise so on-the-nose, you&#8217;re obviously refusing to&#xA0;engage with the problem.</p>
<p>It would be hard to try to talk about all that in the game &#x2013; or worse, to put all those&#xA0;obstacles on the female route and none on the male route (although that would for sure&#xA0;make for interesting commentary). But if you refuse to talk about it, you avoid some interesting questions. How do you become a female wrestler? How do you train? Who&#xA0;agrees to put you in their show? What&#8217;s your in-ring persona like? What storylines can you&#xA0;create? Do you only fight women? How do you break the glass ceiling in a system&#xA0;dominated by men determined to use you as eye candy? Do you get breast implants or do&#xA0;you insist they take you seriously because you sure can wrestle? Or both?&#xA0;Of course, this is more difficult to design, because the male and the female routes become quite&#xA0;different; and it involves dealing with social representations one might not have lived through. But what&#8217;s the alternative? I&#8217;m worried that it means that, ultimately, using the&#xA0;argument &#8220;you can play as whoever you want&#8221; when it doesn&#8217;t actually make any&#xA0;difference, feels either like a cheap pronoun-substitution trick or like escapism (&#8220;you can&#xA0;have the same privilege as straight white cis males! Maybe a few assholes won&#8217;t like you&#xA0;but you can still win as easily!&#8221;).&#xA0;It&#8217;s a tough call, and they went for what appears to be the safe option, which I&#xA0;think is a shame.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the game is quite transparently written&#xA0;as escapism &#8211; you become the biggest wrestler, you win it all, and the other problems don&#8217;t&#xA0;exist (and there are so many in wrestling: your body breaking down, painkiller addiction,&#xA0;alcoholism and other addictions to be able to cope, repeated concussions, loneliness and&#xA0;relationship rifts caused by being on the road 300 days a year, getting old and having to&#xA0;retire away from the spotlight, or being unable to do so, etc.). For other CoG games, it&#8217;s&#xA0;not a big deal; but for wrestling, where the problems are painfully apparent and have&#xA0;broken into the mainstream (Hogan steroids scandals, Benoit killings, Aronofsky&#8217;s <em>The&#xA0;Wrestler</em>, and even institutionalized racism and sexism), leaving them out completely didn&#8217;t&#xA0;really feel right to me.&#xA0;Nevertheless, <em>Slammed!</em>&#xA0;succeeds at its main goal, which is to be&#xA0;an awesome game about wrestling: the author is clearly very familiar with the&#xA0;wrestling world, and manages to reproduce&#xA0;this in a world and a story that feel true.</p>
