<h2>Issue 62:
Macdougal and Me at the Spring Thing Fair</h2>


<h3>By Christopher Huang &#x2014; May 4, 2015</h3>



			<p>Everyone loves a fair, and with the onset of Spring, the fair is where the village casts off its winter&#xA0;bundling, and steps out with ankles flashing, to see what the ripening year has to offer. Macdougal&#xA0;was no exception, though, being a fictional character and an urban one at that, he had never&#xA0;actually seen an annual Spring Thing. Rather, that made him all the more eager for the&#xA0;experience. And so, resplendent in togs that had not seen the light of day since the Autumn chill&#xA0;first set in, we made our way to the fair grounds.&#xA0;Where a carnival geek immediately splattered me with chicken blood.</p>
<p>Magdougal winced. &#8220;Ooh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;ll never wash out.&#8221;</p>
<h4>1. A Trial</h4>
<p>Art has but one purpose, and that is to touch the soul. While I don&#8217;t care much for Jackson&#xA0;Pollock, I will admit that there might be something in his chaotic splatter that might speak to&#xA0;someone&#8217;s soul: imagined shapes, suggestion of movement, explosion of colour.&#xA0;Perhaps the author of &#8220;A Trial&#8221; imagines himself to be the Jackson Pollock of the IF world. &#8220;A&#xA0;Trial&#8221; is something of a surreal mess. (Ah, but if you want the surreal, you ought to go with Dali&#xA0;or Magritte.) But IF is neither painting nor sculpture: those things are meant to be taken as a&#xA0;whole and contemplated at leisure. IF is more like music or literature &#8212; the &#8220;F&#8221; stands for&#xA0;&#8220;fiction&#8221;, after all &#8212; which involve a time component. They are experienced sequentially.&#xA0;And what can I say about &#8220;A Trial&#8221; in the light of this discussion? The experience was neither&#xA0;entertaining nor edifying. The tale, if there was one, lacked coherence. Lacking coherence, it kept&#xA0;me at a distance and thus failed to engage. (Also, the interminable faux&#xAD;bureaucratic nonsense&#xA0;forms were extremely tiresome.) Failing to engage with it, I found myself losing faith in it. And&#xA0;losing faith in it, I began to doubt its sincerity. That left me with nothing but nothing but nothing.</p>
<p>To the author: I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s all very clever, but please understand that you are not putting together a&#xA0;painting. I can&#8217;t step back from your collage to view it as a whole. Why are you doing this?</p>
<p>The carnival geek made no apologies, at least none that I could understand, but wandered off into&#xA0;the fairgrounds. &#8220;I&#8217;m fairly sure,&#8221; I said, a little crossly as I tried to clean away the blood, &#8220;that&#xA0;same fellow once threw a bowl of pancake batter at me. And here is one handkerchief that I will&#xA0;not be blowing my nose into today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are worse breakfasts than raw pancake batter. Besides, it&#8217;s a sort of performance art, isn&#8217;t&#xA0;it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me spend the whole of this article lecturing you, Macdougal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, chin up. It&#8217;s not so bad. Here, I got us something from the beer tent. Cheers!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever Macdougal had fetched from the beer tent, it was assuredly not beer. It burned its way&#xA0;down my throat like cheap whiskey and then settled warmly in the pit of my stomach like&#xA0;expensive brandy. &#8220;Macdougal!&#8221; I gasped, coughing, &#8220;what in heaven&#8217;s name is this?&#8221;&#xA0;Whatever Macdougal told me in reply was lost in the warm buzz singing in my ears. I understood&#xA0;none of it.</p>
<h4>2. Doggerland</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what this was. There were some screen effects, the purpose of which I am unclear,&#xA0;and a collage of imagery &#8230; but this was not &#8220;A Trial&#8221; by any means. This one actually held&#xA0;together for a positive experience.</p>
<p>I think that a good deal of it was in the promise of the premise. &#8220;Doggerland&#8221; did not pretend to be&#xA0;offering a journey or a quest: it was clear that I was being told a story. The story may have been a&#xA0;little obfuscated by the poetics, but it was there. It was a firm foundation that inspired trust. And&#xA0;while I am unsure about the supportive or narrative reasons for those poetic curlicues, I will admit&#xA0;that they add some aesthetic value. To be clear, I don&#8217;t mean that they add to the story itself, rather&#xA0;that they add to the experiencing of it. Like background music.</p>
<p>It was short, though; very short, and as far as I can tell there is but one significant choice to be&#xA0;made. But perhaps that is a good thing. Like alcohol, like that astounding raspberry&#xAD;flavoured&#xA0;dessert beer (which I maintain was more cordial than beer) I once had, like faux&#xAD;bureaucratic&#xA0;nonsense forms, some things are best enjoyed in small doses.</p>
<p>I had to decline the offer of a second glass: a single glass was pleasant, but it was early in the day&#xA0;and I could tell that any more of the heady stuff might make for an unpleasant experience.&#xA0;Besides, facing me right now was the fortune-&#xAD;teller&#8217;s tent.</p>
<p>I remembered the fortune&#xAD;-teller from fairs past: I remembered always coming away curious and&#xA0;puzzled and thinking, &#8220;next time, I shan&#8217;t be taken in.&#8221; Well, here was the next time, and I was&#xA0;determined to crack the mystery somehow. &#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; I said to Macdougal. I handed him my&#xA0;empty glass, then strode confidently into the darkened tent. Inside, I crossed the veiled lady&#8217;s palm&#xA0;with a silver sixpence, and waited to see what she had to tell me this time.</p>
<p>Incense blew across the table. I saw Tarot cards flutter and spin, and bangles made of bone slide&#xA0;noiselessly down elongated wrists. A hoarse voice whispered: &#8220;Make your own fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, what?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she was gone. So was the tent. Around me, the fair-&#xAD;goers milled about, unaware of my&#xA0;experience. And Macdougal was still nattering on about beer.</p>
<h4>3. Ruiness</h4>
<p>Porpentine has evolved, I think.&#xA0;&#8220;Ruiness&#8221; addresses the game aspect of interactive fiction more&#xA0;and better than anything I&#8217;ve seen thus far. I actually felt as though I were progressing by virtue of my own wits here, and that, I think, is what makes interactive fiction truly interactive:&#xA0;that sense of having accomplished your ending.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the usual fantastic imagery one has come to expect from Porpentine. It would&#xA0;not be Porpentine without that sense of having been transported into a half&#xAD;-understood alien world,&#xA0;with a rich (and decaying) culture all its own.&#xA0;I do feel, however, that the &#8220;fiction&#8221; aspect seems weaker than in those other games. It might be&#xA0;the price of that alien landscape: unfamiliar ideas are harder to grasp, and harder to convey in the&#xA0;smaller, bite-&#xAD;sized chunks of text required by more &#8220;game&#8221;-heavy IF.</p>
<p>Also,&#xA0;in spite of my sense of accomplishment, I have no idea what I&#xA0;accomplished. I don&#8217;t know if it was a bug in the game, some incompatibility with my particular&#xA0;hardware setup or if I was perhaps just missing something, but the ending for me was &#8230; rather&#xA0;abrupt and inexplicable. Or perhaps I haven&#8217;t yet accomplished the Best Possible Ending, which&#xA0;means I Must Play More.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Next time, I shan&#8217;t be taken in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8230;?&#8221; I stared at Macdougal. Had he really not witnessed the entire episode with the fortune-teller? But I was saved from having to explain it further when he suddenly turned his head, eyes&#xA0;shining, and trotted off towards a stand of oaks. I could hear the strains of music coming from that&#xA0;direction: no doubt that was what had caught my friend&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>When I caught up with Macdougal, he was staring with rapt attention at an attractive young&#xA0;musician: a woman in a cheongsam, black hair elaborately braided, a violin singing from her&#xA0;shoulder. She was, indeed, very beautiful, and she played beautifully: but after several minutes, I&#xA0;began to feel restless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s at least stay to the end of this piece,&#8221; Macdougal whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know this piece of music. It goes on forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She only knows three pieces by heart,&#8221; whispered another bystander. &#8220;But they&#8217;re each an hour&#xA0;long.&#8221;</p>
<h4>4. Sunrise</h4>
<p>&#8220;Sunrise&#8221; is gorgeously presented. There&#8217;s something about the artwork (and the fact alone that&#xA0;there is artwork speaks volumes) that makes me think of pre-&#xAD;war Shanghai, or of those Solvil et&#xA0;Titus TV ads from the early 90s. I think it&#8217;s the facial features of the characters. They look a little&#xA0;bit Asian. So, when the &#8220;good&#8221; love interest was introduced as &#8220;Shiye&#8221;, I became convinced that it&#xA0;was Mandarin, pronounced &#8220;Shih&#xAD;-Yeh&#8221;. It was a little exciting, for me: I like seeing my race&#xA0;represented. This might have been a misconception on my part, however.</p>
<p>Beautiful as the presentation is, the actual interaction is very sparse. There is a lot of text in&#xA0;between each choice, and, as a consequence, not much in the way of choice. Thankfully, there is&#xA0;an option that allows you to skip text passages that you have read before when you replay: this&#xA0;saves one the annoyance of fishing for those small&#xAD;-but-possibly-significant changes wrought by&#xA0;different choices.</p>
<p>Things are painted a little too black &#xAD;and &#xAD;white for my tastes, however. The &#8220;bad&#8221; love interest,&#xA0;Abel, is a little too bad, and therefore unconvincing as a love interest. Some good is ascribed to&#xA0;him in the form of his relationship with James, a servant (or slave?) boy in his care, but this is&#xA0;barely explored, and doesn&#8217;t seem to fit into a coherent image with what is already known about&#xA0;him. As well, Shiye&#8217;s democratic ideals are just a little too perfect. We don&#8217;t get into why anyone&#xA0;might think they&#8217;re a bad idea, other than that they challenge the privileged status quo. And we&#xA0;should: Our heroine, as a member of the aristocracy, should have been steeped in monarchist&#xA0;rhetoric since the day of her birth and if she isn&#8217;t, we ought to know why. I wonder if perhaps so&#xA0;much time was spent on the presentation that the development of the story had to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a game with a lot of potential to be fleshed out into something much bigger and deeper. When&#xA0;all is said and done, I would be interested in seeing what else this world has to offer.</p>
<p>When I finally dragged Macdougal away from the musician a half hour later, she was still on the same piece of music. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Jellicoe&#8217;s somewhere about, I know, and he ought to be&#xA0;up to his elbows in small children by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I never did like Jellicoe very much. He has all the sincerity of a crocodile trying to sell you on a&#xA0;haircut. But if there&#8217;s one thing he&#8217;s good at, it&#8217;s at organising small children and keeping them&#xA0;entertained. Naturally, he&#8217;s always the first choice to be in charge of the crafts table where all the&#xA0;village parents leave their children for the day&#8217;s outing.</p>
<p>He thrust a large wicker basket at us as soon as we came within spitting distance. &#8220;Here,&#8221; he said,&#xA0;&#8220;grab some materials and join in. The fun&#8217;s just beginning.&#8221; Without looking, Macdougal plunged&#xA0;both hands into the basket and came up with a sponge, a strip of foil, and a knitting needle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I supposed to do with these?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>But Jellicoe, in a whirl of paper scraps and glitter, had run off to attend to some small but&#xA0;enterprising young artists at the other end of the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to make do with what you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; I told Macdougal. &#8220;You should have looked a&#xA0;little more carefully before you picked out whatever rubbish Jellicoe had available in his crafts&#xA0;basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macdougal sat down and arranged his three prizes on the table before him. &#8220;Maybe I can make a&#xA0;sort of table ornament&#8230;?&#8221; he faltered. I couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle at his discomfiture.</p>
<h4>5. Mere Anarchy</h4>
<p>&#8220;Mere Anarchy&#8221; presents us with a world in which magic exists, and its secrets are jealously&#xA0;guarded by an elite society of practitioners; meanwhile, there are small, marginalised groups of&#xA0;magic&#xAD; users operating outside this elite society: the &#8220;anarchists&#8221;, of whom our hero is one. The&#xA0;story is presented in Undum, which seems to have as its central conceit this idea that one is,&#xA0;through one&#8217;s choices, crafting a single, coherent story, one which can be read from beginning to&#xA0;end once the game is done.</p>
<p>But to me, the most intriguing thing about &#8220;Mere Anarchy&#8221; is the way in which the central puzzle&#xA0;is organised: one begins by selecting one&#8217;s tools, without any clear idea of what one might&#xA0;encounter; and then one selects one of two targets &#xAD;&#xAD; or, rather, one of two collection of obstacles&#xA0;that the previously&#xAD;-chosen tools are meant to overcome. While each tool may be used in either of&#xA0;the two possible scenarios, I get the distinct impression that each tool is best suited for one or the&#xA0;other, but not both. It&#8217;s a little bit backwards, like choosing questions to match one&#8217;s answers. But&#xA0;in a way, given the way the story is set up and given the nature of Undum as a vehicle for&#xA0;producing these discrete, coherent artifacts as an end-product of play, it&#8217;s almost as if one were&#xA0;changing reality to suit one&#8217;s available resources. That&#8217;s magic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how much impact the rest of the choices have on the story. They may just be&#xA0;window dressing. But the overall end-result is pleasing, a coherent whole, and satisfying.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what have you made?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a magic wand. See, you wave it, and magic happens.&#8221; Macdougal waved his &#8220;wand&#8221;, but the&#xA0;only magic I could see happening was the flash of light reflecting off the foil-wrapped sponge star&#xA0;stuck on the end of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very impressed,&#8221; I said, completely unimpressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; Macdougal countered, sticking his &#8220;wand&#8221; into a jacket pocket, &#8220;perhaps we should&#xA0;move on? Should we go back to the violinist?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &#8220;I think the treasure hunt is about to begin. There&#8217;s old Mr Gresham on the&#xA0;podium, and I see a box of envelopes beside him &#8212; those would be the clues to get us started, I&#8217;ll&#xA0;wager&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit that the treasure hunt is always the highlight of the fair as far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#xA0;Clue in hand, Macdougal and I hared off as soon as the starting pistol was fired. I&#8217;d never done the&#xA0;hunt in a team before, but then I&#8217;d never won it either: and Macdougal, once absorbed in the&#xA0;activity, was a dedicated hunter.</p>
<h4>6. Toby&#8217;s Nose</h4>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m old-&#xAD;fashioned, but this is more the sort of thing I expect when I think of IF. It&#8217;s about&#xA0;the puzzle to be unravelled, and the exploration of the story. In &#8220;Toby&#8217;s Nose&#8221;, the puzzle IS the&#xA0;exploration. We&#8217;re a dog here, a dog with a sense of smell so sophisticated it can conjure up entire&#xA0;scenes from a the scents around him, and further examine these scenes as though he were actually&#xA0;there.&#xA0;I&#8217;m willing to suspend my disbelief for this one.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re investigating a murder. To this end, we&#8217;re examining each scent around us, and then&#xA0;examining (well, smelling) the scents within the image conjured by the initial scent, and then&#xA0;further in, and yet further in&#8230;. It&#8217;s like opening up a Russian nesting doll. But what it also soon&#xA0;becomes is an exercise in checking every single noun in the text, in case there might be more&#xA0;information to be had there. A textual pixel-hunt, if you will.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind that sort of thing. Noun-hunting is easier and more interesting than pixel-hunting, in&#xA0;my opinion.&#xA0;What emerges is a story in which each character has his or her own tale to tell, their tales existing&#xA0;independently but weaving together into the tapestry of the larger plot. That&#8217;s a very fine thing, the&#xA0;ideal one aims for when dealing with multiple characters.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the game doesn&#8217;t tell you when you&#8217;ve found enough evidence to make your&#xA0;accusation. You&#8217;re a dog, so you can&#8217;t explain your logic to the humans around you, anyway. It&#8217;s&#xA0;up to you, the player, to consider all the information given, and to figure it out on your own. The&#xA0;game doesn&#8217;t tell you if one clue is more significant than another, nor does it ring any alarm bells&#xA0;when significant matches are made between one detail and another. On the one hand, trusting the&#xA0;player &#8212; leaving open the possibility of a solution found through save&#xAD;and-restore guesswork&#xAD;&#xAD;&#xA0;strikes me as a negative thing. And yet, there is something to be said for trusting the player to&#xA0;think for himself.&#xA0;Personally, I enjoyed the exploration, the digging deeper into this family&#8217;s closets, the game of&#xA0;discovery. It&#8217;s why I like IF.</p>
<p>The hamper, first prize for solving the treasure hunt, was rather large &#8212; a little too bulky to manage&#xA0;on my own. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; Mr Gresham wheezed, &#8220;that&#8217;s because the treasure hunt is best done in&#xA0;teams of two or more. You knew that, surely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I admitted. All those years of going it alone! Ah well, all I needed now was a hand from&#xA0;Macdougal, but the fellow had slipped off somewhere, leaving me to handle the prize myself.&#xA0;Perhaps, I thought, perhaps if I opened it up and extracted the contents? But no, there was a reason&#xA0;everything had been packed together into a hamper, and that was that the prize was several bottles&#xA0;of &#8230; that strange not-beer that Macdougal had fetched from the beer tent earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;A year&#8217;s supply,&#8221; chuckled Mr Gresham. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to want help shifting that lot.&#8221; He waved&#xA0;someone over: of all people, the carnival geek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no need: my friend will be back momentarily.&#8221; But Mr Gresham was getting&#xA0;deaf: he only smiled genially, clapped me on the shoulder and went off to join his gaggle of&#xA0;political cronies. The carnival geek leered unsettlingly, and I took a step back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh hey!&#8221; Thank goodness, it was Macdougal. He was weaving through the crowd with the&#xA0;violinist close behind him. &#8220;Hey!&#8221; he repeated as he drew up, &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mind, but I&#8217;m&#xA0;going to be a little busy this evening. Yu&#xAD;-er and I are having supper at the hotel&#8230;.&#8221;&#xA0;The violinist &#8212; Yu-er &#8212; smiled demurely and bowed her head. The carnival geek continued to leer&#xA0;at me unsettlingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8230; Macdougal, what about the treasure hunt prize?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll manage.&#8221; Macdougal fished out the &#8220;magic wand&#8221; he&#8217;d made at Jellicoe&#8217;s craft&#xA0;table &#8212; a sponge cut into a star shape, wrapped in foil and stuck on the end of a knitting needle &#8212; and handed it to me. &#8220;Here, maybe this will help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth am I supposed to do with this? Wave it and expect miracles?&#8221; I was a tad miffed&#xA0;with Macdougal at this point, I admit. I brandished the &#8220;wand&#8221; at him threateningly. &#8220;Look! I&#8217;m&#xA0;waving the wand and nothing is happening! Oh, maybe I&#8217;m supposed to say a magic word too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Xyzzy&#xAD;&#xAD;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was sitting in the fortune-teller&#8217;s tent with a year&#8217;s supply of mystery liquor.</p>
<p>I put Macdougal&#8217;s magic wand down on the table between us. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t make this,&#8221; I said. &#8220;My&#xA0;friend Macdougal made it. Does that count?&#8221;</p>
<p>The fortune-teller shrugged and reached for one of the bottles. &#8220;There are worse fates,&#8221; she said.&#xA0;&#8220;Cheers.&#8221;</p>

      <p>I did like the image of &#x201C;batter being thrown in my face from across the room&#x201D; &#x2014; very dynamic. The one sour note was its imputation of bad faith: that INCL was a performative provocation instead of sincere art. The carnival geek here only magnifies that mischaracterization. Your structural criticism is much appreciated, but your distrust of my sincerity calls for a response.</p> <p>I did not put months of thought and care into A Trial aiming to irritate or confuse people. Its primary purpose is just as you&#x2019;ve said, to move the spirit. Did I think it might vex some players, given all the experimenting? Yes, so I made an honest effort to combat that. If you think I didn&#x2019;t do enough to engage the audience, very well, but don&#x2019;t suggest that I wrote it just to mess with you.</p>
