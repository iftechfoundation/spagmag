VERSION: Version 1.07

The first modern IF game that I ever played was <a href="i.html#I-0">I-0</a>. I downloaded it because
its description began with the words: Warning: sexually explicit. It actually
wasn't that explicit, but I enjoyed it anyway, and I thought that its author,
Adam Cadre, was someone whose career deserved to be followed. This was the year
2001, or maybe 2002. So suffice to say I wasn't making any new nor slightly
original discovery.

But then there was nothing. I mostly forgot about him and his works. I decided
I wanted to write my own games, so I had to learn Inform well enough as to
accommodate it to the ideas I had. One of these ideas was this story that I
wanted to tell in this particular non-linear way. One day, while I was already
struggling with the program, a friend came home and asked me what I was working
on, an so I told her. She inmediately said: `That looks a lot like <a href="p.
html#photopia">Photopia</a>.'
`What's that?' `It's a piece of IF written by Adam Cadre. It's pretty good,
though I missed the puzzles. It's almost puzzleless.' I am the optimistic kind,
so I didn't let that bring me down. `I have another idea. It's completely
different. In this one the PC dies several times before completing the game. I
like it because it's stretching the limits of the genre, you know, the death of
the PC as the real end of the game and all that.' `Oh', she said. `Oh, what?',
I asked, surprised by her lack of amazement at my talent. `That's <a href="s.
html#shrapnel">Shrapnel</a>.'
`Shrapnel?' `Another game by Adam Cadre.' `No shit.' `No shit at all.' `Oh.'
Now I'm glad I didn't tell her about my last idea: a game in which the PC
assumes to be someone that he later finds out he was not. Anyway, that was the
moment when I began to hate Adam. And it explains too why I haven't written any
games to date. I'm still waiting for an idea he hasn't had yet.

Narcolepsy is my favorite IF game. And that's because it is, in a way, the
ultimate game. It's not that I think you can't do any better, I just don't
believe that anyone can make something substantially different with the current
development tools. Adam (with the help of his collaborators) has not pushed the
limits any further on this one, he just has reached them.

So, let me get this straight, are you saying that IF has reached its limits
with this game? No. What I'm saying is that certain development tools are
finally falling short for IF writing.

Look at books. Real books from your shelves. Do you think we have reached the
limits of them as a form of expression? And they've been here for more than
five hundred years (in their printed form). How could IF, which has been around
for barely thirty, reach its own? I think we need new development tools, and we
need to base them on a new paradigm, because all those that exist today have
not been made with that idea in mind. Most have been designed following this
reasoning: Well, I have Inform, but Inform has this limitation I want to
overcome, so I'm gonna create my own system and it will let me do what I need.
But what you want or need is not the ultimate frontier of IF. It's just 
Inform++.

We need a paradigm, something that clearly defines what IF is and is not, and I
think this should be the book. The real book. Remember some of the surrealists'
works, remember Finnegans Wake. (I'm not talking about Literature here, but
about aesthetics, about typography, about Fine Arts applied to the
communication of the written word. Why can't I as an author place the elements
of a game precisely on the screen and expect that every player could see what I
intended them to see and just the way I wanted to independently of the device
and platform the game is run on? Is it possible to write games in Greek, or
even just words in exotic alphabets? How easy it is to translate a game?) Have
we got that far yet? No. And we still should add the features that come with
interactivity and computing. (Can you easily change the way the parser works so
it can accept, for example, input in a programming language or even in an
invented one?) So how can Narcolepsy be the end of IF? It just can't. It just
can't. It's all a matter of freedom. If you're writing a book, you can't make a
movie, but you still can decide if you want to write poetry or a novel or an
essay or a play. Or mix formats or whatever. You know what you cannot do, you
know your limits, but, inside those, you must be allowed to do what you want
any way you want to and to do it easily. Right?

But I digress, so let's get back to the game. In it you play a narcoleptic, and
this gives the whole thing a surrealistic atmosphere. When you live in dreams
as much time as you do in reality, almost everything that happens to you, no
matter how strange, looks like normal, because your own situation is weirder.
And that's the exact sensation you get when playing Narcolepsy. That you may be
the only normal person in town and all the rest be weirdos, but, at the same
time, if you're the only one who's normal, that means you're the weirdo.

One question: Did any of you identify with the PC? I didn't, and that made me
feel a kind of double-sided estrangement: one between the PC and his world, and
the other between the PC and me. But it was a good thing, because it stimulated
that sense of alienation the author --I think-- wants us to experience. Quick
theoretical note: Is it important to feel identified with the PCs?

On the technical side, the game is outstanding (I especially like the way he
creates a complete and believable world without making the interaction too
complicated, as it did happen --in my humble opinion-- in Slouching Towards
Bedlam, for example). Probably the best thing about it, though, is that it is
fun, tons of, as all his other games; the worst being that it is dumb. That's
why most people will love it while they're playing, but will easily forget
about it afterwards. So what?, you might say. Yeah, I guess it all depends on
what you're looking for in a game. I, for one, would like to see ideas.
Something I could take home, like I did with Photopia. Games with ideas are as
scarce as hen's teeth, and they are not always the most praised ones.
Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why it is impossible to talk about
real IF criticism. Criticism's main goal is to promote discussion based on the
contents of some artwork, discussion that may lead to the evolution of that
form of art or even of our own lives. Something that is made only for fun can't
be discussed, because it is intellectually void. You can't criticise The Da
Vinci Code, because what would be the point? Would it make you wiser? Criticism
is not meant as a recommendation ("Oh, I wanna go to the movies. Let's see what
Roger Ebert says it's good.") just like wine is not meant to get you drunk. In
its ideal form it should be read a posteriori so it could be a dialogue (or a
monodialogue, as Unamuno put it) between the critic and the reader. A
discussion. An enhancement of the pleasure of the game/book/movie/whatever. If
there are no ideas in games, what can we say about them? Yeah, it was fun. I
hope you agree. Yes, I do. Oh, great. Well, bye. Bye. Lack of ideas and lack of
author's freedom. Those are the challenges the IF community (if such exists)
should face in the foreseeable future. That is, if they want to call themselves
artists and not just amateurs.

IF is still in its teens, and we know only people like Mozart or Rimbaud have
done something really valuable and mature in their teens.

As for the author, I'll just say this: John Carpenter used to distinguish
between two kinds of film directors: the Hitchcocks and the Hawks. His point
was that in Hitchcock you can see what he's doing, you can see why he is so
good; Howard Hawks, on the other hand, is just as good, but he's invisible.
Adam Cadre is a Hitchcock. His brilliance is (mostly) in what you see. IF seems
to be for him an intellectual game. What can I do now that hasn't been done
yet? I wish he was not so brilliant, but more profound (what can I say now that
hasn't been said yet?). I wish he was a Billy Wilder.

<A NAME="never"><h2>Nevermore</h2>

TITLE: Nevermore

VERSION: Release 10

Literary adaptation is an underpopulated IF genre, and Nate Cull's
Nevermore is a thoughtful and well-intentioned attempt at bringing Poe's
"The Raven" to the world of IF. While what emerges isn't a bad game,
it's less the poem than a series of events in a similar setting with a
somewhat similar mood, In other words, if you're a particular fan of the
poem, you might not well not be a fan of this game.

As it happens, I committed "The Raven" to memory when I was in seventh
grade or so, and I still like the poem even though I've somewhat
belatedly realized that it's not a very good poem. (It's been said that
the popularity of Poe's poems varies inversely with their quality, and
while that's not strictly true--he wrote some lousy poems that remain
thoroughly obscure--the three Poe poems that are probably the best
known, "The Raven," "Annabel Lee," and "The Bells", are far from his
best.) That is, I like it despite its repetitiveness and its tendency to
use 20 words when two or three would do, simply because I like the drama
of it. No one would ever call "The Highwayman" a great poem, but it's
definitely a good ghost story in verse form that's well suited for being
read aloud; ditto, I think, for "The Raven," and I still enjoy being
able to recite it--and "The Highwayman" and others--from memory. So when
I saw the initial premise of Nevermore, my first reaction was something
between "Cool!" and disappointment that I hadn't gotten there first,
because it was an idea I'd been kicking around (very casually). And when
I saw that the game was using snippets from the poem but not binding the
player to the text, I said, aha, perfect--use the poem's story, its
strong point, but don't bind us to the text, which isn't its strong
point. Just use the text for echo effect.

It was about five moves into the game that the author's vision of the
poem diverged from mine, however, and it continued to diverge more and
more over the course of the game. This, in a sense, is good: had the
author felt constrained not to offend fellow fans of the poem and
slavishly followed the text, the result wouldn't have been much
different from reading the text itself. But I had such a hard time
squaring the author's vision with mine that before long I simply forgot
the origin of the game and no longer associated it with my mental images
of the setting as portrayed in the poem; it was just, in other words,
another comp entry. This is partly because the plot of Nevermore
involves elements like alchemy, pagan rituals, and lots of drugs, and it
would have been an odd coincidence if both the author and I had imagined
those things as part of a more fleshed-out story--but it's more that the
mood differed from the mood as I imagined it. To take one among many
examples, the protagonist of Nevermore takes cocaine approximately every
20 moves; if you don't, you're told that "a dull, dark weariness drifts
over you," which leads to death in a few moves if not corrected with
cocaine (at which point "a sense of raw alertness rushes through your
nerves, setting them all on edge"). It's certainly not implausible to
view the mood of the poem's subject as more generally consistent with "a
dull, dark weariness" than a cocaine-fueled "raw alertness," though--I
mean, it's a pretty melancholy poem--and I simply couldn't fit the
protagonist of Nevermore into my preconceived image. (Well, okay, the
poem's subject summons up some energy toward the end, but there's an
obvious cause that isn't cocaine.) In short, the author has his own
rather distinctive vision of who the protagonist is and what the poem's
about, and Your Mileage May Vary.

All that aside, the game works reasonably well, though it's not
flawless. The cocaine habit mentioned about doesn't add much to the
game, and it recurs frequently enough to be irritating after a while.
The puzzles also depend on a set of books that you're required to read,
while is fine except that (a) the snippets in the books are randomized,
so it's possible to miss one even if you've seen all the other snippets
twice or more, and (b) the snippets are written in a sort of
pseudo-medieval English that takes an awful lot of work to make sense
of. (Impenetrable poetry I can deal with; impenetrable puzzle-solving
instructions are more of a problem.) It's also easy to push the game
into unwinnable states, and though there's a WINNABLE command (which
informs you whether the game is presently in such a state), I would have
preferred game design that simply makes it a little harder to screw up
(or, better, is more forgiving when you do screw up). The opacity of the
instructions also had me stumped for a while toward the end--it turned
out that I'd left out a key step in the puzzle-solving and hadn't
realized it (and there aren't really contextual hints that could suggest
what you might have done wrong).

This is sounding more negative than I mean to be, because there were
parts of Nevermore that I genuinely enjoyed. The ending, for one thing,
is terrific--dark and dripping with irony. (In that respect, quite
faithful to Poe himself.) Some of the action turns on flashbacks, which
also struck me as genuinely Poeish--a protagonist for whom the past is
more real than the present absolutely belongs in this game. The writing
is strong--economical and atmospheric--and the box quotes from Edgar are
nicely placed (though, curiously, the last and most dramatic part of the
poem is largely absent). The personality of the protagonist even felt
right--an odd mix of sentimentality and obsessiveness.

Nevermore does a lot of things right, and you could argue that it did as
well as any work of IF could do in adapting this particular poem; it's
certainly a worthy attempt. Through no fault of the game, however, it
didn't really connect with me, and I gave it a 7 in the competition.

VERSION: Release 1

Necrotic Drift contains all the elements you'd expect of Robb --
bittersweet schmaltz, randomised combat, human, sympathetic characters,
tangential epigrammatic title, brilliant squick-out humour, big
textdumps and a streak of geek a mile wide. There are plenty of
references to previous Sherwin games, particularly <a href = "f.html#fallacy">Fallacy of Dawn</a> and
<a href = "c.html#chicks">Chicks Dig Jerks</a>. It's his biggest and most skilful game to date.

Big, but linear. You have an intro section (near-isomorphic to the
Fallacy of Dawn intro), then another intro, then a run-up, and *then*
the game proper starts. After that, you have an endgame and an epilogue.
At most significant steps, there will be a great big textdump; I don't
object to these too much, but they certainly add to the game's apparent
size. Nonetheless, it plays relatively quickly; most of the puzzles are
pretty straightforward, and the game gives you a pretty good idea about
what you should be aiming at next. (Sometimes this is a little
heavy-handed, as in the bit where an ally starts clearing a barrier and
suggests you look around for items that might be useful beyond said
barrier; generally they're pretty good, though).

Compared to previous games of Robb's, it's much more technically sturdy;
not too many awfully obscure puzzles, no jagged edges a betatester
should have caught, better implementation all-round. The old problems
are still there, though; the one item you need to use in a room is
generally strikingly prominent, scenery objects are often very flat and
unresponsive. Of course, the scenery is brought alive very well in room
descriptions and so on -- it just doesn't handle interactive poking
around too well. One or two puzzles seemed very illogical or badly
flagged up, and I underwent a lot of frustrating death at one point
before seeking out hints; most were along the lines of 'you just found
this item so it must be the one for the next puzzle'. I also note that
Sherwin has at last developed his combat system above the 'I attack, but
miss, the skeleton! The skeleton attacks and hits me!' level that so
thoroughly killed <a href = "c.html#crimson">A Crimson Spring</a>, albeit only to add amusingly awkward
battle-cries. Of course, since the thing is a D&D parody, formulaic
combat descriptions are par for the course. I doubt it'd lose much to
audiences unfamiliar with D&D, however; everything that needs to be
explained is explained, and there are contextual jokes but not really
any in-jokes.

The game managed to convey a pretty damn good feeling of the urgency of
the situation and the trepidation about moving into unknown areas. On
the other hand, when the annoyingly low inventory limit forced you to
scuttle back and forth looking for abandoned items at far corners of the
mall, this effect was lost somewhat. (This also tended to happen during
Dramatic Confrontations, which were kind of undermined by having the
ability to run off and come back multiple times). There's a principle in
IF theory that, in character-driven games, descriptive writing should
convey as much about the character and his world as about the object
described; this game goes joyously and superbly over the top with this
principle. This compensates for the lack of physical detail to a great
extent. The confinement and triviality of the Mall (and the intimate
knowledge Duffy has of it) give us a very good idea of how narrow
Duffy's horizons are. While in FoD New Haz felt like a sprawling
metropolis or at least a very big town, here it feels like a
claustrophobic little dead-end.

The multimedia works and it doesn't work. The use of images has improved
significantly; in FoD, the images were used kind of inconsistently, with
some inventory items having objects and others not. In ND they're
sharper and better used. There are a great many images, they contribute
greatly towards setting the mood and establishing characters, and it's
obvious that a monumental amount of care and effort has gone into them.
Some images of characters still seems a little awkward and
obviously-posed, however. Subject-matter makes things tougher, too --
even if you've got a multi-million CGI and modelling team behind you, if
you're depicting the undead you've only got a one in three chance that
it won't look ludicrous. Given that, much of this was pretty impressive,
and where it was cheesy it was forgivable.

The use of music wasn't as good. I found it kept fading out into
nothing, and then when a new piece of music was triggered it'd cut in
jarringly. I get the distinct impression that Robb, like quite a few
other authors, is trying to use IF as a poor man's cinema; perhaps
consciously so. The thing is, music is hard to get right with IF. Both
are non-static media, but IF's non-static nature is interspersed with
static blocks of reading time, particularly in this game. You'll get a
dramatic chord and -- whoa, a zombie image! -- but you'll have read down
three lines of text before the zombie *actually* jumps you. It's like
watching a movie where the dialogue is properly in sync but the music is
a few beats off. I think music has applications to IF, potentially, and
I can see that this is more or less going in the right direction -- it's
aimed at atmospheric background mood-setting stuff, and as such it's
well-chosen. Those cut-ins need work, though I don't know how you'd
manage that ideally.

The Love Interest is, zombies aside, the real focus of the story, and
it's handled well. It becomes pretty obvious that undead-fighting --
much like D&D -- is a great excuse for Duffy to ignore his relationship
crisis. The relationship stuff isn't deeply original or earthshakingly
moving, but it's very human. It works least well, perhaps, at the more
tender moments -- much like the protagonist's life-affirming speech to
the demon wherein he explains why he plays D&D. Sherwin is eminently
comfortable with crafting humour, but it feels that there's less craft
in the heartfelt stuff. No shame in that; writing heartfelt stuff is
hard. The typical authorial error (thinking heartfelt stuff needs *less*
craft because it's heartfelt) doesn't look as if it's been committed
here, but I think this is an area that could do with being addressed.
Modern audiences have been saturated with tacky pop-culture
representations of the subject; it's a cliche minefield. Re-used phrases
and sentiments seethe around it. They need to be avoided like the
plague.

I played in tandem with Jacqueline Lott; she objected vehemently to the
unavoidable ending. The problem I have with it is that the emotional
guts of the piece are kept at arm's length from the player, either
entrenched in the middle of big passages of text or as involuntary
actions. For Jacqueline, this was annoying because you couldn't
influence the outcome; for me, it was annoying because it made me less
involved with the outcome and hence cared less about it. Inevitable
outcomes are fine in my book, but the bulk of an IF story (and hence its
major developments) should really be interactive.

Now, I loved Fallacy of Dawn to bits, and this is clearly a better game,
on many many levels, than Fallacy of Dawn. (Sorry for going on and on
with the comparisons, but this game invites comparisons, plies them with
hors d'oeuvres and wine, and then suggests an S&M orgy to them once
they're good and drunk). So why do I feel more indifferent towards
Necrotic? Mostly, I think, because it's not enough of a departure. We
have crudely wisecracking geeks in a grimy, dystopic future,
well-employed graphics, a sassy girlfriend and a crass best buddy who
follow us about... to be honest, it feels more like a liberal remake
than a sequel. And y'know how remakes are never looked on as fondly even
if they're technically superior? Right.

The first thing a potential player is likely to notice about Necrotic
Drift is its size. 38MB is a huge filesize for what we've become used to
thinking of as 'text adventures'. It's worth the download if you've got
even reasonably fast dial-up, and anyone with broadband shouldn't even
be thinking twice about it. Included in this package is a .pdf manual,
presented as a copy of 'Which Witch?' magazine. It's a nice feelie, and
although the language is needlessly colorful in parts, is good for a
chuckle. Instructions for playing the game are included in the .pdf, and
integrated nicely as part of the magazine.

The game starts off fairly slowly. The opening scenes really don't mesh
well with the rest of the game, and some of the dialogue and two of the
main character's friends are truly unpleasant. I can see the point to
some of what goes on here: it does establish some of Jarret's (the main
character) personality and his situation in life. All of this is in
retrospect, though. At the time, it just felt sort of forced,
occasionally amusing, and largely pointless. The beginning of a game
should grab a player's interest, not make them think "I'll give it a few
more turns to see if anything more interesting happens." The game does
pick up nicely, thankfully. The writing is superior after the slow
start, and both the audio and graphical aspects, not normally seen in
IF, add a great deal to the experience.

At its most basic, Necrotic Drift is Survival Horror in IF style. Jarret
can only take so much damage before the game ends, and there are a
number of 'surprise' attacks in darkened corridors. But there's a lot
more here than blasting everything in sight, primarily because standard
weapons aren't in great supply. This is IF, and in IF, puzzles rule.
There are specific ways to get past every obstacle, all very logical,
but all requiring that the player pay very close attention. There's a
lot to notice, many small details that the author has added that really
add to the atmosphere of the game, and many of those are important. More
than likely, you won't manage to get through on the first attempt, but
that makes success that much more satisfying when it comes.

None of the puzzles are all that difficult on a second attempt, if the
player is paying attention, but that's not really the point of the game.
The conversations and encounters drive what is, at it's heart, a story
about relationships. There's as much being said here about loss, love,
and friendship as there is about beasts that go bump in the night, and
that's what really marks Necrotic Drift as a superior game. The plot is
linear, and there seem to be some unavoidably tragic parts, but that's
okay. The story is a quality one and if there's some sadness to go along
with that, well, sometimes a bit of sorrow is necessary to make the
happiness seem that much more valuable.

Jonathan Fry's A New Day is another in a fairly long list of games
that were nice in theory but not a real joy to play. Though the
premise is interesting and though the plot is well-designed, mostly,
the challenges of A New Day felt more like annoyances, and I never
really got into the game.

The plot, in all its self-referential glory: you are venturing
into/playing a partially completed text adventure whose author, one
Jonathan Fry, has died mysteriously; you confront a sentient being
named Winston who seems to be running the show inside Jonathan's
computer. The &quot;incomplete&quot; element means that objects are there but
not mentioned, and some room descriptions are entirely absent or very
terse. Even if you understand what you're doing in the game -- not all
that likely -- it's still hard to make any sense of what you, the
player, are supposed to do next, since you don't get much direction;
as is typical, you are tossed into settings and given things to
do. (As has been pointed out, there is a built-in excuse here for
flaws in the game -- &quot;it's an unfinished game, dummy&quot; -- but I assume
that Mr. Fry won't take refuge in that.)

There are some problems that can't be put down to the unfinished-game
element, though, like a location requiring that the player SEARCH
three times -- finding something on the first and third times but not
on the second (and, obviously, no clue that there's something more
when you search the second time). Syntax for getting a cat across a
street is rather unlikely, and the solution to a puzzle involving a
guard assumes considerable stupidity on the guard's part. And try as I
might, I could _not_ visualize the last puzzle, nor figure out why the
solution suggested by the hints was correct.

One of the more interesting decisions that Mr. Fry made was to make
one of the sections of the game simulate a software crash of sorts, so
that the text comes out garbled -- or, I should say, @#$^ s@#$ft@#@e
cr@#!sh s} th8723 the t523xt c&*@es @%@#$t ga^%23482@(*bled. I
exaggerate only slightly -- a sample sentence:

    Spli0LAS99x
    Broken gla31s and dsi8 wiring de76f746t the deca##]
    wo_)2den49053en walls of this room.

There are very few moments in IF that I have wanted to be over as
quickly as I wanted this one to be over, and, unfortunately, it took a
while to end, since there's a not-all-that-intuitive puzzle to solve
that assumes you have VERY sharp eyes. All this gets points for
verisimilitude, I guess, but giving the player a headache is not the
sort of verisimilitude we're striving for, nor even the k2342nd of
veris27@#^@^@#de we're str][;,ving for.

A New Day is, for the most part, technically proficient; other than
the unfairnesses mentioned above, there aren't many design problems,
and no bugs at all as far as I could tell. Somehow, though, I didn't
enjoy it; I didn't feel like the plot went anywhere, and the story
felt uninvolving.  Well, the plot did go somewhere, true, but it
didn't precisely progress there; you're given a situation at the
beginning, you do a bunch of things that don't relate directly to the
situation, and then the situation changes suddenly at the end. Perhaps
some hints at the final revelation -- perhaps things that you discover
along the way that point to it, rather than having it all dumped on
you without warning -- might help in that respect; for me, that
development was a sort of &quot;oh, really?&quot; bit. I hadn't really been
thinking about it, to be honest, as I'd been busy trying to solve
unrelated puzzles. If the idea is to figure out how Fry died, it might
be good to have some of the puzzles actually concern him or the
setting of his death, lest the whole thing feel disconnected. (I
recognize that the behavior of a certain character may be intended to
point to that, but it didn't really work for me.)

My, I do seem to be complaining, don't I? There are plenty of
well-done things about A New Day as well. The ending feels genuinely
suspenseful -- though a little mysterious, since you have very little
idea of what's going on. There are multiple solutions to several
puzzles, a welcome touch, though I admit I only found a few. At one
point, you get bad advice from an NPC, and though normally it would
feel unfair to do something like this -- when there's no obvious
reason not to trust the NPC -- it works well here, I found. (At least,
I was sufficiently unsure about the NPC not to take the advice.) One
puzzle involving crossing a street breaks IF conventions in a
thoroughly welcome way; it does something that seems like common sense
but is almost never actually implemented, and I was glad that this
game rewarded common sense (though, for those who have been playing IF
for a while, it's actually not common sense anymore). More generally,
the idea is well-thought-out and intriguing, even if I never got into
the plot, and there's potential for a much longer and more- involved
game where the plot might move along better. At least, it seems so to
me; it seems like there's much that can be done with exploring a
computer. (Find a file directory tree and chop it down. Hee hee hee.)
Though this particular effort is a little short (though I shouldn't
fault Mr. Fry for obeying the two-hour limit, I know), it has ideas
that could make a longer game quite intriguing.

Even so, there are difficulties in A New Day that, while not fatal to
its playability, made it less than enjoyable for me; perhaps it's a
matter of taste, but I don't claim to be sufficiently objective to
transcend these things. Though this is a good effort, and Mr. Fry is
clearly a good programmer, I gave this one a 6 on the competition
scale.

VERSION: Release 1

Once again, I have jumped ahead to a game later in my list. This time, it&#8217;s
because A New Life was recommended to me. If I really won&#8217;t have time to finish
all the games before November 15th, I might as well take them in any order,
right?

I&#8217;ll probably go back to the list now. I enjoyed this game, but I found it
incredibly difficult. Maybe it&#8217;s just me and my sub-par puzzle-solving
abilities, but I was only able to complete the game down the path set by the
walkthrough. I was already over two hours into the game my own way, using the
built-in hint system more and more, and I had exhausted all of those options. I
may have been in an unwinnable state. I&#8217;m not sure.

It&#8217;s a very unique story, hinting at parallel realities and mythical races
where a person&#8217;s gender can be changed from time to time. While playing, I kept
wondering if the goblins were really humans and vice-versa, but this was never
confirmed. A New Life has a lot going on, and much of it surfaces as memories 
(a &#8220;remember&#8221; command does this), or as considerations when examining scenery
or talking to the game&#8217;s characters. The back-story is an epic tapestry of
magic and mystery. Much of the fun comes from learning more and more about the
unique world in which the game is set, and about the people who inhabit it.

The biggest problem is, it&#8217;s sometimes (okay, often times) unclear what to do
without getting pointers from the hints. Even then, it can be a little
confusing. This is the kind of game that would be great outside the competition,
where it might be played over the course of three or four nights without that
two-hour mark looming ahead. I think it would be more rewarding taken at
leisure. I spent three hours on it, and the last of that was just typing from
the walkthrough. My original path might have been interesting, if I had been
able to figure it out. The thing with the three bags and the two staffs was
pretty clever, but even putting them to use, I never quite felt as though I had
solved everything. On my own plot branch, I couldn&#8217;t figure out what was
important about the stars and panels, even though I could make them light up as
described in the hints.

This is either a really great game I just didn&#8217;t fully understand, or a pretty
average game that does a great job of seeming to be a really great game I
didn&#8217;t fully understand. If taken without recommendation, I might have based it
at 6.5 or 7.0 &#8211; lower because of the complicated puzzles, and the lack of clear
objectives. This is the trap we fall into when judging a game we know is or
isn&#8217;t liked by others. If I&#8217;m to trust in someone else&#8217;s opinion, I have to
believe the game is better than it seems. And now it&#8217;s my turn, to pass my
opinion along to others by way of this review.

The writing in A New Life is excellent. This is one of the few games where the
text just flowed right. It wasn&#8217;t forced, it wasn&#8217;t overdone, and it wasn&#8217;t
choppy. Good writing makes a game seem more real, and when the unique world
seems to be the focus, that&#8217;s important. This is the basis for my +0.5 skew,
from a base of 7.5. A New Life may fare well in the competition. It&#8217;s a good
enough game: worth the time, but not my favorite. I recommend playing it
without expecting an easy, two-hour experience. Don&#8217;t rush, ease into it with
exploration and experimentation (looking, remembering, asking), and you&#8217;re
likely to have a great time.

<A NAME="night"><h2>A Night At The Museum Forever</h2>
From: Magnus Olsson &lt;mol SP@G df.lth.se&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag7.html">SPAG #7</a> -- October 14, 1995

  Name: A Night At The Museum Forever     Parser: TADS
  Author: Chris Angelini                  Plot: Linear, rather clever
  Email: cangelin SP@G uoguelph.ca             Atmosphere: Weak
  Availability: F, IF Archive                    Writing: Adequate
  Puzzles: Simple, not too original       Supports: TADS ports
  Characters: None                        Difficulty: Quite simple

This game has been endowed with a slightly misleading title: it does
take place in a museum, but neither in one night or forever - three
thousand years would be more appropriate! The museum is a strange one
indeed: a temporal museum, with exhibits collected from both the past
and the future. Abandoned for a thousand years, it has been ransacked and
all the exhibits stolen.  All the exhibits, that is, but one. A priceless
diamond ring remains, and it is your mission to retrieve it, a task which
is harder than it seems, since the ring's presence involves a temporal
paradox.  Fortunately, the museum's time machine is still in working
order... 

Resolving the paradox and retrieving the ring isn't that difficult;
in fact, the game is quite small and easy, just as the competition
entries should be. Both in style and execution it's quite similar to
an early Infocom game (a treasure hunt through a deserted house
containing some interesting gadgets as well as more commonplace
objects, all conveniently placed where you can find them). The writing
is not quite up to Infocom's standards, but quite adequate; the
puzzles may not be very original but are clever and logical; the plot
is simple but quite clever and the time travel is handled nicely.

My only big complaint about the game is its almost total lack of
atmosphere. After all, you're exploring a mysterious, deserted museum
where many explorers/looters before you have vanished in a temporal
paradox, you're travelling thousands of years back and forward in
time, and yet the author conveys almost no sense of wonder. It's almost
as if the hero would say &quot;OK, so I've resolved a temporal paradox
and retrieved a priceless ring before lunch today. Maybe I should take
the dog for a walk this afternoon?&quot;

In some circumstances, leaving the museum leads to sudden death. This
may be motivated by the plot, and anyway you can undo. What's worse,
however, is that leaving the museum under certain other circumstances
will cause the game to think you want to quit, and you're just taken
out of the program without even the chance to undo.  This is really a
Bad Thing since it's easy to take a wrong turn in the corridors - it
happened several times to me.

Despite these complaints, the game is quite clever and enjoyable. It
nicely meets the One Rule of the contest: to be solvable in two hours,
which is more than one can say for most of the more sophisticated
entries.

I didn't enjoy playing this at all.  Ninety percent of the game seemed
to consist of tramping back and forth along the corridor in the
different time zones, and the remaining ten percent was somewhat dull.
No people, no interesting puzzles, no colourful background, no
awe-inspiring future technology, nothing.  The game seems to have not
been playtested, and it raises rather more questions than it answers.

Why is the McGuffin something as prosaic as a diamond ring in a game
wanting for colour, when it could have been an exciting Heechee (tm)
gadget with miraculous properties?  Is the coal/diamond puzzle a
reference to &quot;<a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork I</a>,&quot; or is it just serendipity?  And anyway, how on
earth did the coal turn into a diamond when it was just buried in a hole
for 2000 years?  Why is there a starvation time limit when there is no
food in the game?  Is this just the infamous &quot;TADS has starvation and
sleep deprivation time limits unless you explicitly turn them off&quot; bug,
or is it deliberate?  Why does the walkthrough think I can refer to the
&quot;glass cover&quot; as a &quot;case&quot;?  And so on.

VERSION: Release 1.00

You wake up in bed. A reassuring start and one familiar from several
games. You are spared the precision manoeuvring that was required in
<a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</a>; instead, if you pick up the phone you
receive a message urging you to work. It is 9:05 and you have slept
longer than you intended...

The game plays smoothly with no real apparent problems - something might
strike you as strange when you are given a set of keys, but don't seem
to be able to lock the front door on the way out, but hey, this is
interactive fiction anyhow, and if we are prepared to accept endless
magical transportations and interdimensional shifts in other games, then
we should be able to deal with that. Also, the author's hand is clearly
seen to be pushing you in a certain direction late in the game, where
the line "Walk into Bowman's office without the form? Not smart."
appears, even though we can easily reach that stage without having
encountered the form yet. A petty point which doubtless could be dealt
with in the next version - and also one that shows the high standards
that IF has reached in recent years: if that's all we've go to moan
about, then we aren't being badly served by the current crop of writers.

Back to the game: play it once, definitely play it once, just to hear
yourself say "WHAT?" when you reach the end screen. Then play it again,
and investigate those nooks and crannies that you passed over the first
time... things shall become apparent. Play it that second time and reach
the best (?) resolution. On the basis of Cadre's earlier piece <a href = "i.html#I-0">I-0</a> (aka
Interstate Zero) I suspect that there may still be many hidden treasures
(not *TREASURES*) lurking in the background though - I played that one
through about eight or ten times and still missed out on at least half
the fun. I don't know though - there do seem to be only two ways out of
this set-up.

In the end, 9:05 is a simple game which could almost be described as
puzzle-less one - it does contain one puzzle which does not advertise
itself as such until it is way too late. It's a game that is somewhat
closer in spirit to Cadre's take on Flowers For Algernon than his other
more involved <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> or I-0.

As an end note, it is interesting to see that the whole game can be
cracked on the second move (if not completed on the third as was the
case for Flowers).

VERSION: 1.30

Score: 1 out of 10.

I started to write a rather cruel review, which started, "Why? Was there
a point? If so, what was it?" Then it abruptly occurred to me that there
might be a walkthrough, so I went looking for it. There wasn't one, but
the associated text file cued me off to the idea that "enter shrine"
might be different than "go shrine". Sure enough, it was, and I entered
the shrine. Shortly afterward, I won the game. (Trust me... it doesn't
take much.) So there was a point. Sort of.

You start in an ungrammatical, boring room, which includes a shrine that
you cannot enter and mountains that are too far away even to be
examined. Aside from various peculiarities of syntax and parsing, there
is one painfully obvious puzzle to be solved. I solved it. I won, or, at
least, I think I did. It didn't help that the game changed its idea of
what the maximum possible score was each time that I played it. I never
got the maximum possible score, but the part where an object disappeared
from existence after I picked it up may have something to do with it.

As well as the issues that were specific to the game, the system had
some issues of its own. I recommend Inform, TADS, HUGO, ADRIFT, or any
other developed and well-tested system to the author. This home-grown
system has to go. It kept flashing "20" on my input line past a certain
point, and it had lag on my input. Bleah!

I can't recommend playing this game for any reason.

VERSION: Release 1.0

When I play a Robb Sherwin game, I expect to see loads of ass-kicking
dialogue and inspired, crazed imagery. So the opening of this game was
quite a surprise: it all seemed strangely calm and muted, and even
dangerously close to being boring. But not so close that I stopped
playing immediately. As it turned out, the muted style is appropriate
for the fairly sombre events of the first section.

There is a lot of character-establishing text at the start, maybe too
much, but it was effective in drawing me into the role. After a while I
really became the PC. I wanted to make that deal, I was genuinely
shocked at seeing my wife unconscious, I genuinely wanted to save the
baby. That the game was able to make me feel that way shows it was doing
something right.

But then, after the second section, I stopped playing. Why? Maybe it's
something to do with the 'you die, then restart' gimmick. After spending
all that time in one character, suddenly I'm wrenched out and thrust
into a new one, and I have to go through the whole process of getting to
know them again. And that just seems too tiring. On the face of it, the
PC-changing in this game is not too different from the PC-changing in
<a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a>: but in Photopia, the breaks between PCs were cleaner and more
fluid than the ones here, and they happened regularly enough that I
didn't feel disoriented every time the character changed.

Skimming through the walkthrough, it looks like there is a lot of stuff
that I missed in this game, though, so maybe I'll come back to it
sometime.

  NAME:  Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It
                                      GAMEPLAY:  Infocom Standard
  AUTHOR:  Jeff O'Neill               PLOT:  Very Good

  CHARACTERS:  Very Good              DIFFICULTY:  Standard

        Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It is a collection of
interactive short stories, all revolving around the common theme of restoring
the town of Punster, and based on the idea that you can alter the nature of
reality merely by engaging in wordplay with it.
        The concept is difficult to explain, so some examples from the game's
sample transcript may illustrate it without giving away any of the actual
story.  You wake up, knocking over your alarm clock and a glass of water.
The only way to avoid the debris is to get up on the wrong side of the bed.
Asked to mail your father's tax return, you discover you can't find it.  But
that scruffy guy in the corner with the IRS tee shirt, who you're told is
barely male can be transmogrified with the homonym &quot;mail&quot;. The return isn't
stamped?  You can fix that by Spoonerizing your father's stone lamp into a
lone stamp.  And so on.
        To prevent this from becoming incredibly confusing, each short story
deals with only one specific type of wordplay.  The stories can be played in
any order, except for Meet the Mayor, which must come last.
        The parser is a bit better than the usual Infocom one.  Compass
directions and mapping are dispensed with entirely, as the Status Line
constantly lists all the areas that you can travel directly to.  As the maps
are generally small (one story has only two locations), the map can be easily
internalized in the player's mind.
        The puzzles are not the very best.  The nature of such a game means
that many of the puzzles will be of the &quot;guess what the author is thinking&quot; 
type.  Also, since the puzzles don't necessarily build on each other, but
often stand separately, you may finish a story only to be told that there
were more things you could have done, and be forced to return later.
However, since ALL versions of Nord & Bert have on-screen hints, there is no
chance of getting permanently stuck.
        The real strength of the game is in its Writing and Atmosphere.  The
mood created is delightfully surreal, and the constant clever descriptions
and responses make this one of the best &quot;reading&quot; text games ever produced.
Text game players like to argue that well-written text produces more
evocative images than graphic games do.  Nord and Bert goes beyond this, not
merely doing things BETTER than a graphics game could, but doing things that
a graphics game could never do at all.  Definitely one of Infocom's most
underrated classics.

puzzles are simply Go problems transplanted directly into the game.
(There's a booklet lying around for the heretofore uninitiated.) Not all
the puzzles are Go-related, though; in fact, most of them are
conventional IF puzzles, and many are quite clever. The result is a
somewhat schizophrenic but overall fairly enjoyable game that even
offers some food for thought.

It seems your Go teacher has mysteriously disappeared, but she's left
behind some clues. The clues lead to a sort of larger-than-life Go
board, which you have to navigate, by turns using your Go knowledge and
your common sense. The puzzles you encounter along the way are mostly
logical, with a few exceptions, and their structure blends symmetry and
asymmetry in a way appropriate for the underlying game of Go. If there
are problems, they're largely motivational: most of the puzzles are
premised on something akin to "here's some stuff to fiddle with, and if
you fiddle with it properly, you'll have something that will eventually
prove to be useful," rather than actual goal-driven reasoning. Still,
Not Just a Game has a lot of company in that respect, and it's hardly a
fatal flaw. There's also an interesting blend between
chinoiserie/Orientalism and Western culture, in that the bulk of the
puzzles that aren't directly related to Go could fit into your average
house-setting or fantasy game, and there are certain objects (e.g.,
chewing gum) that would seem a bit out of place if the game were really
striving to be culturally correct. In fact, the game itself calls
attention to this contrast--the initial room description puts a Go board
"between the sofa and the TV," and the description of a computer
mentions that your teacher "doesn't feel comfortable around
technological equipment." (Quick disclaimer: I'm not saying technology
is Western. Merely that late-twentieth-century stuff like computers
don't fit all that well into the chinoiserie setting, as exemplified by
<a href = "s.html#sound">Sound of One Hand Clapping</a>, or, for that matter, the endgame of Not
Just a Game.)

The aspect of the game that requires that you actually apply Go
knowledge in more than a superficial way isn't quite as successful,
unfortunately. It may be that Go just isn't easy to learn from a few
entries in a booklet, but the Go problems that appear at the end of the
game were difficult enough that I often didn't understand why the
correct solution was correct, even after I'd found it by trial and
error. This might be my mental block, but I'm not sure that applied
reasoning on this level, even if it's only to learn Go, is well suited
for IF--at least, barring a more thorough tutorial process than Not Just
a Game provides. The final puzzle, which essentially involves scoring a
completed Go game, is tedious in the extreme, moreover--once you figure
out the premise of Go scoring, which isn't all that complicated, it's a
matter of counting dots on a large grid. Whereas the other puzzles felt
obscure, this one just feels mindless--and the game would benefit
considerably, I think, if it were removed.

The writing is quite good--it's rarely especially evocative (the setting
is largely pretty unremarkable, after all), but it also rarely gets in
the way of the game, which takes some skill in itself. There's also some
humor scattered here and there, documented in an 'amusing' section.
There are likewise few technical flaws or game design problems: one
section involves a lot of traipsing around, which does get tiresome
after a while, but at least it's straightforward traipsing. The story
itself requires some disbelief-suspending, but no more than your average
fantasy game, to be fair--and the only reason that the suspensions of
disbelief here require a conscious effort is that the initial genre of
the game isn't clear from the outset, and the setting wanders back and
forth a bit between Western suburbs and, um, a vaguely Oriental setting.
That may be jarring initially, but it's also rather creative, and it
allows for some interesting juxtapositions. For instance, the "Five
Elements of Chinese Philosophy" can be found in a poster on a
refrigerator, and a baseball bat figures prominently in putting together
the Go-related materials. The picture that emerges is one of cultural
synthesis, in some respects: your teacher clearly is struggling to
retain her own values in an unfamiliar culture, and yet you--and she,
implicitly--are surrounded by the trappings of that culture, and draw on
them to achieve your ends. The cultures are more complementary than
conflicting, then--it's not a question of rejecting one in favor of the
other. (I must say, though, that the computer with Z-abuses on it was an
odd touch, even under a cultural-synthesis analysis.) In that light,
then, it's not necessary to believe uncritically that, as your teacher
says, Go is "a reflection of your inner self"--merely that there are
many for whom the game of Go really is that important, and that it's
worth examining the implications of those values.

As a game, then, Not Just a Game is quite solid, if hardly
extraordinary. The puzzles are good, and reasonably creative, but
nothing particularly remarkable, and the Go puzzles themselves don't
work particularly well. But among the subtexts are some rather unusual
IF themes, unusual enough to make this one of the more interesting
recent works of IF.

VERSION: Release 1.02

I downloaded this game from the ftp.ifarchive.org archive after seeing an
announcement on the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup and as soon as I read
the introduction I knew I was in for a real treat:

   It's Christmas Eve. Rather late on Christmas Eve. Just this afternoon
   your darling 7-year-old daughter Samantha announced that fully a week
   ago she mailed a letter to Santa Claus asking for Sugar Toes
   Ballerina, the unbelievably sought-after, impossible-to-find fad doll
   of the decade. Unwilling to see little Sam heartbroken on Christmas
   morning, you frantically phoned every toy store in town.
   Miraculously, you found a shop that claimed to have a Sugar Toes
   Ballerina in stock!

   But that was two hours ago -- before the flat tire. Now it's getting
   dark, and icy weather is closing in. The address you were given, on
   the outskirts of town, has proven to be that of a dilapidated and
   disreputable-looking shopping center -- not a modern chrome-and-neon
   strip mall, either, but a hulking two-story structure that looks to
   be the ill-favored offspring of a fairy castle and a canning factory.
   The shopping center is tucked well back from the street among
   brooding skeletal trees. Other than a few dim yellowish lights that
   show no trace of holiday spirit, the building is shrouded in gloom,
   and yours is the only car in the parking lot.

Although my own kids are grown up now (well, they think they are...) I can
well remember the fad toys that were always (and still are) hyped at
Christmas, and how kids are made to feel they are missing out if they
don't have one. So, with great nostalgia I embarked on my quest for the
Sugar Toes ballerina doll.

The first impressions are great. The dark, apparently deserted shopping
centre, hardly a sound anywhere, and freezing cold. Wandering around, I
found I couldn't get very far as seemingly the power was off, and my
hands were too cold to do very much. I found a security guard almost
immediately but fortunately for me he was sound asleep. Unfortunately
his elbow was leaning on a very interesting looking key and I couldn't
obtain it straight away as he kept waking up and frogmarching me out of
the building. However, there is a way to get hold of it and after much
messing about I managed to do that very thing, and then found I could
unlock most of the locked doors in the complex. However, that didn't
solve the problem of no power, therefore no lighting. One other problem
to over come initially was the series of security monitors covering the
entire centre from the office where the guard is. Eventually, after much
pulling out of hair, I did manage to disable them all and find a power
source, so was able to explore at leisure.

Perhaps leisure is not the right word here, as there are three floors to
the centre, plus the roof, so I found my map sprawling over several
pages. There are loads of shops and almost all of them have a unique
puzzle attached to them, which in turn relates to another puzzle
somewhere else. The difficulty level of the puzzles ranges from
easy/medium to oblique/!**! impossible. Well not quite impossible, but
some of the hardest I have come across in a very long while. A couple of
them put me in mind of Steve Clay's Taxman series some years ago, but
don't let that put you off. The game has an inbuilt gradual hint system
so if you find you're really stuck you can use that.

I have to say here that I am not sure I am in favour of the in-game hint
system, as it makes it too easy to cheat if you are weak-willed. I
managed to be very disciplined and only resorted to the hints three
times, and given the difficulty of the game, I was quite pleased with
myself.

On your quest you will come across such things as a depressed elf, a
homeless man, the security guard and a rather nasty, very large dog,
plus one or two others.

I have to say I haven't enjoyed a game as much in a very long time. It's
one of those that keep pulling you back for just one more try. On more
than one occasion I found myself looking at the clock to realise it was
past two in the morning, and that doesn't happen very often.

The writing is excellent, with very little in the way of errors. Of
course, you have to allow for the difference in spelling (eg tire
instead of tyre), but I have no quibble about that. The game runs
smoothly, and solving one puzzle seems to lead right into another
without any let up. I lost count of the number of objects to be found -
63 at the last count, and every one has at least one use. This will give
you some idea of the size and complexity of the game.

I haven't quite finished it yet. I have found Sugar Toes, but haven't
yet managed to pay for it (I'm very honest you see). This last puzzle
has me climbing the walls - I know what to do and I have the necessary
items (I think), but will have to put a lot of time and effort into
solving it. There appears to be no built in hints for this last one
(deliberate?) so I may well email the author and ask for help.....

To close I would say that this is an unmissable game, and you know me, I
don't say that very often.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag20.html">SPAG #20</a> -- March 15, 2000

There are inherent mimesis problems in most puzzle-fest IF, since most
of us do not live in a world where we need to solve logic problems or
math riddles to open doors. One of the most significant mimesis problems
is the objects-out-of-place syndrome--since most interesting puzzles
involve objects with unusual or striking properties, the game author
needs to come up with a good reason why the setting might include the
objects that are vital to her chosen puzzles. Jim Aikin's Not Just an
Ordinary Ballerina solves the problem in a rather creative way: the game
is set in a shopping mall. Not just any shopping mall, of course; this
one includes such things as a hair salon, a book bindery, and an antique
store, the better to craft puzzles with, my dear. What results is about
as unabashed a puzzle-fest as IF has ever seen--and while not all of the
puzzles are highlights, the result is still thoroughly enjoyable.

You're a parent (the game carefully avoids giving you a gender, though
given the limited NPC interaction, this isn't all that remarkable a
feat) searching for a doll on Christmas Eve, after the stores have
closed; your 7-year- old daughter has her heart set on one Sugar Toes,
and you're determined to find it. That's the premise, and it's a good
one, but in truth it hardly matters whether you're after a ballerina
doll or the Magic Hair Dryer of the Gods, since you can largely forget
about your ostensible purpose until the very end. NJAOB is an old-style
game: the puzzles are, I think it's safe to say, the raison d'etre, and
your daughter and the doll provide a reasonably plausible framing device
but not much more. (Perhaps that's not fair--some of the crueler
obstacles you overcome could be taken as a wry comment on Christmas
shopping and the primitive instincts it brings out in parents who are
intent on keeping their kids up with the latest craze--but the game
doesn't really do anything with that particular angle.) The result is
distinctly reminiscent of Infocom's golden years in several respects;
there's an initial premise, and the player is told to go forth and solve
puzzles, most of which have no obvious connection to the ultimate goal,
in hopes that things will work out in the end. On its terms, it works
well--but as the trend in recent IF has been toward the integration of
story and puzzles, NJAOB feels like something of a throwback.

The puzzles--well, thereby hang quite a few tales. Most are quite
clever; indeed, even those that are familiar in certain respects have
original twists that help liven up the proceedings. There are some
regrettable inclusions, in particular a fifteen puzzle--with a twist, to
be sure, but it's still a fifteen puzzle in mechanics, and I dearly
wished for a way to skip it--and several mazes, all of which have a
twist of some sort, of course, but they're firmly within the maze
category. Several are math-based, one (one of the first puzzles in the
game) in a rather obscure way--and while some are straightforward,
others come perilously close to read-the-author's-mind. On the other
hand, most of the puzzles have a certain elegance--none, with the
exception of a certain logic puzzle, are needlessly complicated--and a
few require rather subtle lateral thinking. The layout of the game is
distinctly "wide"--after the player solves the first few puzzles, dozens
more are suddenly available all at once, so there are multiple
puzzle-solving avenues to explore for most of the game. As with most
"wide" games, however, there's an inherent frustration element--there
may be many puzzles to solve, but it's distinctly possible (particularly
toward the later stages of the game) that only one or two will be
solvable at any particular moment, meaning that you may not have the
tools to solve the problem you're currently struggling with. There's an
in-game hint system that adapts nicely to your progress in the game,
however, and which informs you if you're not yet ready to tackle a
puzzle, so that's a saving grace. There's even one puzzle that depends
on ASCII-art renderings for description-- and while the ASCII art is
competently done, it feels like something of a betrayal to have largely
textual IF give up on text at a key point. Moreover, as with many
puzzle-fest games, the puzzles work only if you don't think about them
too much--the technicians who set up the power and security systems for
this shopping mall were either math Ph.D's or Games Magazine editors.

Puzzle-fest IF has an inherent drawback that Ballerina addresses but
doesn't entirely overcome. The problem is that the game can feel like a
long slog, a series of Mensa-type puzzles without much in the way of
reward along the way; if the story doesn't go anywhere when the player
solves puzzles, and the only payoff is an object that's presumably
useful for another puzzle somewhere, the whole exercise can turn
wearisome after a while. Ballerina tries to overcome this in a rather
unusual fashion: there's a subplot of sorts that periodically intrudes
on the puzzle-solving in rather unexpected ways, so that now and again
you're rewarded with some interesting and particularly well-described
events that give your quest--well, not context as such, but something of
a contrast. The subplot doesn't really withstand close scrutiny--the
hows and whys are never resolved, or even touched, and some of the
puzzle-solving associated with it owes more to whimsy than to sense--and
yet it improves the game immeasurably, somehow; the incursion of the
unexpected (and fantastic) leaves the player feeling like she's
experienced something more than a doll-hunt. Suffice it to say that the
story element lends the game a touch of wonder--and considering that the
premise effectively requires breaking and entering on a grand scale,
wonder is exactly what's needed here.

The setting is vividly rendered, though the talents of a writer as
gifted as this one aren't likely to be appreciated in this sort of game:
there are few notable events with which to capture the player's
imagination, and even the most skillful of room descriptions gets old
after a hundred readings or so. The tone of the descriptions varies from
sparing...

   The heavy structure of the shopping center stretches left and right
   from here. When you crane your neck the building seems almost to be
   leaning outward, as if it's in some danger of collapsing on top of
   you, or perhaps pouncing on you. Doubtless that's only a trick of the
   light. An arched entryway beckons to the south, above it the
   inscription 

           FLOGG & GRABBY'S STUFFTOWN 
                    EST. 1974 

   carved in a pigeon-flecked substance that looks more like plaster
   than real stone. Running along the building above the arch is a
   covered-over exterior walkway. 

...to faintly silly:

   You've never seen so many lamps in your life. Floor lamps, table
   lamps, gooseneck lamps, chandeliers, porch lights, track lighting --
   when God said, "Let there be light," whoever owns this shop said, "I
   can make a buck on that." The only exit is the door to the lower
   concourse on the east.

The feel of a slightly seedy shopping mall is well conveyed, for example
in the "pigeon-flecked substance" in the first description quoted above,
and to the extent that the game has an overall tone, the tawdriness fits
it well. Less well developed or apt is the eerie aspect, brought out in
the "pouncing" bit here and in various references to shadows and gloom
elsewhere; the writing is more than good enough to set a creepy scene,
of course, but the tawdry-glitzy aspect and frequent lapses into
goofiness (the above is hardly the only silly bit) undermine the effort.
Again, though, given that the puzzles rather than the setting and story
are the focus of attention here, it's hardly a major drawback. The
overall feel of playing Ballerina is hard to convey concisely; there's a
temptation to simply ignore the setting and view the game as a set of
puzzles, given the number and variety of those puzzles. Most players are
likely to initially absorb the well-described setting, but increasingly
disregard it as they start tackling the puzzles, and the extent to which
the tone and style of the game stays with the player consequently
varies.

Technically, everything works well here--admirably well, considering the
size (a 500K-plus Z8 file) of the game and the vast numbers of objects.
The rucksack stand-in, appropriately enough a shopping bag, isn't
flawless--I spent more time than I wanted to fiddling with it, and the
game doesn't provide for things like automatically taking a key out of
the bag in order to unlock a door. The same problem recurs elsewhere;
several places where modern-day IF veterans might expect the game to
supply inferences don't make such inferences, which can be frustrating.
Still, it's good enough, and most of the glitches I noticed were minor
details rather than game-stoppers. The hint system is quite well
done--the adaptive aspect worked perfectly--and several puzzles have
reasonably logical alternative solutions.

If Ballerina suffers as a game-playing experience, then, it's less
because it doesn't succeed in what it set out to do than because its
genre isn't in critical vogue these days, if a field as sparse as IF
criticism can be said to have a vogue. The PC is largely a cipher, the
story intermittent and largely without momentum, the NPCs fairly
cardboard--in short, the game exists largely for the sake of the
puzzles, rather than trying to create an immersive experience through
the story. It's far more difficult--virtually impossible, even--to make
a puzzle-centered game immersive in the same way, and in that Ballerina
occasionally requires that the player draw on outside knowledge of one
form or another, it doesn't really try for immersion as such. The
expectations of IF players in this day and age have been shaped by so
many moral ambiguities, unreliable narrators, branching plots, and the
like that the puzzle-oriented nature of Ballerina may prove
unsatisfying.

On the whole, then, Ballerina fits its genre admirably, and the player
who doesn't ask it to be more than a puzzle-fest will not be
disappointed. The puzzles are difficult, but largely fair, and they
boast a wealth of originality. It has some minor flaws, but it's worth
checking out.

Nothing More, Nothing Less (NMNL) was a late entry to the 2001
SmoochieComp by a first-time author who, in his own words, "used the
SmoochieComp as an excuse to learn an IF language", so as you might
expect there were some first time growing pains and perhaps a few
awkward game design choices, and I hope that the author takes the
following review as the constructive criticism that it is intended to
be. To his credit, the author attempts a few novel game design
initiatives and that's what I'll be focusing on for the first part of
this review.

NMNL is a fairly small game that takes place in the protagonist's (and
most likely the author's) small apartment, with the usual rooms (i.e.,
bedroom, bathroom, living room) accounted for. There is no use of
cardinal directions in the game. Movement through the apartment is
simply done through the typing in of room titles. I found this fairly
easy to get used to, even though I've grown accustomed to mapping out a
landscape in my head with the use of cardinal directions. The room
descriptions are fairly succinct, describing the basic necessities of
life that surround the PC and his girlfriend, but room descriptions
change depending on what challenge the PC is facing. No doubt, this is
an attempt by the author to clue the player in to a certain problem by
bringing current dilemmas to the foreground of the player's perception.
For example, during a section of the game involving the PC's
girlfriend's cat, the living room changes from this:

   Living Room
   This is the part of the apartment in which I spend most of my waking
   hours. This is due to three important pieces of furniture here: the
   large oak desk that holds my much-used computer; the TV, favorite
   appliance of my beloved after a long day a work; and the futon which
   we both like to cuddle upon.

TO

   Living Room
   This is the place where my girlfriend's evil cat sleeps... when it's
   the least convenient, of course. From here, I can reach the kitchen,
   the dining room, and the hallway.

Not a big deal, right? Except, there's no longer any mention of the TV,
computer or futon; all objects which are still in scope but aren't
described in the room's current description. In certain rooms, you have
to manipulate some of these "hidden" objects to boot. When I ran into
the repeated problem of trying to remember what had been in each room
the only remedy was to save my position, restart the game, get a good
look at what was in each room, then use that prior knowledge during my
saved game. Thankfully, the game was only a few rooms big so the saving
and restoring wasn't too overwhelming. Still, it was probably more
trouble than it should've been. 

Another interesting game design choice involved progressively revealing
items of importance throughout the course of the game. So, for example,
a cursory look in a certain room may not reveal much of interest the
first time around, but another look a few turns later may reveal
something new and useful. Other reviewers of NMNL have enjoyed this
feature, but I found it kind of tedious. I'm of the opinion that if
something's in scope at the beginning of the game and hasn't been
manipulated somehow then it should always be in scope. What ended up
happening when I faced a challenge was that I'd just type in each room
name, take a look around, and mysteriously bump into what I needed.
Again not a big deal, but from a playing experience I could effectively
turn my brain off until I stumbled into what I needed and as a result,
it wasn't as much fun as it might have been.

The game's focus was unfortunately a little off-kilter, too, for what is
an extremely linear game. When the intro tells me my goal is to bring in
a photo receipt (which incidentally, is the ultimate goal of NMNL),
that's generally what I'm aiming to do, but every time I tried to exit
my apartment the game would come back with an, "Oh, wait you forgot to
do <insert apartment related chore here>". This again isn't a big deal
but perhaps a smoother game design would have had one puzzle finishing
then linking to the beginning of another puzzle, as opposed to
segregating them.

There is also a novel hint system included which spirits you away to a
car being driven by the author and his girlfriend where you can ask or
tell the author about a subject and get responses. Unfortunately the
responses aren't terribly helpful; more descriptions about objects than
a nudge in right direction. The hint system actually serves more as a
backdrop for some banter between the author and his girlfriend where we
learn about the author's experience concerning the city he lives in,
participation in the IF community, and other more menial activities.
Inadvertently most likely, the author also designed the hint system so
that I, for the life of me, couldn't find my way out of it. Typing in
random words finally got me to 'PLAY', which kicked me back into the
game.

So, to sum up so far: Some interesting game design choices, some of
which were not overwhelming successes but most of which I'd certainly
applaud as a good attempt at something novel. Outside of the game's
infrastructure though, how does the game stack up in the prose and plot
department? Well before I address those areas, I'd like to do something
they taught us never to do back in IF Review school: I would like to
discuss the author as opposed to the game and to start off, I'd like to
make the assumption that you the protagonist are in fact the author.
Where does this assumption come from? Well number one, all the responses
are cast in the first person as opposed to the second and two, the
familiar tone of the work when the author describes his surrounding
would indicate to me that he's talking about himself. 

If this assumption was in fact the author's intent, then I think it's
also fair to say that the author is pretty crazy about his girlfriend.
The initial indications come from the banter between the author and his
girlfriend during the hint system piece but the real proof comes from
the fact that almost every object description is framed by how it
relates to her. For example, look at the following: 

   >examine bed
   It's a big a comfy bed, with plenty of space for us both. Even if my
   beloved wasn't living here when I bought it, I thought I should play
   safe... and I was right. She moves a lot during her sleep, you know?
   (Well, come to think of it, I don't think I want you to know.)

OR

   >examine sink
   I basically need to use this sink for four things: washing my teeth,
   combing my hair, washing my hands and... oh, make that three things.
   I used to shave daily, but in the recent weeks my beloved has taken a
   fancy to the bearded look, and I have been willing to oblige her.

Boy that's sweet; sugary, feeling-it-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach sweet.
Which of course is completely acceptable for a SmoochieComp game, but
would get to be a bit much for me personally were it just a normal
non-thematically based release. The game is so sweet in fact, that it
reads to me more like a homage to the author's girlfriend with the plot
and puzzles added after the fact as simple window dressing. There is of
course absolutely nothing wrong with that, but the personal nature of
the piece may not be to everybody's taste. Now to really go out on a
limb, considering the release date for the SmoochieComp games (February
14th), I think it may also be the case that this platform experiment
turned out to be a pretty nice valentine for someone special.

It could also be the case that I'm assuming way too much and we all know
that when people assume: they make an 'ass' out of 'u' and 'me', so
maybe I should stop before I get myself into too much trouble. To wrap
up then: NMNL as far as a piece of first-time IF and platform experiment
is pretty average and pretty much what I'd expect, to be honest, but as
a publicly accessible piece that expresses love for someone special
(which I believe, perhaps incorrectly, NMNL to be) NMNL is mostly a
success, and one a few of us could probably take some lessons from.
