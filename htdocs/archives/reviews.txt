Hi, folks...

SPAG Issue #50 is drawing near.  I don't have any great celebrations planned for this milestone, but I do have a couple of very nice features already in the hopper.  What I don't have, though, is reviews.  That's where I was hoping you might help me out.

This issue will be coming out just AFTER the Competition concludes, which means the Comp games will be fair game.  If you have something to say about anything you played this year, or feel the urge to flesh out some of your capsule reviews into longer pieces, please think about submitting your work to SPAG.

There are also lots and lots of games from earlier this year needing attention.  Here's a list to give you some ideas:

Suburst Contamination
Spring Thing 2007 games (any, some, or all)
Adventurer Consumer's Guide
IF Art Show 2007 games (any, some, or all)
Lovecraft Commonplace Book Project games (any, some, or all)
Blighted Isle
Ghost Town: The Lost Treasure
IntroComp 2007 games (any, some, or all)
Crystal and Stone and Beetle and Bone
Lydia's Heart
Weishaupt Scholars
The Beast of Torrack Moor (Inform 7 version)

There's been a lot of activity this year, and SPAG is way behind in keeping track of it.  Please think about helping out.

The deadline for submissions will be November 20, 2007.
