  NAME: A Fable                                   PARSER: Poor
  AUTHOR: Stan Heller                             PLOT: I couldn't find one
  EMAIL: Unknown                                  ATMOSPHERE: Kafka-esque
  AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF Archive                     WRITING: Reasonable
  PUZZLES: Virtually nonexistant                  SUPPORTS: AGT
  CHARACTERS: Non-interactive                     DIFFICULTY: Couldn't say

Well, what can I say?  In _A Fable_, a game originally written in 1985 by one
Stan Heller, and apparently rewritten three years ago by David Malmberg and
Mark Welch with AGT 1.35, you guide the actions of Max, a somewhat confused
man.  Unlike most IF _A Fable_ uses the third person (ie, `Max feels suddenly
like a huge cloud has lifted him up and taken him away').  This adds to the
detached, dreamlike atmosphere which the author has attempted to create.  The
introduction tells how Max has gone for an evening stroll through his
neighbourhood in order to `find himself'. Wrapped in self-obsession he is
unaware as his world rapidly disappears, and Max soon finds himself in a
strange place, enveloped in fog.

Apart from a few foggy areas each location (there are apparently only fifteen
so the game is mercifully short) is a one or two paragraph scene reminiscent
in style, but without the content, of some of Kafka's shortest works.  They
are apparently unrelated to each other, except that each seems as pointless
and pretentious as the other.  In most of these locations there is one item
which you can manipulate, but to what end I could not say.

The only puzzle which I could find (and I quit with a score of 70/75)
involved unlocking a lock with a key...  Wow!  Admittedly the key was hidden,
but very obviously.  The score seems to go up for no reason (maybe for moving
to a new location) and also goes down for no reason.

I guess Max is wandering around his own mind and each location is meant to
reveal something to him about himself, but if this is the case it hasn't
worked. Oh, this is silly.  Even four paragraphs is too long a review for
this.  Unless I have missed something crucial this game is utter drivel. 
Don't bother.

TITLE: Fa&#231;ade
AUTHOR: Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern
EMAIL: feedback SP@G interactivestory.net
DATE: July 2005
PARSER: Custom
SUPPORTS: Windows, >= 1.6 GHz, >= 256MB RAM, OpenGL
AVAILABILITY: <a href = "http://www.interactivestory.net/download/">http://www.interactivestory.net/download/</a>
URL: <a href = "http://www.interactivestory.net/">http://www.interactivestory.net/</a>
VERSION: 1.0

Not another one-room game set in an apartment!

Well, actually, you probably couldn't call Fa&#231;ade a game in the typical
sense -- even though a pre-release version was a finalist in the 2004
Independent Games Festival, and the New York Times called the system
"the future of video games." Fa&#231;ade may or may not even be IF, for that
matter. But it's clearly something closely related to it, and whether
you're willing to award it the IF label or not, there are good reasons
that a lot of people -- myself included -- think that Fa&#231;ade is a
tremendous advance in interactive storytelling.

This "one act interactive drama" is the outcome of a research project
that has spanned more than five years, one that you can read more about
in the two creators' dozen-odd academic papers and in Mateas's
dissertation, done as the last publication of the Carnegie Mellon
University Oz Project. Fa&#231;ade is not just good research, though. It can
provide an intense, compelling experience, even though a session can be
played in about fifteen minutes.

When you download and fire up the system, you'll get to visit with your
old friends Trip and Grace -- 3D illustrated characters whose statements
have all been recorded by voice actors -- as their marriage falls apart.
You'll be able to type short statements to converse with them, move
around the room using the arrow keys, and use the mouse to manipulate
objects. Fa&#231;ade lacks adventuring, a clear way to win, and the typical
IF command structure -- if you type "PICK UP THE MAGIC EIGHT BALL"
you'll be saying that to Trip or Grace, not instructing your character
in what to do. You can manipulate objects, however, and can say whatever
short statements you like to the two other characters. If you manage to
keep your comments fairly relevant to the conversation, or apartment, or
situation, the two are likely to react appropriately, both in an
immediate sense and in terms of the overall development of the
conversation and the drama.

Before getting deeper into why Fa&#231;ade is so great, I'll mention that the
two authors and developers, Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern, do happen
to be my good friends and fellow bloggers with me at Grand Text Auto,
where I made the official announcement of the release of Fa&#231;ade. So, you
may choose to take my evaluation of the system with a grain of salt. But
then, if no one reviewed interactive fiction by people they knew, there
would be a lot less reviewing going on.

I'll also mention a few other things by way of preface: Fa&#231;ade is a
working prototype, one quite capable of providing a powerful experience
that is both interactive (in a meaningful way) and dramatic (in the
tradition of drama, going back to Aristotle). But it's also capable of
breaking. Trip and Grace can fall eerily, permanently silent and remain
planted in the same spot. You can get stuck walking in the door. Things
that you type can be interpreted by the system in what seems to be
exactly the wrong way. As is the case with interactive fiction, you have
to learn something about how to interact fruitfully before you can
interact fruitfully. Trying to play along, and not getting it quite
right, can lead to frustration. Fa&#231;ade's excellence is not that it has
some sort of dramatic Turing-Test-like ability to handle everything you
can throw at it; there are plenty of ways to run aground, even when
you're not trying to.

The thing about Fa&#231;ade, though, is that when things go right, which
isn't all that difficult to achieve, they can go brilliantly right. Your
conversation can take you in an exhilarating free ride over the Freytag
diagram of Trip and Grace's soul-searching and their coming to terms
with their relationship, a ride that is not just funny, but manages to
be touching. And, it's a ride that you get to steer: once a good typist
is keyed into the way to talk to Trip and Grace, he or she can provoke
reactions, draw the conversation to different topics, side with one or
the other character, and nudge the drama in different directions. Grace
and Trip are not stateless Elizas; they are closer, if anything, to
<a href = "g.html#galatea">Galateas</a>, but they also maintain an awareness of the way the
conversation has progressed so far, and they work together to achieve
dramatic goals, and they use a complex behavior control system to blend
their high-level and low-level actions together smoothly.

The Oz Project at CMU, the major academic effort in interactive drama so
far, sought to develop systems that were "highly interactive," that is,
ones that allowed the player to move, talk, and act at any point, rather
than only at the end of a turn. Fa&#231;ade realizes this goal, among others.
Grace and Trip react fluidly to comments from the player at any point,
given the somewhat asymmetric typed text interface. They player is
always free to move around and check out things in the apartment. The
system structures events beginning at the level of the dramatic beat (a
visible action and reaction) and allows the player to intervene between
beats or to interrupt a beat.

Fa&#231;ade is also impressive in how it deals with language. It is able to
understand many statements that are relevant to the current situation,
and to correctly handle jokes, praise, agreement, disagreement,
flirting, rudeness, and so on. Not that every possible statement is
always correctly classified and acted upon, of course. But the natural
language understanding system works well enough, enough of the time, for
the drama at hand. Again, the amazing thing isn't that this system is
flawless. It's that players can manage to get through an entire act
without a noticeable slip-up -- even though this framework for
interaction, unlike the venerable ">" prompt in IF, has few precedents,
and players can't build on their previous knowledge of how to interact.
It's as if you found someone who had never played interactive fiction
before, sat this person down at a new version of <a href = "a.html#advent">Adventure</a>, and found
that after a few minutes of typing the game understood practically all
the input it was getting and the newcomer was having a great time.

While Fa&#231;ade looks more like a graphical adventure or a strange
first-person shooter than like most text-based IF pieces, the insights
that Mateas and Stern have gained in working on the system can certainly
trickle into more traditional IF. It's not the place of a review to
start outlining all the ways in which they might do that, but I will
note that Mateas, with his student Mark Nelson, has already looked into
how some of the techniques employed in Fa&#231;ade can be used in the context
of an existing interactive fiction. Those two discuss this topic in a
paper presented at the Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital
Entertainment conference, "Search-based Drama Management in the
Interactive Fiction <a href = "a.html#anchor">Anchorhead</a>."

Currently Fa&#231;ade only runs on Windows XP, 2000 or ME. It's pretty
processor intensive, and will refuse to run on processors slower than
1.6 GHz. It's also an 800 MB download via BitTorrent. (You can spend $14
plus shipping to get Fa&#231;ade on two CDs, which Mateas and Stern sell at
cost.) If you're an IF fan with an adequate Windows machine, it's
certainly worth the download time or CD cost. I had to ask around my
department for a while to find a suitable computer to borrow for Fa&#231;ade
installation and play, so I envy those who only have to wait for the
download to finish. A Mac version is planned, and will happen whenever
the two developers (hopefully with some volunteer help) can manage the
port, but it isn't imminent. In the meantime, if you're lucky enough to
have a system on hand that will run Fa&#231;ade, check it out! I'd venture to
guess that it will be the most impressive one-room game in an apartment
that you'll play all year.

NAME: FailSafe
AUTHOR: Jon Ingold

PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-machine interpreters

VERSION: 1? (no version info shown and version command ignored)

This is possibly the strangest piece of IF I've ever encountered. It's
fairly short -- in fact, I think even the slowest person could complete
it in 30 minutes. The story is confusing. So far as I can tell, you are
at a base or something. You get a distress call on an emergency
frequency and you have to respond. It seems that a small space pod has
been attacked and there is only one survivor who is trying to fix the
engines before the ship crashes. To make matters worse, there is a war
going on and the enemy is massing for an attack. That's really all I can
tell without giving the end away, although really, that's all I'm sure
of. The ending is sure to be a surprise, and there are at least three
different endings that I am aware of. It's hard to tell if you've won or
lost, you just completed the story. The other odd thing is that all of
the standard meta commands (score, save, script, version, etc.) are
disabled. I think the author is trying to provide tension by making you
feel that you don't have much time and you can't save in real life.
However, he could have at least left scripting enabled so that it would
be easy to provide a transcript of something. The only way you could do
this now is to copy and paste.

As for the writing itself, it is intentionally choppy. The idea is that
the signal is really poor, almost inaudible in fact. If you type an
invalid command, the response is to the effect that the other person
can't hear you due to the static. Here is a sample to give a taste of
this game. This is actually what you get after the opening credits.

   Bzzt. Crackle. *Static*

   "...hello? Hello? Can... me? .. Anyone! Hel.... Need.. hello?"

   Bleep - PLEASE WAIT - Locating/Tuning signal...

   ..

   ".. help. Repeat, can anybody hear me? Can you hear me? Hello.."


    >>yes 
   "Hello? Hello! The .. <crackle> pretty bad. Are you receiving this?
   Over."

    >>yes
   "Oh, thank God. Thank God.. ..emergency frequency.. We need help.
   This is the space pod 'Serpentine'. We've been attacked, a small
   cruiser. They.. they came out of nowhere.. tried to board us..
   ...stly dead.. systems are all messed up, we're drifting.. I need
   help to fix this.."

   "I'm by the console, there's wires everywhere. The computer flashing
   something. What do I do? Hello?"

Note the double prompt. This makes it obvious from the start that
this isn't your traditional game. A poster on rec.games.int-fiction
called this game "<a href = "s.html#suspended">Suspended</a> for dummies," but I don't see it that
way. The only similarity to Suspended that I could see is the fact
that you are dropped into the middle of a disaster without much
warning. I really don't think there's anything like this in
existence. It's certainly a unique way to tell a story, but I am not
sure if I like it or not. Perhaps if the multiple endings were a bit
more descriptive, but they continue the choppy nature of the
beginning with multiple signals being received in some cases. The
bottom line is that people who like to fill in stories from bits and
pieces will probably like this particular game more than those who,
like me, enjoy a rich, detailed world.

The "narrative at war with a crossword" that describes most IF
games--the competing demands of plot and puzzles, and the attempt to
accommodate both without sacrificing either--is actually, as many have
noted, a stand-in for a more fundamental question: how to involve the
player in the story the author wants to tell while still telling that
particular story? The answer is usually "with puzzles that don't detract
from the structure/pacing/logic of the plot," but not always--it's
possible to get the player involved in a story by means other than
puzzles. Jon Ingold's FailSafe is a might-have-been in this
respect--it's a story that could, I think, have stood on its own, and
which is hindered more than helped by the puzzles it includes.

The protagonist is the only one alive on a spaceship which has taken a
beating after a battle with an alien ship, and is radioing to you, the
player, for help. Specifically, the protagonist wants you to help him
get the ship back in order before the next attack comes along. The
signal isn't very good, though, and the protagonist is less than fully
coherent, so ascertaining what's going on (or has gone on) secondhand is
something of a challenge. (Particularly because all of the standard
system commands--QUIT, SAVE, UNDO, the whole lot of them) are
disabled--the better to reproduce the sense of actually communicating
with someone, of course.) It's an interesting challenge,
though--reconstructing past events (for purposes of gaining insight into
a present situation) is an underused and potentially fruitful IF
technique.

As it happens, though, that's not the focus of what goes on here--there
are a few puzzles, and then you reach one of a variety of endings. The
puzzles aren't especially good; one amounts to trial and error (made all
the more irritating by the absence of UNDO), and another is hindered by
some thoroughly unhelpful syntax. (Yes, admittedly, a person is not a
parser, and it's not entirely realistic to expect a person's
comprehension to work the same way as a parser, but guess-the-syntax is
guess-the-syntax.) The endings are good--thought-provoking and well
worth reaching--but the puzzles, to my mind, don't fit.

Here, it seems, you have a premise that makes the interactive hook, in
the form of puzzles, largely unnecessary. The *game* is a puzzle in
itself; you' re trying to figure out what exactly happened, and you're
battling the protagonist's vagueness and confusion and the chaos
inherent in a partly wrecked ship. The nasty/strange/welcome surprises
that you come across should be able to tell the story and keep the
player involved all by themselves, particularly when the game is this
small. (Well, okay, it would probably have to be a little larger if
there were no puzzles.) There's also room for more story development in
the distance between player and protagonist: do they trust each other?
What do each of them know that the other doesn't? (FailSafe does hit
that angle at one point, but there's more that could be done with it.)

Unnecessary puzzles aside, though, FailSafe has its moments. One
particularly effective touch is a series of messages that the player
receives from a computer analyzing what's happened and who was aboard
the damaged ship, messages that the protagonist doesn't receive; the
juxtaposition between the player's semicoherent account and the
computer's records is occasionally chilling. The inadequate descriptions
are part of what makes the game compelling--when several turns of static
pass before the protagonist's voice returns, there's genuine suspense.
There are also some nicely done red herrings--while there isn't as much
exploration potential as there might be, there's enough to keep the game
from feeling like a small set of puzzles. And the endings are genuinely
surprising (though spoiled somewhat by the game's XYZZY award
nomination; don't read the nominee list before you play the game), and
force the player to rethink what's come before.

FailSafe's small size works against it, I found--there's too little
there for the player to be really pulled up short by any surprising
turns. (The player doesn't spend long enough interacting with the
protagonist, and getting a mental picture of the story, to be truly
caught off guard by unexpected events; the assumptions and mental
pictures aren't around long enough to cause much surprise when they're
challenged or disproved.) Still, it's got an intriguing premise and it's
creatively done, and its spin on the player-PC relationship makes it a
must-play for IF theorists.

TITLE: Fallacy of Dawn

VERSION: 1.02

One of the more interesting products of the revolution that has taken
place in IF over the past few years is Robb Sherwin. Okay, technically,
Robb (presumably) preexisted the revolution, but the style of his games
didn't, to my knowledge, and somehow I can't see anything he has written
getting created in 1996. What do I mean? Simply, Robb pretty clearly
doesn't write his game for the puzzles, and players familiar with Robb,
I'm guessing, don't play them for the puzzles either; rather, it's the
writing -- the setting, the dialogue, the turns of phrase that he
scatters around -- that makes his games worth playing, and everything
else is an afterthought at best. Fallacy of Dawn, Robb's latest and
longest, devotes more attention to puzzles than had his previous efforts
(<a href = "c.html#chicks">Chicks Dig Jerks</a> and Crimson Spring), but the effect is still much the
same.

What's going on in Fallacy of Dawn? Well, it seems you live in a
dystopian city gone even worse and work in a retro video arcade -- your
life's passion appears to be '80s video games -- but you've been the
victim of a mugging that's left you with brain damage of sorts, and you
really need to scrape up cash for surgery. From there, the story careers
wildly here and there for a while, without much intervention from you;
your character has a habit of making important decisions during
noninteractive sequences. The upshot, however, is that you eventually
find yourself with two companions and a weapon, ready to accumulate some
money by any means necessary...

...and that's where things pretty much stop, plot-wise, for most of the
game. As in, you wander around performing random tasks that give you
money, and eventually you have enough, and the plot picks up again. The
middle section is more than half of the game, however, and it amounts to
a long meander. Worse, it's easy to run out of things to do and end up
wandering hither and yon asking for spare change. Not literally, but
close enough; it's not exactly interesting stuff. In that respect,
Fallacy of Dawn is a step back from Crimson Spring -- there's more to
the plot here than there was there, but there at least the plot kept
moving rather than going nowhere for most of the game. It's not even
accurate to call the digression a segue into puzzle IF rather than plot
IF, as there aren't really any puzzles to speak of; the gameplay usually
amounts to doing something extremely obvious, or following someone's
instructions very closely, in order to earn money (or, alternatively,
engaging in randomized combat, which hasn't been anyone's idea of a good
IF puzzle since 1982). Nor, even, is there character development to
speak of in this section -- your two companions tag along and say very
little. The raison d'etre, as far as I can tell, is to force you to
experience the setting in all its grimy glory, and that it does, ad
nauseam. But as gameplay, this is roughly on the level of a Towers of
Hanoi puzzle.

There are more problems. I mentioned above that Fallacy of Dawn devotes
more attention to puzzles than did Robb's previous games, but by that I
mean "has more of them," not "has more creative ones." There's the
puzzle where a vital item is under one of a whole bunch of objects, but
of course you have no way of knowing which one, nor even that anything
is under anything. (There's one thoroughly oblique hint, as far as I can
tell, but that's it.) There's the puzzle that you solve by doing
something over and over again, causing a certain NPC to (for reasons
that aren't wholly clear) act like a loon. There's the puzzle that you
solve when you're entirely incapacitated because the game, for no
particular reason, lets you do one thing. There are the "puzzles" that
amount to "try randomized combat, then try it again until you happen to
kill the bad guy." And don't even get me started on the ending sequence,
which requires insanely exact syntax under a tight time limit.

Nor are the problems only design-related. There's more unimplemented
scenery in Fallacy of Dawn than you can shake a stick at, and fewer
synonyms than you can, um, fail to shake a stick at. The graphics
regularly encroach on the text, and the gauges that are supposed to
represent your health and your need for a drug fix (really) are
represented by some strange high-ASCII characters. Toward the end, the
game appears to forget about compass directions and require an awful lot
of ENTER DOOR and such, for no discernible reason. And it's pretty easy
to run out of things to say (via conversation menus) to the various
NPCs, even when they really should have more on their minds; to some
extent, I suppose, that's par for the course with menus, but when, for
example, you have a romantic interlude -- at least, I think that's what
it was supposed to be -- you really should be able to say more than one
or two things.

But the writing -- ah, the writing. It's probably fair to say that
Robb's writing is an acquired taste, and it's not one that I've wholly
acquired -- the gore, for example, is just a tad too lovingly described
-- but I like it enough that I stick around to the end of a game that
doesn't have much more to offer than good writing. (Well, okay, there's
a plot, and outside sources had given me reason to believe that the
story would start up again eventually, but I doubt that would have been
enough.) Bizarre digressions abound -- this one, for instance, from the
opening text, in the middle of the description of the attack:

   It wasn't a very good showing for either my face or my TLA, in fact
   it brought my knowledge of Vegas handicapping factoids up to two: you
   always bet against the Bills in the Super Bowl, and you always take a
   vapourizer and a pair of fists against my face and my personal
   property. Even if you're getting the points, natch.

Funny one-liners abound (when you realized you failed to follow up on a
romantic opportunity, "How on earth did I mess this up? I need to stop
leaving the house without a personal social calendar assistant"), as do
memorable images (apartments in a certain complex "feel, when you're in
them, as well-crafted and sturdy as a margarine-slathered house of
playing cards"). And it's not a matter of an occasional humorous tidbit
-- there are amusing or memorably loopy lines in virtually every
paragraph. (Pizza that's getting cold "has a half-life of skittish
californium.") Fallacy of Dawn won its Best Writing XYZZY for a reason;
with a less skilled writer at the controls, this would be a fourth-rate
game, and I probably wouldn't have given it more than ten minutes.

As it is, well, it's worth experiencing, though I found myself wishing
for a text-dump utility more than once. The plot is second-rate sci-fi
at best, but even second-rate sci-fi is worth playing along with if it's
memorably written. I can't imagine what sort of IF Robb would write if
he turned his attention to some of the basic principles of game design,
and I wouldn't say that his writing makes up for every sin -- I wouldn't
recommend Chicks Dig Jerks to anyone. As much as Fallacy of Dawn does
wrong, however, I can't in good conscience refuse to give it a chuckle
and a thumbs-up.

VERSION: Release 1

To some, changing fate is a contradiction in terms. Victor Gijsber's Spring 
Thing winner Fate disagrees, as can be surmised before the player so much as 
presses a key:

"Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings."
-- Cassius to Brutus in 'Julius Caesar', Act I, Scene 2

Fate is about one woman trying to change an unhappy future. The protagonist and 
player-character, Catherine, is a young queen hours away from giving birth.

Oh, and she also has a crystal ball that's fortelling her son's untimely demise.

The objective here is to prevent said demise -- and Catherine has an arsenal of 
spells to do so. Spells are cast by the gathering of components as directed by 
the grimoire (spell book) found early in the game. It is by using these spells 
in creative ways that Catherine is able to alter fate, and it is the gathering 
and using of components that makes up the bulk of the game's puzzles. These 
puzzles are very fair while remaining fun; for those who do get stuck, however, 
A well implemented context-sensitive hint system is in place.

Despite the lack of a set time limit, a sense of urgency is created by the 
impending birth of Catherine's son. The player is periodically reminded that 
Catherine is very pregnant, often by painful descriptions. This sense of urgency 
blurs some of the moral and personal decisions Catherine must make in order to 
change her sons fate. Not wanting to spoil anything, I'll just say that some of 
these moral dilemmas are quite effective at disturbing a player who feels 
complicit to the wrongdoing.

There are several possible endings to this game, each depending on how far 
Catherine is willing to go for her unborn son. When the player is satisfied with 
the fate the crystal ball presents she can wait in her den and birth the child. 
The game refrains from explicitly pointing out whether an ending is winning or 
losing, leaving that to the player to decide and discover which is best. The 
result makes for a solid game with a number of endings to discover.

For all the game's strengths this piece has, one weakness that stands out is the 
use of a menu-driven conversation system for NPCs. While there are certainly 
examples of this system being used successfully (Adam Cadre's Photopia being the 
most obvious) such games are typically not puzzle driven. Because certain 
puzzles in Fate require eliciting a given response from a character, Fate 
occasionally becomes a guess-and-test game of "navigate the conversation menus," 
detracting from any realism the conversations may have had.

This aside, the game is easy to love. The judges of Spring Thing 2007 apparently
agree, and gave it First Place amongst the four entrants.

An imaginative exercise in using memories and symbolic puzzle-solving
to overcome your fears of heights, sounds, spiders, and the dark.  The

You really have to envision the scenes in your mind to win.  In

HARD, though, and I ended up sneaking a peek at most of their hints in
order to finish the game within two hours.

One of the forgotten treasures of the 1996 competition, Chuan-Tze Teo's
Fear, is subtitled "An Interactive Nightmare"--but though the setting
(alone in your house) and apparent initial premise (beginning of opening
text: "You are running for your life down dark, labyrinthine corridors,
your heart pounding almost as loudly as the heavy boots of your
relentless pursuer") evokes horror/slasher IF, this is actually
something quite different. The drama is more psychological than literal,
and the object is more akin to therapy than to saving your skin as
such--and while it's not a perfect effort, it's notable in a few
respects.

You're irrationally afraid of spiders, heights, sounds, and the dark,
and you wake up in the middle of the night, completely unable to move
around your house normally because of your fears. You end up conquering
your fears in a series of episodes--one of them seemingly a flashback,
two others apparently dreams--triggered by various objects you encounter
in your house. The way in which the flashbacks are triggered is a bit
tortured, but it's a minor sin--the episodes themselves are
imaginatively done, with reasonably logical connections to your various
phobias.

The atmosphere is nicely done: the game doesn't so much portray a scary
setting as portray an ordinary setting, with details magnified out of
proportion. E.g., "You feel suddenly claustrophobic as you hear a
rustling nearby. What lurks in the shadows, waiting to pounce?"
Sometimes, the events that set off your alarms are entirely internal:
"As you try to compose your mind, dark memories wash over you:
explosions, death, the tolling of funeral bells, gloom, isolation."
Arguably, this is one of the few works of IF where the PC's mind is as
well rendered as the physical setting. If there's a flaw, it's that you
don't get much about *how* you became so mentally crippled--there are
vague allusions to memories, but nothing concrete. It seems like
confronting whatever caused the fear in the first place would be both
more effective and more interesting, in terms of characterization.

Most of the puzzles take place in the phobia episodes, and they aren't
easy; a few of them, in fact, verge on the unfair. The worst case
involves an object that you have to destroy in order to use--and it's an
object that seems like it would be useful in its original states for
solving the puzzle at hand. The solutions are logical, but in a few
cases in particular, there isn't much in the game to signal that you're
on the right track, so things are harder than they should be. Adding to
the difficulty is a guess-the-syntax problem in one episode that may
prevent you from realizing that you're on the right track even when you
are. The last puzzle suddenly introduces a time limit, and it's a pretty
tight time limit at that--you're likely to miss it a few times while
you're figuring out what the game wants of you. There's a comprehensive
hint system, so the problems aren't intractable, but it'd be nice if the
game's execution were as good as its concept; puzzles as hard as these
risk requiring so much mental energy of the player that he/she loses
sight of the plot, which is the best thing the game has going for it.

The concept is good enough to overcome the game design problems, though,
and it's not simply an excuse for outlandish puzzle settings. The PC's
neuroses are sufficiently real that failing to do certain things to keep
them at bay actually kills you; saying "snap out of it" to the PC isn't
an option, of course. In that sense, you're forced to be the character
in a way that's still uncommon in IF (and was even more so in 1996,
before experimental IF was in vogue). The vividness of the setting lies
not in what you see but in how you experience it--i.e., through the eyes
of the phobic PC. It may not sound revolutionary, but getting the player
to focus not on the PC's external goals but on the internal barriers he
has to clear represents a real shift in goal-orientation--and even if
the puzzle-solving gets projected into external tasks, it's still worth
pondering. (That is, you don't actually delve into your own head, a la
<a href = "l.html#losing">Losing Your Grip</a>--though one scene comes close. But what's in your head
is sufficiently close to the surface throughout the game that your
puzzle-solving is almost the same thing.)

As a set of challenging puzzles or as an exercise in atmosphere, Fear
works, on the whole--well enough to be worth rediscovering five years
later.

URL:           <a href = "http://www.fsf.net/stella/">http://www.fsf.net/stella/</a>

From the "Fellowship of the Ring" manual:

   For starters, on the face of it, an Atari 2600 text adventure is
   ridiculous. An Atari 2600 text adventure that attempts to compress
   several hundred pages of densely-written prose into a 4K ROM image is
   even more ridiculous. It should be obvious even to the dimmest that
   the game is not intended as a serious interpretation of one of the
   most complex works of fiction ever put on paper, although it may in
   fact be about the best one can do given the limitations of the
   medium.

   Fellowship of the Ring is intended as a gentle spoof of the
   retro-gaming community, the mindset that attempts to produce
   derivative works in woefully inadequate media, fanfic authors in
   general, and the rec.arts.int-fiction and IFMud communities in
   particular.

Nothing conveys these sentiments more than the "Fellowship of the Ring"
(FotR) "cover" artwork. Robb Sherwin's magnificently-drawn battle scene
between Gandalf and the balrog could lead a player (if he were born
yesterday, perhaps) to expect an epic of modern cinematography and
Doom-like gameplay. Such a player would be more than a wee bit
disappointed.

This deception follows tradition. The Atari cartridge jacket for
"Baseball" conjured images of America's game that would have made Ken
Burns envious. The actual game featured two block figures and four tiny
bases on an all-green background. The jacket for "Combat" made you run
for cover as jets screamed across the smoky sky and fell tanks overran
your camp. The actual game featured two block figures and four tiny
bases on an all-green background. (Kidding. The background was blue.)

But even Atari wouldn't have had the temerity to release FotR in the
late '70s. Not from any moral qualms, but from a marketability
standpoint. Sure, reduce a work of epic scope to a few blips and doinks.
Go ahead, imply that the spectacular action and grand strategy depicted
on the cover occurs in the game. But, for goodness sake, you gotta have
replay value.

So, can you play FotR? Yes, you can play it. This isn't just a clever
joke, is it? No, it's not. But you must clear some hurdles, first. I had
to download and install an Atari emulator. Then I spent several minutes
tinkering with flicker rates and color, never really getting them to
satisfaction and settling for "close enough." This is not the game's
responsibility, of course, but a prospective player whose system isn't
already wired for hot Atari-2600 action should plan for a few minor
aggravations setting up the environment.

With that accomplished, you assume the role of Frodo, the ring-bearer.
You'll encounter key scenes from Tolkien's "Fellowship of the Ring" with
none of that boring travel stuff. The top of the screen briefly
describes the current situation. The bottom displays one of several
possible actions. You scroll with your joystick (or your keyboard keys
of choice) and when you reach the action you want to perform, you press
the fire button (for my money, nothing says "big red button" like
alt-tilde-F3.)

When your action matches what Frodo did in the book, you advance to the
next scene. Doing the wrong thing results in a "no, silly, that didn't
work" type message and an implied invitation to try again. If you've
read the book, you'll have a fifteen-second head start for each
encounter. You'll finish the entire game in five or six minutes,
depending.

Disclaimer: no socks were knocked off in the playing of FotR. But I did
feel a strange beauty with its competent simplicity. The meta-experience
implied in the manual wouldn't have worked without a functioning game
underneath. Adam mixes practical joke with compassion, satire with
devotion. And unlike "Baseball", FotR has no blocky graphics that remind
you you're playing a game. Nope, just text and your own imagination.

VERSION: Release 7

I quite enjoyed this game although it was very simple. Clearly a first
adventure. The main item in the game is the Fifteen Puzzle which is
implemented like one of those simple text games, you used to see in
computer pre-history a bit like Robots, by Torbj&#246;rn Andersson,
available from the IF archive. I remember playing Wrap and Zombies (a
variant of Robots) on a Commodore Pet (yes, computers did once exist
that used Tape Drives, and had memory measured in single 1K units),
kind of nostalgic, showing my age.

The rest of the game is very simple, locked doors, put the treasures
on the table etc... I worked out the remote control program in about
half a microsecond, but then I am a seasoned IF hand. I had a bit of
trouble working out how to use the ladder, a guess the verb problem,
which could be fixed. The game is short on narrative, with a lot of
short room descriptions, which could be fleshed out a bit. Clearly
this game was never going to have a good showing due to its
simplicity, but it was enjoyable none the less.

VERSION: Release 1

This game is apparently inspired by <a href = "i.html#i-0">I-0</a>, so the first time I played it I
spent the whole time doing I-0 type things: I stripped off everywhere
and waited to see how people would react. But the reactions were somehow
disappointing, and the descriptions were somehow disappointing, and I
felt a bit let down. I got the same feeling I get when reading Terry
Pratchett -- all very light-hearted, and the author is having a good
time, and the characters are having a good time, and everyone involved
is having a good time, and... I'm not, really.

One difference between this and I-0 is that the latter is much more
richly described and imagined. To take a concrete example, I-0 gives me
a very good picture of what Tracey Valencia's breasts look like. The
description of Betty Byline's boobs, on the other hand, is "You've never
had any complaints about them", which is so vague that she might as well
be wearing five woolen sweaters. Does "You've never had any complaints
about them" conjure up images in anyone's mind? No. And it's not that
I'm only slavering after good descriptions of T&A: a lot of the writing
here is similarly unevocative. I-0 it ain't.

The second time I played, however, I tried to appreciate Film at Eleven
on its own terms, and I found it a lot more likeable. In fact I found
the whole thing rather sweet and endearing. I liked the PC and her
infectious enthusiasm, I liked the quirky small-town inhabitants, and I
liked the friendly, gently chiding voice that was narrating. There's
nothing particularly memorable here, but Eleven makes a pleasant enough
way to pass an hour or two.

VERSION: Release 3

Sure enough, there are a lot of ways to classify text adventures in general,
and the puzzle-oriented of them, in particular. One of them is, to subdivide
puzzlefests into games where the puzzles more or less naturally spring from
the setting (one good example is Heist by Andy Phillips), and those where the
puzzles are just forcibly thrown together, without anything in particular
holding them in place (The Magic Toyshop from the first If-Comp, and
Labyrinth from the last one).

Somehow, I tend to like the games of the first sub-category a little bit
more. However, Final Selection represents a lucky exception of this rule:
while its meta-puzzle certainly is constructed artificially (you play here a
candidate for the position of the Director of the Museum and Institute for
Puzzles and Problem Solving, who is only going to get the job if he passes
the test his predecessor has prepared for him), its structure is thought-out
so carefully, and the overall implementation level is so deep that immersion
(or, more precise, the lack of immersion) never was an issue for me during
playing.

To complete the game, one has to hunt for words. I always feel a little
suspicious about that kind of puzzles, because the authors pretty often make
them overcomplicated -- say, by inventing obscure cyphers, and the like.
Final Selection, however, managed to dispel my apprehensions in this respect,
as well. While its puzzles are challenging enough, barely any of them require
tedious trial and error treatment, special knowledge, or confusing
deductions. On the other hand, there are enough red herrings to make the
player occasionally think that's exactly what the game expects of him;).
Thus, Final Selection fooled me into outsmarting myself, so that I tried to
interpret the hints I got in most perverse ways, and even solved one of the
puzzles in a tedious semi-brute force manner. To tell you the truth, I think
this was partly caused by my solving the puzzles "in a wrong order"; it
happened that I found the solution to one of the key problems that gave
away what exactly I had to do only towards the very end of the game; like, I
had all the jigsaw pieces yet had no clue where to put them to form a
picture.

As I mentioned before, the depth of implementation in Final Selection is
amazing. The author had to stuff a lot of objects into the only room of the
game (it was entered in the One Room Comp, after all!), and it must be said
he found a very elegant way to do this without overwhelming the player by 
overlong "You see  here" messages. He expanded the
concept of the room somewhat, dividing it in several areas. It doesn't break
the competition rules, because the room description doesn't change when you
move from one area to the other, and *all* objects in the room are reachable
from any part of it. Still, it makes the object managing task much more
convenient for the player. Another enhancement that makes the player's life
easier is a notepad of sorts, where any information you gain while playing
that could potentially be useful is jotted down automatically for later
reference.

The only (and pretty small) issue I encountered were some disambiguation
problems. This is a result of having so many objects in one room; some of
them inevitably have pretty similar names. For example, there was a box with
several buttons labeled from 1 to 15 in the game, and a scale with several
weights, their face values indicated. Somehow, any time I tried to "push 3",
the game would make me push the "weight 3", and "getting 3" resulted in the
attempt of taking the "button 3". Always typing in the whole object
descriptions was a little bit tedious, although I just might have been
unlucky. Anyway, I think this is more a problem on the part of the
interpreter than of the game itself.

But enough nitpicking -- this certainly isn't a game that makes one feel like
looking for faults. It even nourished my self-confidence by being both pretty
challenging and quite completable without hints. To put it short -- a
must-play for any puzzle-lover.

VERSION: 1.12

In an era of bite-sized IF, Finding Martin is a 12-course meal. Actually, it's 
more like one of those progressive dinners, where you go from one house to the 
next, a different course at each house, for a total of 12 courses in the 
evening. Except it's more like going to one of those every night for two weeks. 
Seriously, this game is HUGE. This is the kind of game where you might find an 
item with ten different modes, many of which can be used to adjust the item to 
one of its 720 different settings (and some of which do other things entirely),
settings which are split into twelve different themed sections, many of which 
give hints, some of which give red herrings, and some of which perform game 
functions. I am not exaggerating. And that's just one item out of dozens and 
dozens you'll find in this game way way way before you get anywhere near finding 
Martin himself.

If you love yourself a big, juicy puzzlefest, Finding Martin is cause for 
celebration. It's several times larger and more complex than anything Infocom 
ever attempted, and it's generally quite well-implemented. I encountered a 
number of glitches in my journey through the game, but they were all minor -- 
typos, missing synonyms, and underimplemented parsing mostly. There are a few 
logic errors here and there, but nothing game-crashing, and in fact very little 
that even caused me any trouble with a puzzle. Moreover, these problem areas are 
a very small percentage of the game itself, and this is a game that implements 
some highly complex behavior. A few errors here and there are quite forgivable 
in a game this ambitious in scope.

As for the puzzles themselves, the news is again mostly good. Most of the 
challenges are logical, and some are quite clever indeed. In particular, there's 
a puzzle (or maybe it would be more accurate to call it a suite of puzzles) 
toward the end of the game that is astoundingly intricate and deeply satisfying, 
the kind of a puzzle that would make up the entirety of another game. It's a 
time-travel scenario that takes the groundwork laid by <a href="s.html#sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> and expands it
by an order of magnitude, asking you to consider the relations between a number
of different time-slices as well as to coordinate the actions of multiple past 
selves with the actions of your current self in order to bypass certain 
barriers. However, well before you reach that puzzle you'll have made your way 
through a large number of obstacles that should scratch any inveterate puzzler's 
itch.

Not only that, the puzzles frequently build on each other, and most of the goals 
require several components to achieve. Finding Martin's world can feel 
astonishingly layered and convoluted. I frequently found that the discovery of a 
new item or command would add new dimensions to the pieces of the game I'd 
already uncovered, and that their interactions would open up new avenues for 
exploration. Of course, the flip side to this is that such a discovery would 
often compel me to explore the game's giant world yet again, trying the new key 
to see if it would unlock any heretofore unseen doors. At time, the gameworld 
feels like an obsessive-compulsive's paradise, but at least most of the 
interactions seem logical once they've been found.

Unfortunately, not all the puzzles manage to meet the same high standards. There 
are a number of read-the-author's-mind stumpers spread throughout the game. Some 
of these just require induction stretched absurdly far, but for several others I 
still have no idea how I was supposed to come up with the solution. There's 
another category, too: puzzles whose solution required some kind of cultural 
referent which I lacked, a la <a href="z.html#zork2">Zork II</a>'s baseball puzzle. Finding Martin's
pedigree consists mostly of geek lore like Monty Python and Douglas Adams, and
that stuff I've got covered, but a couple of puzzles require knowledge of Asian 
customs that I only learned from the walkthrough.

On the flip side of read-the-author's-mind are "puzzles" whose solution is 
entirely arbitrary but so heavily clued that the game pretty much just tells you 
what it is. Imagine a dark room with a description along these lines: "It's 
impossible to see anything in this room -- this must be what a cinnamon roll 
feels like when it's in the oven!" And lo and behold, you just happen to find a 
cinnamon roll later in the game, so when you bring it into the dark room and eat 
it, the cinnamon-oriented olfactory sensors in the walls detect it and turn on 
the lights, just as they've been programmed to do by the house's exceedingly 
eccentric and patient owner. That example isn't from the game, but there are 
several puzzles in there that are cut from the same cloth.

The substandard puzzles are a minority, and they certainly aren't enough to ruin 
the game, but my advice is: don't be afraid to bust out the walkthrough. Yes, 
sometimes you may find that a perfectly logical solution was staring you in the 
face, but other times you'll be relieved to just take the rather farfetched 
solution and move on with your life. Happily, the author is kind enough to 
provide a walkthrough on her web page that is broken up into 5-point clusters so 
as not to give away too much at once. However, if I may offer one more piece of 
advice: download the full walkthrough from that page and tuck it away somewhere 
on your hard drive. Otherwise, you may find yourself, as I did, stuck two-thirds
of the way through the game and panicking because the author's site has gone 
down. Luckily for me, the page came back up the next day and I found some cached 
bits on Yahoo in the meantime, but I could have saved a good deal of time and 
stress if I'd just had the full walkthrough to fall back on. 

Finally, take heed of the author's advice in the intro text: save your game a 
LOT. There were quite a number of times I found myself returning to an earlier 
savegame because I was trapped without a necessary item, or I wanted to undo 
something I'd done a bit improperly a few hundred moves earlier. Actually, that 
brings me to one of my chief gripes about Finding Martin: it sets a few 
arbitrary limits, ostensibly in the name of realism but functionally just to 
irritate the player. Chief among these is an inventory limit. Let's face it: 
this is not a game that holds realism particularly dear. Many of its puzzles 
consist of caprice and whimsy, and its entire plot is metaphysical to say the 
least. However, for some reason it decided that the player should only be able
to carry a limited number of objects, and it failed to provide any kind of 
bottomless sack-type object to circumvent this limit. Not only that, there's a 
puzzle component that steals items when they're dropped on the ground. Even more 
confoundingly, commands like PUT ALL ON TABLE are met with the response, "One 
thing at a time, please." And of course, there are many many journeys to pocket 
worlds whose obstacles require that the player has brought a particular item. 
Frequent were the times I cursed at this game for the way it forced me into 
numbingly dull inventory management tasks when I wanted to be having fun 
instead. Also, there are several instances of the game being pointlessly obtuse, 
along these lines:

   >READ BIG BOOK
   First you'd need to open it.

Come on. This is 2006 -- we know by now that READ implies OPEN. Such 
obstructionist world-modeling benefits nobody. 

I'm not sure if responses like this one and the response to PUT ALL are TADS 
default behavior. I do know that I sometimes wished this game had been written 
in Inform, so that I could get certain pieces of the Inform default 
functionality. Besides the lack of a sack_object, I was jonesing hard for an 
OBJECTS verb that would let me see all the items in the game I'd found up to 
that point. Similarly, a FULLSCORE command that told me all the puzzles I'd 
solved so far would have been most welcome, especially given how many times I 
had to restore back to an earlier saved game. Finally, having just played 
Bronze, I really missed conveniences like GO TO that allow me to traverse the 
game world without rattling off memorized directions to the parser. 

Okay, I've been complaining for a while, which makes it sound like I didn't 
enjoy the game. That's not true -- overall I had plenty of fun. It's just a 
similar feeling to what I had when playing <a href="o.html#once">Once And Future</a>, another enormous
old-school puzzlefest. Like OAF, Finding Martin provides lots of opportunities
to feel that satisfying *click* as logical components snap together, but forces 
a little too much tedium on the player after that click has happened. It's the 
figuring-out that's the fun part of a puzzle, not the follow-through of putting 
twenty pieces in just the right place once you know where they're supposed to 
go. Several of this game's puzzles would have been much more fun if they'd 
provided some way of automating that follow-through once the player has 
demonstrated understanding of the basic concept. 

Enough about the puzzles anyway. What about the story? Well, actually, the story 
is pretty much MIA for the first third or so of the game. We begin with a 
reasonably compelling premise: your brilliant but peculiar friend Martin has 
disappeared, and his family has asked you to explore his house in hopes of 
finding him. Why you and not, say, the police? Well, it seems that you may just 
be close enough to Martin's highly bizarre mindset to understand how to find him 
when the police wouldn't even be able to get in the door. Strong echoes of 
Hollywood Hijinx abound as you poke through rooms laden with fascinating devices 
and hidden exits, but there's not much more story to be had for a while. 
Finally, the game begins doling out plot in awkward lumps, but about two-thirds 
of the way through, these lumps smooth out and the story begins to tie together 
as more and more interconnections between Martin's family and friends, as well 
as his past, present, and future, reveal themselves. By the time I was rolling 
toward the endgame, I had felt genuinely moved several times. In fact, a couple 
of times Finding Martin hits a real IF sweet spot, where the solution to a 
puzzle not only advances the story but carries strong emotional content about 
the PC's role in the other characters' lives. I recall one moment in particular 
that gave me goosebumps, as I figured out how something I had done in a past 
time-travel scenario had affected the future, and how someone in that past had 
sent a message forward in time to me.

Remember how I mentioned the game's geeky pedigree? There are a number of 
references woven throughout the story that are pulled straight from the geek 
handbook: Star Trek meets Hitchhiker's meets Tolkien. Some of these made me 
smile, and some made me squirm. At times I felt like saying, "Yes, yes, I get 
it. You like Monty Python." Also, the writing around these references can 
sometimes feel a bit flat and ingratiating, as when the PC encounters a used 
paperback:

   >x novel
   It's a book by Douglas Adams, entitled "So Long and Thanks for All
   the Fish". Apparently this is the fourth book in the "Hitchhiker's
   Guide to the Galaxy" trilogy. It occurs to you that publishing the
   fourth book of a trilogy must be the toungue-in-cheek behavior of
   someone with a fantastic imagination and an audacious taste for the
   bizarre.

Ho ho ho. Nothing like belaboring that "fourth book in the trilogy" joke. I get 
it -- you like Douglas Adams. Also, "tongue".

Aside from that, though, the writing worked well. Most of the time it was 
transparent, but there were some clever twists and turns throughout, as well as 
a few good jokes. Having finished this game at last, and finally found Martin, I 
have to express my admiration. It must have been an unbelievable amount of work 
to put together a game of this size and scope, and for the most part it's done 
really well. If you're hungry for puzzles, Finding Martin should keep you fed 
for several weeks. Even if you're not a puzzler, grab a walkthrough and explore 
this game -- there are pleasures here for many tastes.

NAME: Fine-Tuned
AUTHOR: Dionysius Porcupine (a.k.a. Dennis Jerz)
EMAIL: jerzdg SP@G uwec.edu
DATE: 2001-2002
PARSER: Inform Standard
SUPPORTS: Z-code interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/FineTune.z8">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/FineTune.z8</a>
VERSION: Release 5

"The life of a daredevil adventurer leaves precious little time for
rest. There's always wickedness to thwart, innocence to preserve, and
honour to uphold." ...and with that short yet intriguing introduction,
you find yourself in the shoes (and goggles) of Troy Sterling, a man
well ahead of his time.

Fine-Tuned, in my opinion, is one of the better light-hearted games to
come along in quite awhile. Though early releases of the game were known
for being buggy, release five seems to be free of such distractions, and
is well worth setting aside an evening or two to enjoy. If you're
familiar with earlier versions of Fine-Tuned, release five has some
extra features as well, including enhanced interaction between the
characters, different solutions to some of the puzzles, a modified point
system, and additional implementation in certain areas of the game.

Dennis Jerz, writing as Dionysius Porcupine (a pen name which is
explained in the credits of the game), does a fantastic job of creating
an enjoyable game world, filled with memorable NPCs. As a player, I
normally don't enjoy games which are heavily scripted; I don't feel like
I'm playing the game so much as being dragged along through the plot.
Fortunately, Fine-Tuned is written in such a playful and imaginative way
that the player tends to forget that their fate is pre-determined.
Multiple solutions exist for some of the puzzles, and though each
solution garners the same number of points, the play differs somewhat,
giving the game replay value. Instead of arbitrarily forcing the plot,
chapters serve to break up the puzzles, allowing the player to focus on
the right objects in the right order, without that terrible "Led By The
Hand" feeling. The chapters also give you the opportunity to explore
other characters in the game aside from Troy Sterling, which makes for
interesting twists on how different characters think, feel, and interact
with the situations that are presented to them.

I could go on and on about who will enjoy this game. In short, I think
anyone with a sense of humor will have a fantastic time. If you've
played a variety of other IF titles, or are familiar with some of the
current authors of IF, you'll enjoy it a bit more. Beyond that, I found
that Jerz pulls in varied bits and pieces of real life from all over the
place. I laughed at loud several times because the game hit home on a
personal level, and I don't think I'm alone in this respect.

It is really little wonder that Fine-Tuned received nominations for Best
Setting and Best Player Character for the 2001 Xyzzy Awards. At the time
of this writing, the awards have not yet been handed out, and
Fine-Tuned's nominations wait alongside other deserving nominees.
Regardless of how the awards are distributed, Fine-Tuned is deserving of
both honors. Normally, I prefer to imagine that it's me in the game, but
for once, I really enjoyed playing the part of a highly developed PC.
Troy Sterling is a man of fashion, a hero for the younger generation,
defender of the environment and protector of the weak. He has definite
flair, and it's just plain fun to imagine yourself in his world - a
world with great friends, malicious enemies, fun puzzles, and humor at
every turn. All this, combined with Jerz's well-developed story, make
playing Fine-Tuned a delight.

(1.3)
WRITING: Strong, often amusing (1.6)  GAMEPLAY: Uneven at times (1.1)
PUZZLES: Not too hard, some a bit random (1.2) CHARACTERS: Amusing (1.4)

Some genres of literature have become common stomping grounds for IF,
but fairy tales are not among them: the dearth of children's stories
in the IF library means that Firebird attempts something distinctly
new, and the Russian themes make it all the more unique. Though many
traditionally fairy-tale tropes are present, including evil wizards,
captured princesses, and a series of marriages at the end, the author
gives the work more than enough humor and creativity to carry it off
successfully.

For what it's worth, you're the third son of a tsar, and you've been
chosen to bag the Firebird of the title, which has been stealing the
golden fruit from your father's orchard. Once you do catch the bird,
you get sent on a Quest to defeat the Evil Nasty Guy, overcoming scary
obstacles along the way and even getting Useful Social Guidance as
well, namely that you should be kind to animals. (Moreover, everything
seems to come in sets of three, a common number--along with seven--in
these stories.) Russian folk tales are not, it appears, drastically
different from those of Western Europe, such as the Brothers Grimm and
Hans Christian Andersen, certain not in their hallmarks. But there is
also plenty of humor along with the stock scenes and characters,
fortunately: a series of dimwitted guards, even if repetitive (you
defeat all of them with the same ploy), is sufficiently comic to make
the idea feel fresh.  There is plenty of absurdity as well: you get
help from an army of Japanese cooks at one point, who attack with
pepper grinders (really), and kissing a frog turns it into...an axe
murderer. The humorous bits and the small size of the game keep the
game moving along despite the more time-worn elements.

The authenticity of the references to actual Russian stories cannot be
verified, but judging from the bibliography and the footnotes
sprinkled here and there, the author seems to have done plenty of
homework along the way, which helps reduce the sense that this is a
generic fairy tale. At one point, you encounter two peasants swapping
jokes which, somehow, feel just bizarre enough to be real Russian
jokes; at another, you encounter &quot;three times nine&quot; knights, which, as
the author explains, really means, in Russian folk tale parlance,
27. There is more than enough of this sort of thing to keep the story
feeling fresh, though it's more the author's wit than the stories
themselves that gives the game its appeal. (My favorite reference of
all, actually, was the Firebird's tendency to &quot;whistle the greatest
hits of Stravinsky.&quot;) My one real objection is that women are more
often than not reduced to helpless playthings or decorative objects,
admittedly more the fault of the genre (and, maybe, the culture that
inspired the story) than the author but still a mite irritating. (And
ironic, since the author is one of very few women currently writing
IF.)

As noted, the puzzles are straightforward enough that they shouldn't
slow the player down much, though there are some slightly unfair
bits--notably, having to wait around for 15-20 turns before someone
comes along and drops an item that turns out to be useful later
on. There are some clues to the possibility of that event, but they're
not particularly strong. There are some other bugs, but not many, and
they don't impede the game all that much, and the end of the story is
appropriately climactic and easy to figure out. Moreover, even the few
moments where puzzle solutions are not entirely obvious are
decipherable on fairy-tale terms; since the genre demands some
suspension of logic anyway, thinking in fairy-story mode is usually
the best way to move things along; though one solution might be better
suggested by the context in that respect, it's certainly not
unfair. The relative ease of the puzzles also makes this an appealing
possibility for younger players, though some of the references--such
as the baba yaga--might require explanation. The real fly in the
ointment is a large maze; it doesn't seem like the game would lose
much if it were cut down or eliminated.

The writing is excellent, though there's rather a lot of it at certain
key points, often several screens' worth, and several descriptions are
a bit on the skimpy side--though most locales are standard enough that
they don't need extensive writing to come across. Appropriately for
the story and the age group, the writing gives more attention to plot
than to drawn-out description: events and action get long chunks of
text, not images. Still, it's worth noting that the author rarely
slips into fairy-tale excess--not every woman is breathtakingly
beautiful, not every obstacle is horribly dangerous, etc.--though one
occasionally wishes for more details than the author
provides. Moreover, as with most good fairy tales, the scale starts
small and then builds--you start out doing menial tasks for your
father--so that, when the author does lay on superlatives, they don't
feel tired.

Though the plot won't exactly throw anyone for a loop, Firebird is a
quick, enjoyable game that might herald something new, namely IF
grounded in a specific cultural tradition; <a href = "s.html#sound">Sound of One Hand Clapping</a>
and Pesach Adventure are the only other examples I can think of. If
Firebird encouraged more research into backgrounds of games, and more
innovative settings, it might lead to more creative games, never a bad
thing. In its own right, it's a worthy effort.


From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag15.html">SPAG #15</a> -- October 11, 1998

When Def Leppard's &quot;Pyromania&quot; album came out in 1983, it was a good
album and a big hit, but it never made it to #1 on the American
charts. Why?  Because Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; was perched there;
for months the Def Leppard album sat at #2, then sank, never reaching
the top spot. What does this have to do with IF? Hold your horses, I'm
getting to that. In the spring of 1998, Bonnie Montgomery suffered a
similar fate -- she put out an excellent game which never got the
recognition it deserved, because it was overshadowed by a concurrent
release, Andrew Plotkin's masterful &quot;Spider and Web.&quot; (Hmmm, perhaps
this comparison isn't so good after all.  I'm not sure how much
Plotkin wants to be the Michael Jackson of IF, let alone how thrilled
Montgomery is to be called its Def Leppard. Plus, now I've outed
myself as a fan of 80s heavy metal, not to mention an incurable
parenthetical rambler. I should probably just delete this whole first
paragraph, but knowing my Piers Anthony-like inability to erase
anything I've written, I probably won't. Magnus, I leave it up to
you.)

This review is meant to partly make up for the unwarranted neglect
&quot;Firebird&quot; has suffered. The game is cleverly written and well-coded,
with a number of design and puzzle strengths as well. Not only that,
it includes the command &quot;WEAR THE CLAW&quot;! How could I resist anything
that makes reference (though probably not consciously) to my own
one-game contribution to the world of IF? In fact, oddly enough,
&quot;Firebird&quot; has several resemblances to &quot;<a href = "w.html#claw">Wearing the Claw</a>&quot;: both
feature a circular wall with a plaque mounted upon it, each of which
has &quot;hints of honey&quot; inside, and both games have a section where the
parser prevents travel for three attempts. Now, of course I'm not
suggesting that &quot;Wearing the Claw&quot; was somehow the inspiration for
&quot;Firebird&quot; -- I doubt Ms. Montgomery has even played my game -- but I
did find it interesting that our games had so many specifics in
common. I'm inclined to think that these two games, taken together
with some others such as Infocom's &quot;<a href = "a.html#arthur">Arthur</a>&quot; and Whizzard's &quot;<a href = "l.html#lesson">Lesson of
the Tortoise</a>&quot;, are taking steps towards creating a basic vocabulary of
puzzles and devices for folk-tale-oriented IF.

Whether or not this is the case, &quot;Firebird&quot; stands on its own as a
remarkable piece of interactive fiction in its own right. Its clear,
elegant prose is a pleasure to read, and in spots becomes quite clever
indeed. For example, early on in the game our hero Ivan must pass by a
gaggle of overeager female admirers wearing beeswax lipstick (to which
Ivan is allergic). The women are described thus: &quot;They're swarming
everywhere, their constant chattering an irritating drone to your
ears.&quot;  However, if Ivan fails to pass, the death message says &quot;You
are swarmed by these eager noble honeys. Much as you feared, their
lipstick-tainted kisses cause hives to cover the entire surface of
your skin. A severe allergic reaction ensues and you succumb.&quot; In a
few quick sentences, Montgomery manages to work in &quot;swarm&quot; &quot;drone&quot;
&quot;hive&quot;, and &quot;honey&quot;; death by allergy has never been described with
such wordplay and wit! The combination of humor and action is
characteristic of &quot;Firebird,&quot; and gives it a lighthearted tone which
works quite well. Though the deeper structure of the game has a number
of fairly serious elements, Montgomery finds a way to inject humor
into most of the scenes, sometimes spilling over into outright
hilarity. That this mix of humor and action creates balance rather
than confusion is a testament to Montgomery's writing skills.

As strong as the writing is, the design is just as good. The game
provides multiple solutions to many of the puzzles, solutions which
often are so well thought-out in themselves that it's rewarding to
play through the puzzle each way, just to see how imaginatively the
game approaches the problems. &quot;Firebird&quot; is flexible enough to handle
lots of different kinds of thinking, and there were many times when I
thought I'd made a game-killing mistake and later found out that
although I had created a problem for myself, the game provided for a
way out of it as well.  Moreover, when critical junctions do come up,
the game gently suggests that you think about &quot;praying to save your
soul.&quot; If you acquiesce to this suggestion, the interpreter's &quot;save&quot;
function is invoked, and you now have a bookmark just behind the
critical point. There is only one place in which Montgomery's very
player-friendly design approach breaks down, which is the inclusion of
a fairly large, irritating maze. The maze, as far as I could
determine, is of the bad old variety to which there is no alternative
but slow, tedious mapping. Nonetheless, even if you hate mazes, it's
worth it to slog through this one, just because the last part of the
game is so rewarding. &quot;Firebird&quot; has several excellent climactic
scenes (which one you see depends on what you've done up to that
point) and it handles multiple endings in a number of highly creative
ways.

Finally, in addition to the big-picture factors, &quot;Firebird&quot; includes a
number of nicely done, subtle touches. For instance, the author (who
is married to <a href = "u.html#unkuul1">Unkuulian</a> implementor Chris Nebel) manages to sneak in a
very sly reference to that series by naming a nearby tavern &quot;The
Cheese and Pig Inn.&quot; Neat coding effects abound as well; at one point
Ivan is given a list of items he'll need in the next portion of the
story. The initial contents of this list vary depending on what Ivan
is holding when he receives it, and as he collects the items
necessary, the corresponding list items are checked. Another example
of clever coding is that the game not only frequently sends Ivan
tumbling to the ground, but it counts the number of falls he's taken,
and responds accordingly: &quot;Just a reminder, this is the third time
today that you and the ground have had an abrupt meeting.&quot; Puzzles are
also soundly executed: not too difficult, well-clued, and
strategically dispersed to keep the narrative at a steady pace. At
this writing, the game still has several bugs, one or two of which can
in fact render the game unwinnable. I have forwarded these bugs to the
author, and she assures me that they will be fixed in the next
release. If version 1.0 of &quot;Firebird&quot; was this good, it will be even
better when all the niggling problems are repaired.

&quot;Firebird&quot; proves beyond a doubt that the intersection between folk
tale and IF is a fertile one. At the risk of making an overreaching
generalization, I would contend that folk tales often tend to have a
strong sense of structure, a distinct &quot;best&quot; ending, somewhat &quot;flat&quot;
characters who mainly serve as ciphers for the plot, and frequent
appearances by riddles or somewhat artificial puzzles, all of which
are perfect for adaptation into conventional-form IF. The strengths of
interactive fiction, on the other hand, include exploration of exotic
landscapes, a strong sense of score/progress, and participation in
structured narratives, factors which can combine to give us new ways
to experience very ancient stories. What's more, the global audience
of interactive fiction means that no matter in what tradition an IF
folk tale is written, it will serve to teach at least some of its
players about cultures outside their own. Here's hoping that others
follow in the trail that &quot;Firebird&quot; has blazed.

VERSION: 1

Writing for the IF Art Show isn't easy, I know. Faced with the remit
"explore interactivity", where do you begin? 

Jacqueline A. Lott chose to begin with an engaging character. The
protagonist of The Fire Tower is consistently drawn, from the results of
">look at me", ("You glance down and the first thing you see are your
hiking boots. They're serious hiking boots...") to knowledgeable asides
made during the IF. She even has a purpose, having come to the fringes
of Mount Cammerer in the Appalachians to walk solo and get away "from
everything: work, responsibilities..."

Though it was good to find such a well-presented character, it's Mount
Cammerer that stars in this piece. This was an entry in the 2004 IF Art
Show "landscape" section. It took best of show and "best setting" at the
following XYZZYs. 

The first, powerful impact is of a beautiful landscape beautifully
presented. It's tempting to describe sweeping scenes with flowery prose
but the author resists that temptation. The text is sparse and
transparent; it doesn't get in the way of the country depicted and
everything is described with an infectious enthusiasm. I was left
feeling relaxed, as though I'd been there, at least in part. I presume
that was the main objective of the piece, so it's a success from the
first play through.

That sense of "being there" is enhanced by the sheer interactivity of
the piece. Faced with something that says, in essence, "See how
interactive I am!" I start to verb the nouns. This setting is deeply
implemented. Almost everything can be examined, heard, smelled, felt and
tasted. I know more about Appalachian flora now than I did before
playing.

Sometimes a lack of options left me feeling frustrated. I wanted to go
back on myself or try routes that I wasn't allowed to. I was
particularly miffed to find that I missed the work's titular tower
because, having moved away from it without entering in order to re-check
a previous description, I was barred from returning. But this isn't a
game -- the author's trying to guide the player around a landscape --
nor would route reversals or unplanned diversions be in character for
the experienced lone-walker protagonist. 

Time -- always a difficult dimension in landscape -- is well handled.
The protagonist's watch counts one minute for each turn and each travel
description adds a number of minutes dependent on the terrain covered.
There's a sense of time passing at a realistic rate, adding to the sense
of "being there".

I was disappointed with the centre of the game, the fire tower. It being
the target and title of my walk, I was looking forward to finding
something extra there. It's as beautifully described as everything else,
but I'm not sure it deserves its pivotal placement.

It's a good sign if the only major gripe I can raise about an IF is that
I was left wanting more. In particular I wanted to explore the issues of
stilting and entrapment -- barely but skillfully hinted at -- that led
to this walk in the first place. I wanted to turn the protagonist to an
equipment shop and then along the whole Appalachian trail, fulfilling
her lifetime dream. For a player like me, without any real interest in
puzzles, it wouldn't take much to turn this into a full length game in
the Sunset Over Savannah mode. 

Perhaps the best praise I can offer the piece is this: I wish I'd
written it. Its clean, artless-seeming approach fosters the illusion
that I could have. In fact, I think I feel a landscape entry for next
year's IF Art Show coming on. But first I'm going back to see if I can
find the bear that Emily Short saw.

VERSION: 2.0 (02/20/2002)

Have you ever wished you could go back in time and prevent a mistake?
Have you ever wished all those time travel games would let you change
things for the better rather than preserve history the way it is? Well,
wish no more! First Things First is a recent game that lets you do just
that. You start out in the present, as an eccentric person who dreams of
building a time machine. You just came back from the library, where as
usual, you were reading on the subject. It is late, so you were thinking
of just going to sleep. However, you've done what we've all done in the
past. You've locked yourself out of your house! The spare key is nowhere
around. As you begin to hunt for your spare key, something else begins
to get your attention. Why is the roof in such lousy shape after only 10
years? What's this squirrel doing on my roof? Why didn't I ever plant a
tree on the south side of my house? In the midst of all your wondering,
a time machine appears, and the real game begins.

This game reminds me of <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses</a> in a lot of ways. Like Curses, you are
doing something ordinary, and gradually get yourself into something
else. Like Curses, this is a puzzle fest. It got the XYZZY award for
best puzzles for a good reason. Most of the puzzles are very logical,
and some have multiple solutions. For example, there are at least 2,
maybe 3 ways to get rid of the dog, and 2 ways to repair the wheel
barrow. Be warned, the game can be made unwinnable, so save early, and
keep multiple saves especially before doing something that will put an
item out of play. Be extremely careful with money! Some items serve no
purpose, while others have multiple uses. Still others are optional
depending on how you go about solving puzzles. There is a contraption
called a herring detector which will tell you if something is a red
herring or not. It really breaks the mimisis of the game, so I would
advise not using it unless you are truly desperate.

This game has a maze, but it has a solution that doesn't involve
dropping things. The best part is that once you get through it, you
never need to go through it again.

Overall, I liked this game. It has a few bugs here and there, but no
real show stoppers. It is refreshing to actually be able to do something
about the past instead of being told to accept it for what it is. My
only real complaint is that the ending leaves a few loose ends, and I
think the environmental tone is a bit too obvious. Also, some
descriptions are a bit awkward. There is one place where the word
"prettily" appears twice in the same sentence. Other than that, it's not
a bad game, and there is even an Easter Egg room with a unique surprise.
I found it to be difficult, but not insanely so. Anybody who wants a
good old-fashioned puzzle-filled IF experience, and has some time on
their hands should give this one a try.

AUTHOR: Magnetic Scrolls
DATE: Mid-80's?
SUPPORTS: See note below
AVAILABILITY: Commercial (se note)

Fish rocks dammit! Magnetic Scrolls kill Infocom dead! You heard me!
This game is full to the gills with puns. The game is one big pun.
Magnetic Scrolls is a Pommy company and all its games have that Pommy
feel and &quot;English&quot; spelling.

The story concerns you, who are an interdimensional secret agent whose
job it is to warp into worlds and thwart the terrorists of the Seven
Deadly Fins.

The start of the game sees you relaxing inside the body of a fish in a
fishbowl.  Your first task is to solve three mini puzzles of an
&quot;intermediate&quot; toughness, then its onto the &quot;large&quot; portion of the
game in the land where everyone is a fish.

The puzzles are very clever and logical and the text is very &quot;Magnetic
Scrollsish&quot; and makes for a great read.

The parser is probably the best of all the Magnetic Scrolls games and
is as good, if not better than the Infocom parsers.

I absolutley loved this game.

{ Editor's Note concerning Availability:

  The Magnetic Scrolls games were sold commercially. Second-hand copies
  occasionally turn up for sale in the games newsgroups. Reliable
  sources also tell us that they are available from certain well-known
  FTP sites (though not from the IF-archive). Of course, the illegality
  of such distribution channels forbids us from mention them here...

  The good news is that you don't need a semi-antique computer to play
  these games (however you manage to get a copy): Niclas Karlsson has
  written a portable interpreter called _Magnetic_ which runs on a
  variety of platforms. See

VERSION: Release 1

When I began playing Flat Feet I was a bit surprised that it only ranked
fourth in the 2005 Spring Thing Competition. Despite not having played the 
other games I assumed they must have been very good to place better than 
this one. However, it quickly became apparent that the game's  auspicious 
beginning was a broken promise.

In Flat Feet you are a cat and you have a detective agency with your ferret 
partner, Ralph. You haven't had a mystery to solve in a long time but this 
quickly changes. The mystery involves you and Ralph traveling around San 
Francisco trying to solve a series of robberies.

The game opens with a clever prologue and enjoyable interplay between you 
and Ralph. After you receive your assignment and head off there is even an 
"in-joke" that anybody who has attempted to learn the INFORM language will 
likely appreciate. But after that the game becomes tedious as you try to 
solve a couple of contrived puzzles to achieve the simplest tasks. 
Depending on what you already have and the places YOU have visited, these 
puzzles could require a lot of traveling that only slows down the pace. 
Grannted the places you have to visit are interesting authentic San 
Francisco locations but the descriptions could have been more interesting 
and more detailed. None of these puzzles contributed directly to plot 
development and thus the mystery is thin and the perpetrator leaves behind 
some evidence that makes you question her intelligence.

The game also doesn't take advantage of some interesting ideas. I thought 
that being a cat would provide some interesting twists, ie using your 
agility to solve a puzzle or two. In fact, the first puzzle would have been 
solved easily by a cat. Unfortunately being a cat is irrelevant. At one 
point you are offered a different point-of-view of the city but again the 
game doesn't really take advantage of it in its room descriptions (although 
this may have been an attempt by the author to comment on how dirty the 
city is, play the game and you'll see what I mean).

There is a rather poor attempt at creating alternate endings. The final 
showdown could occur in any of six locations but the ending is ultimately 
always the same. You don't even have to get all the evidence to catch the 
robber, the one piece of evidence you do need is so generic that it allows 
for any of six possible suspects. Yet this flimsy evidence is still enough 
proof to confront the robber.

There are some aspects of the game I did enjhoy.  The game was sometimes 
very witty and the comeraderie between yu and the ferret was fun. I liked 
the locations (maybe only because I visited there once) and there are some 
bizarre happenings that may hold some interest. I didn't encounter any bugs 
or any problems interfacing with the game although some room descriptions 
only make sense the first time you enter them or approach the room from a 
certain direction.

I think Flat Feet is probably worth playing if you are interested in the 
San Francisco area and would like to read about some of the attractions 
there. Otherwise you may find the game a bit too tedious  and the weak plot 
won't maintain your interest.

	Note: There is a walkthrough and source code files available with 
the game.  The walkthrough is a sample transcript complete with room 
descriptions so it may be tempting to simply read that and not play the 
game.

VERSION: Release 1

Floatpoint is about a planet populated by genetically-engineered humans who want 
to come back to earth, or something like that. I don't remember exactly because, 
frankly, I didn't care. The author never made me feel like the things I was 
doing or the situation itself really mattered. This seems strange, because the 
whole point of the game is to figure out what's going on and decide what to do 
about it. But while I was certainly interested in the game as a puzzle, I ended 
up not caring about it as a story.

The writing is good, although some of the descriptions were a bit long-winded 
for my tastes. I was probably playing just before bed, though, so that might 
have made me less patient with the descriptions than I otherwise would have 
been. The game could also have used a little more technical work. I ran into a 
few bugs and unimplemented things, and the whole game ran really slowly, with 
long pauses after each command. None of these things were a big deal- I even got 
used to the pauses after a while- but they made the game feel unpolished.

Although I didn't like the game all that much, there was one aspect I really did 
like. Floatpoint used two devices to help communicate the story, and both of 
them worked well for me. They were a message system used to communicate with 
some distant NPCs, and a computer database containing information from your 
predecessor.

The message system involves a console in the "communications room" and a beeper 
that you carry around with you. When someone sends you a message, your beeper 
alerts you to the fact. You can then go to the communications room and use the 
console to read and reply to any messages that you've received. The replies are 
written automatically; you only choose whether or not to send them. Often, you 
will get a response to your reply a while after you send it, so you end up 
engaging in some good sized conversations this way.

These messages arrive every so often through most of the game, and that's what I 
really liked about the system. For one thing, the "message waiting" beeper 
pleasantly interrupted my other exploration, breaking up what might have become 
monotonous otherwise. And I found that I anticipated the answers to my messages 
in the same way that I anticipate an email from someone, which added to the fun 
of reading them when they finally arrived. The message system did a good job of 
keeping me engaged with the game.

The other device that I enjoyed playing with was a computer database in which I 
could look up journal entries from one of the NPCs and information about the 
game's background. This is surprising, because normally I *hate* consultable 
objects in adventure games. It feels like I'm playing guess-the-noun, and I'm 
always afraid that I've missed a noun that was important. (And often I'm right.)

But the database in Floatpoint avoids this problem in two related ways: most 
keywords will bring up multiple articles, and most articles have multiple 
keywords attached to them. The first is nice because you can look up a person's 
name (for example) and see everything in the database related to them. Then, if 
one of the articles that comes up mentions something else interesting that's 
related to the character, you can look that up and see what the database has to 
say about it. I had a lot of fun searching through the database this way. And I 
wasn't nearly as worried as I usually am about missing something, because with 
multiple keywords for each article, I figured I was pretty sure to run into any 
important ones eventually. (And in fact I did.) To me, playing with the database 
was the best part of the whole game.

Even though I didn't care for the story, Floatpoint was worthwhile just to play 
with these toys. And hey, you might like the story better than I did. So if you 
have any taste for story-driven IF, I'd certainly recommend taking a look at 
this game.

If the recently released <a href = "b.html#breakin">Break-In</a> is any indication, the effects of the
1998 chicken comp may be with us for years to come, as games inspired by
the chicken theme but not finished on time appear one by one, covering
the landscape with feathers and...well, best not get into that. At any
rate, Ivan Cockrum's Foggywood Hijinx was one of the first
chicken-themed post-chicken-comp efforts (we also saw <a href = "d.html#downtown">Downtown Tokyo,
Present Day</a> not long afterwards), and it's an amusing effort that's
somewhere between a spoof of the inherit-your-uncle's-fortune genre and
a Penn & Teller homage.

Your uncle was fond of practical jokes, it seems, and his last and
greatest joke, now that he's dead, is to turn the whole family into
chickens when they show up to squabble over his estate. The challenge is
to overcome your newfound limitations and find a way out of the problem,
using your uncle's various wacky inventions that litter his study. The
inventions themselves are at least as amusing as the premise, since they
include things like the Hedge Helpers (a pair of hands to extend one's
reach) or the Buffalo-on-a-Spring. There's really only one puzzle, but
it's quite a puzzle--it involves all sorts of clever mechanical
finagling, and the various peculiar devices are described well enough to
make the puzzle solvable. (Well, mostly--there are a few slightly
misleading responses.)

The point of Foggywood Hijinx is the humor, obviously, and there's
enough of it to keep the game going for a while. Notably, a TV features
Julia Child raving dementedly about the joys of killing chickens, e.g.:
"I once killed a chicken just to watch it die." Your various bickering
relatives continue to bicker in chicken form, but in more amusing ways:
"Uncle Orpington pulls a long strand of fiber from the carpet. Cousin
Red jealously tries to snatch it away, and a tug-of-war ensues." This
wouldn't be enough to sustain anything other than a very short game, of
course--and it might not be enough, depending on how long it takes you
to figure out the puzzle, to get through this one without the jokes
getting stale. Still, there are a few chuckles here and there, which is
all that can be asked of a chicken-comp game.

In sum, it's funny enough to be worth the 10-15 minutes, and if you
haven't already seen too much IF involving chickens, it's worth a shot.

VERSION: Release 1.02

For a Change is indeed a change, and in a way it's a good example of
what text IF can be--it manages to leave most of the visual details
entirely to the player's imagination by refusing to pin down exactly
what the PC is seeing or experiencing, except in the most general terms.
The result is either maddening or evocative, depending on the player; if
the player isn't willing to do the work of visualizing the scene as it
unfolds (and supplying the images where the author declines to), the
game more than likely remains elusive, amorphous. Either way, it takes
some mental adjustment to appreciate what For a Change is trying to do.

The other innovative aspect of For a Change is the syntax, which is
fractured, confusing, and fascinating; the author has chosen a mode of
expression that makes sense on its own terms, but is quite definitely
nonstandard English. Everything can be deciphered with a little thought,
of course, and usually the key is realizing that a word, in the game's
world, can act as a different part of speech than expected. The effect
is very much like reading e.e. cummings (I was reminded in particular of
the poem "anyone lived in a pretty how town"); once the reader
recognizes how certain words are being used (in that particular poem,
for instance, "anyone" should be parsed as a name), the whole thing
falls into place. The syntactical shifts in For a Change usually arising
from the way the author personifies and animates generally inanimate
objects by giving them verbs suggesting conscious action. It's a credit
to the author that his work recalls cummings, and that getting used to
the unusual syntax is rewarding rather than irritating.

Due to the above elements, For a Change is both a challenge and a
pleasure to read. The following is typical of both aspects:

   Lantern Room
   This subsection of the inset brightens and flickers. The shadows
   belong to the air more than you do, it seems. They walk the cordstone
   walls; they move and excite. The shadows look to a wall, to bars in
   the wall, and the songlantern behind them. Further in is east,
   further out is west, and a slope obtains up to the south.

   >examine songlantern
   The songlantern hums and burbles, circled by brightening words,
   evading the bars and piercing the silence and darkness.

"The shadows look to a wall..." suggests that the shadows converge on
the bars, but the reader must first recognize that "look" is the game's
way of personifying and giving life to the shadows, rather than binding
them to the literal and inanimate reality. As for the songlantern, the
reader has no way of visualizing what it is, and the description doesn't
help; it merely gives the reader some elements to draw on in coming up
with his or her own image. The word itself is evocative, rather than
merely cryptic (at least, I found it so)--and the description conjures
up a variety of images and sounds in a way that few straight-syntax
descriptions could do. Similar is the following: "Then there is a moment
of loudness and shock." An explosion? A clap of thunder? A scream? It
could be any one, or all three, or none; the language is calculated to
allow the player to choose.

The fiction aspect of For a Change succeeds brilliantly, then (in my
book, at least), but does it work as a game? The bag is a little more
mixed on this count. Most of the puzzles require intuitive leaps of one
kind or another, some greater than others; there is logic to all of them
(logic on the game's terms, at least), but some of them make more sense
after the fact. The problem in one particular puzzle is that the game
requires a syntactical leap of faith, in a sense--not so much in what
you type as in the way you parse a certain object's name, and the
properties you ascribe to the object as a result of the parsing. The
correct solution is quite consistent with the feel of the game, but
getting used to the game's approach to grammar and actually predicting
how the game will approach a given word (sufficiently so to make the
prediction the basis for a puzzle solution) are two different things.

The other problem with the game element of For a Change is that it's a
little directionless; the initial directive is this: "The sun is gone.
It must be brought. You have a rock," which doesn't exactly give the
player much of a nudge in discerning the proper path. Adding to the
aimlessness aspect is that the first puzzle isn't solvable until a
certain event happens, and it's possible for the player to fail to
trigger the event early on and wander around getting frustrated. True,
the game is relatively small, and there aren't so many puzzles that the
player is likely to remain clueless for long--and the hint system does
help. Still, the initial playing experience can be a little
daunting--the player's initial reaction might well be "not only don't I
understand what anything is, I don't even know what I'm supposed to be
doing or how to go about it."

Even if it's less than perfect as a game, though, the interactive aspect
of For a Change is one of its greatest strengths--because it is through
the player's interactions with the environment that he or she generates
images, forms an impression of what this elusive world is like. Giving
the player a variety of ways to interact with the characters and objects
ensures that different players will come away with different
impressions, for example in the following:

   >examine toolman

   The toolman is bright and misty. Thoughts and uses hang from his
   shoulders like birds.

Or:

   >give bar to toolman
   The toolman gently misunderstands.

   The toolman smiles softly.

A player can easily generate an image of the toolman as animate or
inanimate, depending on how he or she chooses to approach him (or it),
and neither one is clearly wrong or right. This indeterminacy can be
achieved in static fiction, to be sure, but interactive fiction can do
it much better--an author can deliberately accommodate multiple ways of
visualizing the same object or character--and For a Change takes
advantage of its medium in some novel ways. Similarly intriguing about
For a Change is the way it deals with scale; all measurements are
relative ("To your north is a massive transparent cube, perhaps five of
your heights on each side"), leaving the distinct possibility that the
events are taking place on a microscopic level, or a cosmic level, or
somewhere in between.

Though, again, it's not for everyone, For a Change is the sort of
experimental work that the competition was meant to foster; it's not the
most successful entry as a game, but it's certainly well done fiction,
and I gave it an 8 in the competition.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag22.html">SPAG #22</a> -- September 15, 2000

Imagine a certain use of the English language that, while ostensibly
precise, and having perfect internal coherence, is such that the reader
cannot immediately make sense out of it; he has to make (conscious or
reflexive) assumptions as to what every phrase might mean. Combine this
use of the language with an equally bizarre vocabulary that (though
English) the reader has to pick up on the fly. Facing this prose, not
all readers have to (and will not) construct the same mental imagery,
but the internal coherence keeps the various interpretations more or
less "aligned", in such a way that all (or most at least) readers can
sensibly interact with the objects communicated.

The outcome is something deeply bizarre, resulting in a rather dreamlike
quality: everything has some sort of internal logic, even if you don't
know what it is. And in fact, as the author has said in an interview
(published in <a href = "backissues/spag19.html">SPAG #19</a>), some of the most peculiar articulations derive
from fragments of his dreams, or from thoughts captured when his mind
was otherwise empty.

In a sense, this game itself presents a very interesting argument about
the way understanding natural language works: Language is understood
through context. (This is a known fact at least since W. v. O. Quine
showed that "statements about the external world face the tribunal of
experience not individually but only as a corporate body.") When context
is missing, understanding is based on familiarity; we internally
contextualize the language based on our previous experiences. The
description of the <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a> house's kitchen is more understandable than the
description of Schmidt's "toolman", because we all have been in a
kitchen. When the bonds to familiarity are weakened significantly (like
in this game), the only remaining shelter for reason is the language's
internal structure (coherence); this is what guides the reader's mind in
its random attempt to establish plausible and familiar metaphors. Think
about it for a while.

This short piece of interactive fiction (together with a few others like
Cadre's <a href = "s.html#shrapnel">Shrapnel</a>) supports in a very powerful way Adam Cadre's
statement that:

   ...freed from commercial concerns, "text adventure games" have
   morphed into "interactive fiction" -- an increasingly experimental
   medium with every bit as much potential as straight prose...

Schmidt has backed away a bit from the experimental approach outlined
above by making sure that while the reader receives this "odd" language,
he will not have to produce any. Thus any form of interaction will be
done using "normal" verbs and normal phrasing (although sometimes
involving objects which are not "perfectly normal"). I think it would be
interesting to see a game that would require its readers to actively
test their understanding of such a strange universe by verbally
re-creating its inner logic, but I also share the doubts of the author
as to whether the outcome would be playable.

In the Author's Notes (included in the game, but available only after it
is solved), Schmidt mentions the book "Wire and String" by Dan Marcus,
and "The Book of the New Sun" by Gene Wolfe as works that influenced the
writing of this game. I was not aware of these books but after I played
the game I looked for them and read them. I deeply enjoyed reading them,
especially Marcus's book. Apart from being interesting works by
themselves they help clarify the underlying intentions of Schmidt's
work.

Closing with a negative remark: The game and the game-world are very
short. I know it is supposed to be so, since it is a competition entry,
but I would really like to see these ideas worked on a much larger
scale. 

Conclusion: It is a must-play.

     Directory with game and various maps in PDF files plus walk-through
VERSION: 2

It has been said that when being interviewed, you are primarily judged
by the first 10 seconds. For me, this is partly true of Interactive
Fiction as well. I am more likely to stick to a game which has a good
introduction than one whose introduction is poorly written. An
introduction full of spelling errors and bad grammar makes me tend to
question the game. In this regard, I was really unsure what to think
when I loaded up Fort Aegea and got this introduction.

   "AAACHOOOO!!"

   Waking up with a start, you stare blankly into space, and rub your
   watery eyes. While fumbling around on your night table you find a
   piece of parchment in which to blow your nose and wipe your brow.
   It's spring and with it comes your annual bout of hay fever; a
   condition that is certainly not made any better by the fact that
   you're living on an outpost in the wilderness. No matter. You rise
   from bed with a yawn and a stretch, trying to focus mentally for the
   day ahead.

   Being the sole Priestess representing the Order of the Amylyan Druids
   in this distant Northern outpost has never been easy. However, as the
   settlers are incredibly humble and always helpful, your experience
   has been very rewarding.

   Oh well, another day filled with dispute resolution, work
   preparation, and general governance over your small settlement. The
   sun hasn't risen yet, so you still have a few minutes to yourself.

I don't think there's ever been a PC in all of IF with hay fever, and
the only case of hay fever I can recall offhand is the ogre in
<a href = "s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</a>. So, right off, I had a good sense of my character, but no
clue what the story would be about. This is often a good thing, and the
story in this particular game is complicated enough that a lengthy
introduction would be a detriment, but still, this didn't do anything
but make me wonder what I was getting into.

This game is a sequel to <a href = "j.html#jewel">The Jewel of Knowledge</a>, and that made me feel a
bit odd since I'd never gotten around to playing that particular game.
However, this one stands on its own for the most part. The story is
described in an interactive prolog which is a nifty idea. Basically,
it's just another ordinary day until a farmer comes in through the gate
of Fort Aegea badly wounded. He tells you of a demon who wants the blood
of 4 virgins over 30 just before dying. Terrified, you consult some
higher authorities and learn that this demon is actually a dragon. The
dragon breathes toxic gas rather than fire and is rather nasty.
Desperately hoping to save the fort from certain destruction, you let
the dragon talk you into a dangerous game of cat and mouse. You have to
survive the day while the dragon tries to kill you. If you survive, he
will leave. Otherwise, he has the whole fort's population for lunch. So,
the bulk of the game involves trying to keep your hide intact and
protect others.

There were two things I really disliked about this game. First of all,
and by far the most important, there is a huge amount of violence in the
story. While I can understand that dragons are mean and hurt people, I
think the author went a bit too far. For example, a husband and wife
with a baby are some of the people you try to help. First, the husband
dies like so:

   The Dragon throws an agile paw at Pierre and knocks him heavily off
   the path and unfortunately, off a precipice that you're sure will end
   off a few hundred meters down the side of the mountain.

   "PIERRE!" screams Annie, the look of hysteria gaining momentum on her
   face. She hands you Etienne and sobs, "You must protect him
   Priestess, at all costs!"

   Annie turns to face the dragon and begins running.

As is obvious, the next move, Annie meets her maker even more violently:

   Annie runs screaming head first into the Dragon's midriff. The dragon
   deflects her mild blow and clasps his arms around her waist with
   little effort. There is a short struggle followed by a bone-crunching
   snap, after which the Green Dragon throws Annie's lifeless body into
   the shrubs surrounding the clearing. His visage shows a hint of pity.

It wouldn't be so bad if these were the only instances of such, but this
sort of thing happens repeatedly throughout the story. There is some
attempt to explain it at the end, but I found it to be a thin excuse.

The second thing that hurt Fort Aegea for me is the spell casting. You
have a few spells you can cast which have very unique effects. However,
the problem is that almost every single puzzles solution involves
casting one of about four spells. There is one spell that is completely
useless in the game, though. The game specifically mentions that you are
an experienced druid and therefore have many spells memorized. I would
have preferred it if more of the puzzles involve non-magical solutions.
I keep thinking of Graham Nelson's The Craft of Adventure in which he
warns against overuse of magic. He said "the majority of puzzles should
be soluble by hand -- or else the player will start to feel that it
would save a good deal of time and effort just to find the 'win game'
spell and be done with it." I completely agree with him on this point
and note that in the entire <a href = "e.html#enchanttril">Enchanter trilogy</a>, there are at least some
puzzles that can be solved without magic. One good thing about the magic
system is that you never have to learn spells. You always have them
memorized and can even look them up individually through a menu. The
spell names also make sense for a change. For example "crewa" means
create water. So, I didn't mind the magic system, and some of its uses
were clever, but I would have preferred that more than one or two
puzzles could be solved without it.

I think the best thing this game has going for it is the completeness of
the world. It is a fairly detailed world model and it feels very real
with the exception of the description of the dragon that sounds like it
came straight from Dungeons and Dragons or one of its imitators. Another
plus is the interactive introduction. It lets the player get comfortable
with the environment, start to understand what things are normally like,
and to really appreciate the shock of the dragon's sudden appearance.
Lastly, the game has two endings, and I always find multiple endings to
be a nice touch when done well.

So, overall, Fort Aegea is a real mixed bag with both good and bad
points. I rated it a 6 in the competition.

NAME: Four in One
AUTHOR: J. Robinson Wheeler
E-MAIL: wheeler SP@G jump.net
DATE: 1998
PARSER: TADS standard
SUPPORTS: TADS interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition98/tads/fourin1/fourin1.gam">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition98/tads/fourin1/fourin1.gam</a>
VERSION: Release 1.0

Playing Four In One, I was in an unusual, unprecedented (for me)
situation: I was playing a game of which I had already read a
complete, winning transcript. Not a walkthrough, but a transcript of
commands and game responses. It seems that the author submitted this
transcript to Stephen Granade's IF Fan Fest, an informal
quasi-competition held at Granade's Mining Company web page. If I had
known this transcript was also going to be a competition game, I
wouldn't have read it, because I hate spoilers.  But I didn't know
that, so I read it, and it made playing the game a very strange
experience -- the whole thing gave me a very strong sense of deja
vu. Now, granted, the transcript isn't an exact one. You can't follow
that transcript and hope to win the game, because the commands are not
all perfectly duplicated, and there are some other differences between
the two as well. However, they have a *lot* in common. Now, the funny
thing about this is that when I initially read the Four in One
transcript, my thought was &quot;It's a funny idea, but it would be far too
difficult to actually turn into a game.&quot; Well, I have been proved
wrong.

The idea behind the game is that you're a film director in the heyday
of the Marx brothers, and you're directing them in their first picture
for MGM. Or at least, you're trying to direct them. Apparently,
keeping all the Marxes in one room, getting along, and working
productively is somewhat akin to herding cats. Consequently, you're
forced into the position of chasing after them, collecting them one by
one, and forcing them to follow you around to their (and your)
considerable annoyance. Even once you've got them all on the set and
rehearsed, there's no guarantee that one or more of them won't go
bolting off to make a phone call, hang out at the catering table, or
read a book. What's worse, you have only two hours to get a good take
on a crucial scene, or you and the picture will both be canned. The
transcript makes this into a hilarious situation, showing the Marx
brothers at their zaniest even when the cameras aren't rolling. In
fact, *all* the comedy takes place when the cameras aren't
rolling. This is the kind of thing that I didn't think an IF game
would be able to pull off, but Four in One is the living proof. It's
not as funny as the transcript, but it works, especially in places
like Chico's dressing room, where more and more people keep entering,
pushing you inexorably to the back wall like the first entrant in a
phone-booth-stuffing competition. Scenes like this can be irritating
as well, and the game sometimes steps across the fine line between
funny aggravation and just plain aggravating aggravation. However,
with the exception of one internal TADS error that I found, the
technical details of the writing and coding are executed superbly, and
this goes a long way towards smoothing out any annoyances.

The place where the game's technical proficiency shines the most is in
its characters. Four In One is a the most character-intensive piece of
IF I've ever played. Almost every location has one or more characters
in it at all times, and these characters are as fully implemented as
they need to be.  The gaffer, for example, is not terribly talkative
-- ask him about the movie and he'll say &quot;A job's a job,&quot; but ask him
about the lights and he has an opinion, as he should. Every character
has responses about the things they should know about, though if you
spend much time in conversations with them you will run afoul of the
game's time limit. The Marx brothers can tell you about each other,
the movie, MGM (Groucho says, &quot;MGM stands for 'more godless
movies.'&quot;), and anything else they ought to know about. Four in One
does an outstanding job juggling all these characters, giving them
just the appropriate depth of implementation so that the game really
rewards replay. After I had solved the game, I went back and just
chatted with the various characters, and was delighted with the extent
to which they are implemented. The author's research is quite apparent
in these moments, and it makes a big difference. Four In One taught me
things about the Marx Brothers that I had never known before, and made
me want to go out and rent A Night at the Opera again. That's
entertainment.

Rating: 8.7

If competition entries got individual awards, Four in One would have
to be recognized as the Greatest Sheer Effort. The game is simply
littered with NPCs--24 by my count, and considering the way the
characters wander in and out, I'm sure I missed at least a few. Some
of them essentially stand still (though all have some dialogue
potential), others have painfully complicated movement daemons, and
just thinking about what it took to code all of them made me want to
cry. (The source code is now available, but I haven't looked at it
yet. Perhaps some day when I'm feeling especially brave.)
Unfortunately, all that elaborate coding doesn't necessarily add up to
a rewarding game--though given how much time the author obviously put
into this, I certainly wish I could say it did.

The premise: you're &quot;Sam Wood,&quot; trying to put the finishing touches on
the latest Marx Brothers movie, and you're charged with the task of
assembling everyone on the set so that the last scene can be
filmed. Your clout as director only goes so far, however, and trying
to keep the brothers on the set long enough to film is, even for you,
like building a house out of Jello. You have a trusty sidekick who,
frankly, isn't much use, and the set is filled with extras and techies
and other actors. Egos being what they are, however, you don't seem to
be able to delegate the task of rounding up the brothers, and so you
scurry around the studio as if you were a lowly assistant.

Since the end of the competition, the cry regarding Four in One has
been fairly uniform: cute but too frustrating. The cry isn't wrong, as
such, but let's be clear about why it's frustrating: it's not because
there are a lot of NPCs to understand and manipulate. It's that so
much of the NPCs' behavior is random, as far as I can tell, that a
given game can be impossible to win if certain random events go
against you often enough. If two certain characters get in a fight,
for instance, another would leave, slowing down the rounding-up
process. Too many fights and you'd lose your power to gather people
together, for various reasons. I don't know whether the fights
happened at random or were related to some other factor, controllable
or not; if there was another factor, it was obscure enough that I
never caught on. Likewise, another character gets bored after a
certain amount of moves and wanders away--and if you don't get him to
do what he's supposed to do before that happens, you've wasted a
chance, and you don't have a lot to spare. To be sure, part of what
makes the game realistic is that the NPCs are not entirely malleable;
to that end, Four in One gets lots of realism points. Getting the
brothers to do what you want is, as someone said, like herding
cats. But all the realism points seem to come out of the fun column.

However, there's an upside to all this: there's lots of replayability
in Four in One, partly to find Easter eggs and partly because there's
lots of extraneous detail to sift through. Most of the characters
respond to a variety of questions--about the movie, other characters,
life, etc.  Because a winning game can vary so much--two different
games can present different challenges: solving the game once doesn't
guarantee that you'll be able to solve it on the next try. (Then
again, the random events might just not be on your side the next time,
as noted.) The game is consistently funny--Groucho has lots of good
one-liners, and Harpo has plenty of amusing antics, even if they
usually impede your progress. The thoroughness of the coding is not
limited to the NPC daemons--different characters have distinct
reactions when they enter certain rooms, for instance, and putting
certain characters in rooms together has unexpected results. In short,
so much of Four in One works so well that it seems rude to point out
that the game itself isn't always a lot of fun, at least if the player
is interested in achieving the goal the game presents. Most of the fun
to be had is extraneous to that goal.

In summary, Four in One reminded me of <a href = "t.html#tempest">Tempest</a> from the previous
year's competition--a brilliant idea, thoroughly and intelligently
done, that I wanted to like more than I did. And just as Four in One
arguably worked better as the transcript submitted to the IF Fan Fest,
so Tempest works better as, well, the play, and the literacy of the
attempt to translate it can't hide that. Four in One is quite a
testament to the author's skills; as a game, however, it's flawed, and
I gave it a 7.

This is quite an interesting concept, putting a new spin on
IF. Instead of the game being object-centric, it is NPC-centric, with
NO objects of any use what so ever, and more NPC's per square pixel
than any other game I have played, although most of them are thinly
implemented. But basically what happened is NPC's become gloryfied
objects. You are on a film set and only have four remaining takes to
complete a picture (hence the name), or you're out on your ear. The
film includes the four Marx Brothers, I've vaguely heard of Groucho
that's about it, and I thought there were only two. The problem is to
get all the stars and extras in the same place at the same this. To do
this you can TAKE people, to get them to follow you. The trouble is
they keep wandering off while you're finding the others ones,
sometimes after only one turn. There are, however, two NPC's who can
help you locate missing people. Most of the time actors tend to go to
the same places, but some won't follow without overs. Read the special
commands to see how to control them. I'm afraid I couldn't finish this
game, and suspect very very few people actually did.

VERSION: Release 1.2

The first edition of Neil deMause's <a href = "#frenetic">Frenetic Five</a>, a 1997 competition
entry, had its problems--the game didn't really have a good sense of
what to do with all your fellow superheroes--but it was also quite
funny; this episode works out the kinks inherent in giving the PC
multiple sidekicks, and it's even funnier than the original. The result,
while not a wildly ambitious effort, is well worth playing.

You are Improv, a MacGyveresque hero with a talent for making tools out
of common objects, and your team consists of Newsboy, who can instantly
provide a news update on any topic, Lexicon, who always knows the right
word, Clapper, who can find any missing object, and Pastiche, who has
assorted random powers (among them the power to sing lines from Top 40
songs relevant to almost any occasion). You can ask your sidekicks for
help at any time; you won't always get a hint from each of them, but
you'll usually get help in some form somewhere. Truth to tell, not
getting anywhere is at least as rewarding as making progress, since your
fellow superheroes have a wide range of amusing sarcastic responses.
Moreover, the ending encounter with the Mr. Redundancy Man of the title
is absolutely hilarious, mainly for the villain's dialogue: "Welcome to
my hideaway lair, my dear friends of mine! Your arrival has come
fortuitously just in time for you to witness the sight of my greatest
and most triumphal achievement!" The way you deal with him is clever,
but it's the premise itself that makes this worth playing--he has such a
wealth of amusingly repetitive dialogue that it's more entertaining to
find all the ways to interact with him than to set to work at solving
the puzzle.

Both the first and second Frenetic Five games draw much of their humor
from humdrum settings and tasks--i.e., you have superheroes riding the
bus and trying to operate a copy machine--and while it's amusing here,
as in the first one, the frustration aspect of wrestling with boring
objectives comes perilously close to being simply irritating.
Contributing to that problem is an unfortunate fellow named the
Validator, who comments on everything you do, as follows:

   >examine validator
   Some superheroes are blessed with a magnificent physique, like
   Backhoe Woman and The Human Hydraulic Press. Some have powers that
   are only dreamt of by regular humans, such as The Defenestrator and
   Microwave-Popcorn Boy. Some have neither, but are at least fun to be
   around and get invited to lots of parties. Then there's the
   Validator.

   The Validator says, "Outstanding! It never would have occurred to me
   to inspect the Validator!"

   >kick validator
   It's not clear how to kick the Validator.

   The Validator says, "Oh, kick the Validator, huh?  Great idea!"

You get the idea. It's not a bad joke, but it's not especially funny for
more than a few turns, and the typical player will end up spending more
than a few turns around this particular irritant. At any rate, the
Validator brings out the basic mundanity of the setting--there's nothing
that makes a setting seem quite so mundane as an irritating person
commenting on everything you do--as well as the ho-hum nature of your
powers, and those of your sidekicks. It's not every writer who could
make mundanity funny, but this one does. E.g.: "The clerk looks
thoughtful, in a manner that makes it clear that thought is not a usual
requirement of the job." 

The puzzles, by and large, are nothing special, with the exception of
the endgame puzzle, whose solution is a real "aha" moment. There's one
earlier puzzle that takes either a major logical leap or better
visualization skills than I have, but it's a relatively minor flaw,
particularly in a game this small. The second episode of this series
corrects the main flaw of the first one, namely that there was no
particular rhyme or reason to when your fellow superheroes would be able
to help you, and no standard way to ask them to intervene; here, "ask x
for help" elicits either action (solving a problem you couldn't solve on
your own) or some sort of response. It's not a perfect solution-- it's
still rarely obvious when you should be addressing a problem with your
own wits, in the manner of standard IF, and when you should be relying
on your team--but at least Episode Two doesn't require you to guess what
the other members of the team would do, which was the major flaw of the
first Frenetic Five. Having a standardized way to kick a puzzle out to
the rest of the gang makes things much easier.

There's not a lot to the second edition of Frenetic Five; it's solvable
in half an hour or so, and it doesn't do anything all that surprising.
But it has several laugh-out-loud moments, and fans of superheroes will
no doubt grin knowingly at the absurdity of it all.

Hah!

That was my repeated response as I played through Neil DeMause's second
installment in a series I hope he continues. The Frenetic Five vs. Mr.
Redundancy Man continues on in the humorous tradition that Mr. DeMause
started with his initial episode (<a href = "#frenetic">The Frenetic Five vs. Strum & Drang</a>),
and makes many improvements on that well-intentioned first episode to
boot. 

The Frenetic Five's world is covered with superheroes. As long as you
can do something mildly interesting (like, let's say, be forever
encouraging of someone else's actions), you've passed the minimum
requirements needed to play the part. In this respect, the Frenetic Five
pay more homage to the cartoon show The Tick (and its colorful cast of
superheroes like the cowardly Deflatomouse and the rain-man-like Urchin)
than it does to any team coming from the Marvel or DC universe. In fact,
you as the protagonist have no super power per se, just a love for the
TV show MacGyver and an ability to create things out of household
implements. Still, this makes you the perfect leader for your group of
misfits.

Although the writing and storyline are impressively well put together,
the best part about FF II are the NPCs. Considering the game is
approximately 4 rooms in size, the room-to-well-fleshed-out-NPC ratio is
pretty high. You've got the superhero named the Validator, the clerks,
and the villain from the title Mr. Redundancy Man. You've also got your
teammates, who form your moral support network, and who are hilarious
with their witty banter and comments when it comes time to use their
"super powers". My personal favorite team member is Lexicon, who's
essentially a walking, talking version of Microsoft Bookshelf. That is
to say, he's got the right word for what's troubling you.

[Reviewer's Note: Lexicon actually got me all teary-eyed and nostalgic
for one of the oddest little superheroes to ever come out of the Marvel
comic book universe. His name was Cypher, and he was a member of a group
called the New Mutants (a sort of Junior X-Men squad). His superpower:
the ability to translate any language! As you can well imagine he was
used sparingly. I can just picture it now. The New Mutants are getting
ready to attack Magneto's secret hideout and the call to action goes
something like this...

<< OK Magik, you attack the flank with your magic bolts. Cannonball, you
soar in from the clouds and weaken his defenses. Sunspot, we'll send you
in through the front door because after all, you're super-strong. And
Cypher, you stay behind and make sure no one unplugs the fridge. Those
beers have GOT to be cold when we get back! >>]

Like all the NPCs, Lexicon's "help" in solving puzzles was well
implemented and his super weakness (the equivalent to Superman's
kryptonite), left me laughing for a long time after it was revealed.

The NPCs not only add to the comic flavor of the game, but also provide
you with clues if you need them, thereby providing a built-in hint
system that doesn't break mimesis. In fact, if you're feeling
particularly unimaginative when it comes time for you to solve some
puzzles, the team can act as your "walkthrough" provided you ask the
right team member the right questions. (However, this is obviously not
recommended as it decreases the overall enjoyment of the game).

There are essentially two types of puzzles in the game. The first type
includes puzzles where you have to employ your MacGyver-like abilities,
and the second revolve around correctly using your team's "talents" to
get out of situations. As I'd mentioned previously, every team member
has a hand in solving one puzzle or another, but figuring out which one
you need isn't always apparent without a little thought. (This was
especially true of Pastiche, as I had forgotten her special abilities
from the first game in the series). The fact that the puzzles tend to be
a bit tougher (or maybe more correctly, not necessarily intuitive right
off the bat), is actually a positive as it helps out with the pacing of
the game. 

Pacing, you say? What does pacing have to do with anything? Well, let me
explain. When smaller games have really simple puzzles, it's almost too
easy to progress through them without paying much attention to the
"buzz" in the background (i.e., funny non-default responses, snarky
comebacks, etc.). I know a lot of authors who have gone to great lengths
to "flesh out" their game environment only to realize that players end
up missing most of the extra goodies because there was no motivation to
experience them. One game in particular that comes to mind is Suzanne
Britton's <a href = "w.html#worlds">Worlds Apart</a>.

I can remember playing Worlds Apart and thoroughly enjoying it the first
time. What I hadn't realized was how many subtleties there were in the
game until Suzanne posted something on r.g.i-f regarding the richness of
the world she had created. With her post in hand, I played Worlds Apart
a second time and enjoyed it even more than I had the first. The point
is, that if Worlds Apart had one tiny little flaw, it was that Suzanne
didn't slow us down enough to smell the roses if we didn't really want
to, and I know that I for one ended up missing some of the best parts of
the game as a result.

In FF II, the obstacles DeMause puts in front of you should slow you
down enough to hear the "buzz" (specifically the witty banter from the
game's NPCs, and some hilarious object descriptions), and get a real
feel for the warped world your character lives in. This should add
immensely to the game and the player's gaming experience as a whole. 
 
The ending is too funny for words, and will leave the player feeling
satisfied even if he had to use the built-in walkthrough to achieve it.
There is no way for the PC to die, and with the exception of one nasty
little bug (which should be avoidable for most players) there's no way
to get the game into an unwinnable situation. Even if you're not a big
comic book fan, I would still highly recommend this one as a nice
diversion on a day when you need a good laugh.

VERSION: Release 2 (1997 competition release)

Here's my confession: I love superheroes. Ever since my first Marvel
comic at age six, I've always been a fan. Even now, well into my
twenties and possessing a Master's degree in English Lit, I still make
sure I get my monthly superhero fix. Yes, I know that violent revenge
power-fantasies do not great works of literature make. Yes, I love
comics and I know that the comics market is overcrowded, to the
exclusion of other quality works, with bulging musclemen in tight
spandex. Yes, I know that the constant deaths and resurrections of the
superhero set strain plausibility to the breaking point. (Though
really, who cares about plausibility? We're talking superheroes,
here!) And yes, I'm disturbed by the almost grotesquely idealized
bodies (especially women's bodies) relentlessly depicted in superhero
comics. But what can I say? No matter how guilty it gets, it's still a
pleasure.

Consequently, I was anxious to start playing The Frenetic Five, and
gave a small cheer when Comp97's magic shuffler put it towards the
front of the line. I've always thought that the whole superhero genre
would make a great one for IF -- if it's a great power fantasy to
watch some comicbook character shoot fire out of his hands, how much
greater to actually play the character that does it! I quickly learned
that FF is in fact a superhero spoof (seems that very few people who
think of themselves as sophisticated can enter the superhero genre
without wearing the bulletproof bracelets of satire and ridicule), and
a very funny one too, in the tradition of Superguy. You play Improv,
whose power is the ingenious use of household objects, and other
members of your team include a boy who can see tomorrow's headlines,
and a woman who can find lost objects by clapping her hands (named, of
course, The Clapper). The prose maintains a consistently high quality,
from the characters' dialogue with one another to the snappy responses
provided for some unlikely actions (&quot;>GET HOUSE&quot; brings &quot;You can count
the number of superheroes you know who can lift an entire house on one
finger: Forklift Man. (Come to think of it, Forklift Man could lift an
entire house with one finger.)&quot;) It's hilarious.

Sadly, there are some problems as well. First of all, I was disappointed
that my supposed super-power was not implemented, as it would have been
one of the most natural (and coolest) hint systems ever devised. Anytime I
needed help with a puzzle, I could have just drawn on my &quot;super Improv
power&quot; to help me make the intuitive connections between those ordinary
household objects. Instead, the game left me to hope that I (as a player)
developed those MacGyver talents on my own. Not likely, I'm afraid. In
addition, the game does not meet the challenge of allowing me to use even
this setup, because it does not allow alternate solutions to puzzles by
using objects in unconventional ways. Very few alternate solutions were
implemented, and few are even anticipated with a snarky response. For
example, when tied up, I tried many unconventional ways to escape my bonds
(cut them with my shard of glass, put eyeglasses into sunlight to focus
the light into enough heat to burn the ropes, blow on the eyeglasses to
put them in the right place, bite the ropes, wrap duct tape on my fingers
to get more than one object at a time, etc.) Each attempt was met with one
of two (equally lame) responses: either very clumsy non-recognition of the
verb (&quot;You can't see any bite here.&quot;) or &quot;That's not really possible in
your current state.&quot; The game doesn't really account for all the clever
things that could be done with the inventory objects provided, just the
*one* clever thing that will solve each puzzle.

Finally, there are a number of just plain bugs in the game, which
always decreases the fun factor. The Frenetic Five has an excellent
premise and, on the level of prose, an excellent execution. However,
interface design and implementation are too important to be treated
the way this game treats them, and it suffers for it. I'm still
waiting for the game that does superheroes just right.

Prose: As mentioned above, the prose is excellent throughout the
game. The dialogue and characterization for each member of the team is
sharp and funny, and room descriptions (which adapted somewhat to the
character's mental state) are both concise and vivid. Even some of the
most everyday IF responses are considerably enlivened by the superhero
treatment -- for example, saying &quot;Down&quot; in a locale where that
direction is not available evokes the response &quot;Sadly, you're not
equipped with the ability to tunnel through solid ground.&quot;

Plot: The plot is basically pretty middle-of-the-road superhero
cliche.  Since this is a spoof, of course, cliches are a good thing,
and many of the touches (like having to take the bus to the
supervillains' hideout) are quite funny. The landscape, the premise
(SuperTemps, whose logo is a muscled forearm holding a timesheet), and
the spoofing of venerable superhero tropes (a mission interrupts
relaxation, the villains explain their nefarious scheme to the bound
heroes, etc.) are all very cleverly done. There were some coincidences
which strained even the generous boundaries of satire, but I'll
discuss those below.

Puzzles: In fact, I'll just discuss them right here. The puzzles are a
weaker part of this game. I found basically two types of puzzles in
the game. One group is the puzzle based on extremely contrived
circumstances -- for example, the door to the villains' hideout uses a
&quot;guess-the-big-word&quot; lock, and what do you know, I happen to have
someone on my team whose superpower is guessing big words! Lucky me!
The other type of puzzle is supposed to have drawn on my character's
superpower, the ingenious use of household objects. However, since
this power wasn't implemented (as a hint system) within the game, I
was left to think of these ingenious uses by myself, the problems of
which have already been discussed above.

Technical:
writing -- I found no errors in grammar or spelling in this game.

coding -- I think the main failure of the coding was the one I've
already discussed: the lack of depth in coding alternative uses for
inventory items. When a game's main character is someone whose primary
trait is the ingenious use of objects, it is incumbent on that game to
provide specific code for as many of those ingenious uses as possible.
Frenetic Five falls well short in this regard. The game also had a few
regular bugs, which I assume will be fixed in the post-competition
version.

OVERALL: 6.3

Among all the wander-around-an-ordinary-place-doing-ordinary-things
entries in the 1997 competition, perhaps the most enjoyable is Friday
Afternoon, a short tour of the author's office. Though the puzzles
aren't really anything special, they have few obvious flaws, and most
impart an air of whimsy that makes this feel reasonably fresh.

Perhaps the most notable thing in Friday Afternoon is a development
right at the beginning of the game -- your glasses break, and you have
to find a means of fixing them despite your limited vision. The
solution itself is not particularly hard or innovative, true, but
Mr. Schweitzer shows admirable thoroughness in concealing the office
behind a blur until the problem is solved. The problem is vaguely
reminiscent of one from <a href = "w.html#wishbringer">Wishbringer</a>, though that was an absolute bar
on vision rather than a reduction -- but it did draw me into the game
effectively enough, much more than the average conventional-task game
tends to. My only problem with that part of the game, really, was that
the solution came too easily; I wanted to have to rely on other
senses, follow a complicated pattern, something, but the payoff was a
bit mundane.

After that, Friday Afternoon becomes fairly conventional, though
enlivened by a good deal of wit; one of your co-workers has responses
that echo those of the hacker in <a href = "l.html#lurk">Lurking Horror</a>, for one thing, and
the solution to the problem of looking up a phone number is
entertainingly zany. (At least, zany in a bored-and-
trapped-in-an-office way.) The only puzzle that really breaks IF rules
is one involving repeated actions without the first few failures being
clued -- i.e., the player might give up after a try or two, since the
responses don't indicate that you're getting any closer.  With some
tinkering on that -- feedback that changes, some reason to believe
that pursuing that course will lead you to the goal -- the puzzles
would be fine.

A secondary but just as significant problem in Friday Afternoon
involves a certain calendar and what it assumes about you, the player
-- namely, that you're a straight male who enjoys having pictures of
women in tight clothes in your office. While this certainly doesn't do
anything for the game, in my eyes, the sexism involved isn't so
painfully blatant that it's offensive; I found it a bit annoying, I
suppose. (When I played this one, I had already encountered &quot;Leaves&quot;
and its much more juvenile example of the same problem.) I don't think
that the existence of the calendar in the game is itself wrong, but
there are a few lines that could be better put -- namely, in a
description, you're told that it's from August 1997, &quot;but that isn't
what you're looking at, is it?&quot; And elsewhere, when you find a note
indicating that the company's female employees are offended, you smile
and note that the management won't see the calendar in its current
location. No, not outrageous, but still a little obnoxious on both
counts. Imputing thoughts or feelings to a player can be very
effective when well done, but these aren't thoughts or feelings that
are really worth imputing, given the assumptions involved. My feeling
is that the calendar should still serve its purpose in the game -- but
that the suggestion that it, er, does whatever it does for you should
be removed.  (And, I must say, the answer to &quot;read calendar&quot; is quite
amusing.)

Some have objected on similar grounds to the central premise of the
game -- you need to get out of your office by 6:00 lest you miss your
date with Tanya, and your date with Tanya is particularly important
because you want to prove to yourself and to the world that you're not
a nerd. Not a particularly noble reason for going on a date with her,
true, but the game doesn't say that it's the sole reason or that you
have no actual feelings for Tanya, merely that you feel like a nerd
and are tired of that feeling.  My feeling was that this is simple
tell-it-like-it-is; for many people, going on a date -- either the
first one ever or the first one in a long time -- serves as ego
reinforcement, a sign that you're attractive, interesting, etc. It
isn't particularly fair to the other party involved if that's the only
reason, but the interests of comedy here; it's not as funny, somehow,
if you're anxious about missing your date because you're desperately
in love, and this is supposed to be comic, not tragic.

All that said, there are plenty of things to enjoy here, notably an
&quot;Easter Egg Hunt&quot; in the hint menu that gives the player interesting
things to try -- with a prize in the form of the original release of
the game. I didn't find many of the Easter Eggs involved -- though I
wouldn't mind getting a push, particularly for &quot;re-creating a scene
from The Graduate&quot;. There is plenty of deadpan humor in the writing,
for example when you try to move a stack of boxes and get this: &quot;You'd
rather not do anything with it: you might hurt yourself if it all fell
on top of you, and you don't want to go on a date with Tanya with
band-aids all over your face.&quot; Or a reference to a desk as &quot;taking up
space,&quot; to which the author adds &quot;(Much like Marc's job description,
from all you've seen him do.)&quot; The view of your co-workers is
consistently amusing, even if they're a bit stereotyped; the sugarcube
is a very funny take on office boredom.

Though there isn't a lot about Friday Afternoon that will stay with
the player, the author should get credit for not doing much
wrong. Using the phone, admittedly, requires fairly specific syntax,
and the scoring system -- where you get ten points for significant
tasks, but one routine action gets one point -- is a bit odd. But the
game is entirely free of grammar problems (the author is Dutch, though
it's not clear what his familiarity with English is). There's a time
limit, though it's sufficiently loose that you really have to be lost
to run afoul of it -- but it does provide some measure of tension, the
puzzles work the way they're supposed to, and the whole thing's done
with a measure of humor. I gave this one an 8 on the competition
scale.

VERSION: 4

Back in 1996, the Internet IF community was just beginning to take off.
The second IF competition had been even more successful than the first,
and experimental works were just starting to appear. Still, the majority
of the IF produced at this time was either an Infocom tribute or
followed the style of an Infocom game. Frobozz Magic Support is a case
in point. If the title doesn't make this obvious, this is one of the
many games to pay tribute to the <a href = "z.html#zorktril">Zork</a>/<a href = "e.html#enchanttril">Enchanter</a> games. In fact, it is as
if the author was thinking "let's see. References to the Flatheads?
Check. Appearance of the Implementors? Check. Game can be made
unwinnable by doing actions in the wrong order? Check. Really annoying
maze? Check." The only things missing were a sleep timer and starvation
puzzle. Well, perhaps the maze would be regarded as creative by some.
Let me put it this way, if you enjoyed the maze in the 2002 competition
entry called <a href = "e.html#evacuate">Evacuate</a>, you will be thrilled with this one. I didn't care
for either maze. However, as old-school IF, this really isn't as bad as
I made it sound. For one thing, the story is original. You are a novice
support clerk who goes on calls to help people out of the jams they get
themselves into when magic doesn't quite work like it should. This, plus
the numerous references to blorple and all the cubes gives me the
impression that this is supposed to be taking place at the same time as
<a href = "s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</a>. One of the problems you fix, for example, is an Enchanter
who has turned himself into a shark with the Snavig spell. The spell
won't wear off. Similarly, your companion is a burin that got animated
with a malyon spell. Once again, the spell doesn't want to wear off.
Perhaps this was the beginnings of the failure of magic which resulted
in the great conclave in Borphee.

Unfortunately, Frobozz Magic Support doesn't do as much with this plot
as I thought it should. Like much older IF, the plot is mostly an excuse
for puzzles. The puzzles vary from creative to annoying. As I mentioned,
it is easy to silently make the game unwinnable if you don't do things
in the correct order. On top of this, the hint system in the game is the
worst I've ever seen. I've never programmed in TADS, but apparently,
hint systems of any kind are quite difficult to design in that language.
I say this because I rarely see a good hint system in TADS. This one is
nothing more than a dump of all the hints, which are rather vague. You
have no control over what gets shown. You type "hint" and get about two
screens worth of little clues. I would have preferred that it be
context-sensitive or at least present a simple menu. The other option is
to type "walkthrough" which spits out a list of commands which will win
the game. Neither was very satisfying. I suggest that if you must resort
to hints, download the solution from the if-archive at
<a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/solutions/frobozz.sol">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/solutions/frobozz.sol</a>. It explains
the logic of the puzzles and is divided into sections. I ended up having
to look at this solution more than I care to admit because after I
discovered how easy it was to make the game unwinnable, I wanted to make
sure I wasn't doing anything to ruin the game. These elements really
surprised me because in Mr. Cull's later <a href = "g.html#glowgrass">Glowgrass</a>, they are largely
absent. Also, in his interview after the 1997 competition, he talked
about how much he disliked puzzles of the very type he programmed in
Frobozz Magic Support. As I said, he seemed to be making a conscious
effort to emulate Infocom to the point that he ended up exaggerating it
a bit.

The bottom line is this: if you are a big Enchanter fan, and don't mind
the type of game which will require a few restarts, give this one a
shot. If you were introduced to IF with Photopia and don't know Belboz
from Krill, forget it.

You're working late one night in the university computer lab when you
notice that everyone around you has suddenly stopped what they were
doing.  Closer investigation reveals that your fellow students and
professors have all been immobilized by some mysterious force.
Perhaps that odd machine in the gradate students' lab could offer an
explanation...?

My first impression of this game was that it was strongly influenced
by &quot;<a href = "l.html#lurk">The Lurking Horror</a>&quot; -- the setting and early descriptions were
very reminiscent of Infocom's tribute to Lovecraft.  &quot;Frozen&quot; is
obviously a first attempt with Inform, containing numerous, albeit
rather insignificant, bugs (such as being able to find objects by
searching for them a second time), missing line-feeds in obvious
places, a score that's always 0 out of 0 (is that good or bad?) and
other nuances that give the impression of an unpracticed I-F
programmer.

These will hopefully be fixed as the author makes progress with the
development system, because I see a lot of promise from his first
work.  &quot;Frozen&quot; sports three, count 'em, THREE different conclusions
to the story, a prominent plus in my book (&quot;<a href = "p.html#path">The Path to Fortune</a>&quot; also
features a trinity of endings).  Occasional bits of writing are easily
on par with &quot;Lurking Horror&quot; and the game has a genuinely mysterious
feel throughout.

Perhaps a bit too mysterious, in fact.  My primary gripe about
&quot;Frozen&quot; is the complete lack of resolution to the game's bizarre
circumstances.  Aside from the curious last-minute addition to the
machine in the lab, no attempt at an explanation is even made.  Why
exactly did the students freeze up?  Why wasn't I affected?  How did
my experiences act to reverse it?  What exactly was that sphere on the
machine, and why was it added?  Whose body was that, burned at the
stake?  Two of the endings seem to suggest that everything was a
dream, but all three of them are quite vague.

Don't read this the wrong way -- unanswered questions fit in well with
this type of story, and I like having to make educated guesses to put
things together (and I'm a huge fan of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, where the
writers frequently and intentionally leave the loose ends for viewers
to tie up), but I was hoping the author would give me a little more
background to work with in this particular case.  Perhaps the dust
spirit could have offered a few clues, or perhaps there could have
been more information about the graduate project.

At any rate, I enjoyed &quot;Frozen&quot;.  Its size (the object code is only
about 64K) would have made it a perfect short work for the
Competition, but perhaps Jeremy Farnham is working on something else
even as we speak...

Future Boy! Is the first commercial project developed with the HUGO-engine,
written by HUGO&#8217;s creator Kent Tessman. As expected, it is flawless with 
regard to programming and parsing and it is a convincing proof of HUGO&#8217;s 
power. But what is more important, it is one of the best games I have 
played in years.

The story: Even though the title suggests otherwise, you are not Future 
Boy, but his roommate. Nevertheless, it is up to you to save the city from 
the evil supervillain Clayton Eno. To minimize spoilers, let me just say 
that the plot takes many interesting and surprising turns and is 
beautifully designed. Plus, you meet very interesting characters, some 
friends, some foes, some something else. As in any good action comic (or 
movie, by the way) the pace quickens towards the end. At the same time, the 
difficulty of the puzzles rises, thus stretching the suspense to a maximum 
(unless you use the in-built hint system prematurely). The game features 
congenial graphics, animation sequences and music bits. Cartoonish in 
style, they add to the superhero flair effectively, but they are neither 
necessary nor helpful for advancing in the game. So the enjoyment doesn&#8217;t 
suffer too much on a system without graphic support (e.g. Palm). The voice 
acting deserves special praise: it is amazingly well done and very 
professional. I didn&#8217;t discover any major flaws worth mentioning.

The game itself has a linear structure, which means there are no 
alternative endings and the plot doesn&#8217;t develop in different directions 
depending on the player&#8216;s actions. In the beginning,  there is always only 
one puzzle at hand to be solved to advance the story. In the middle game, 
the structure becomes much more open and the player can decide which puzzle 
to try next, so he doesn&#8217;t get stuck that easy. The level of difficulty 
starts very moderate, so even the unpracticed (or untalented) puzzle solver 
will advance easily and get motivated to try to solve the later, more 
difficult puzzles by himself as well. This later puzzles get pretty hard 
and multi-layered, but are always fair, solvable and well provided with 
clues.

There are two features of the game I would like to see in every future text 
adventure: a "goal" command which tells you what (basically) to do next and 
a short summary of what happened so far after each restore. 

So, I really recommand the game to anyone who likes superhero stories, good 
puzzles and/or good text adventures in general. It is not cheap, but worth 
the price (although I wouldn&#8217;t order the deluxe package again, which is 5 $ 
more for a common CD case and a four page booklet).
