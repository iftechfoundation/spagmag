VERSION: Release 3

Once upon a time there was this guy in Greece -- ancient Greece, that is -- who
set fire to some very important temple (Athena, maybe?). The reason why he did 
so was simple: He wanted to be famous. What did the other Greeks do? They forbid
any mention of the incendiary's name. They condemned him to oblivion. That's 
what the title of the game, Damnatio Memoriae, means. And that's what the player 
must avoid in it: To be forgotten.

No, that's not true. The game's real goal is not to get caught by your enemies,
as in any other game. Posterity is secondary. Let's say it's a plus. I don't
think that's a flaw, but I would've liked a *** You have died ***-like message
every time you had managed to survive but not to save your memory from
destruction. I would've liked to see a game where your life wasn't the most
important thing at stake. (Has a game like that ever been written? One where the
last message would be *** You have died, but you have won ***?) Also, I would've
liked to read some thoughts on the subject of fame and posterity, because the
story really had potential for that.

Damnatio Memoriae shares a similar design pattern with Galatea. In the latter,
the reactions of the NPC depended on several variables, and the ending was the
verbal expression of the final values of those variables. Here you have your 
life and your fame. And the ending depends on the final values of both. This 
always reminds me of this Japanese show, Takeshi's Castle, where participants 
were put inside a giant ball and thrown down through what looked like a 
Tartaglia's triangle pinball. The outcome depended on whether they fell on safe 
or death spots. With this system, it doesn't really matter if you choose A or B, 
because the result is the same. Only the value of the variables change. Also, 
you can end up taking the B path even if you had chosen A earlier.

My own storytelling concept is quite different. I think of interactive stories 
as trees. And trees are nothing but lists with a common root. So, interactive 
stories are a bunch of different linear stories that, depending on the player's 
choices can lead to lots of different endings. I find games designed like this 
easier to write and to plan, and more human, because it lets the story evolve 
almost without constraints. Doing things the other way seems confusing to me.

And now that I'm dealing with theoretical aspects, let me mention a detail that 
I consider a wrong way of doing things. If you have already played Damnatio 
Memoriae and the ending ever caught you in the other location, you'll have 
noticed that you're brought back to the original room and offered again a full 
description of it. The reason why I think this is wrong is because it breaks the 
rhythym of the narration. I'm not talking about this particular game or about 
the author, but about the system that produced it. Why are Inform games 
organized by location instead of being organized by sequence? Remember the 
opening sequence of Touch of Evil? Why can't IF games do things like that? Let's 
suppose you have this PC who's talking with a friend while walking down the 
street. Are you going to interrupt the conversation every time they
turn a corner? Let's suppose you have a PC who's being chased by the police. Are 
you going to interrupt the chase every time the player types E or S to offer a 
boring description that nobody would care about at that particular moment? If 
games were organized by sequence, only each one's opening location's description 
would be offered and the rest could then be simply asked for. To me this makes a 
lot more sense, and also leaves freedom to the author to write a narrative text 
and make the story advance instead of offering a description that's always more 
or less the same.

But, finally, the good news. I liked the game. Really. I did. It was short, so 
it didn't get boring. Actually, when I reached the ending for the first time I 
thought: Hey,this is it? I want more. Also, it was easier than most of her other 
games. By easier, I mean the interaction was easier. For example, in Savoir 
Faire the non-standard verbs drove me crazy. It was like watching one of those 
pretentious B/W indie movies. It's not me the one who has to adapt to your 
style, it's you to mine, stupid filmmaker! But in this case, I liked the story 
(I love the Romans) and I could take the time to learn how the special commands 
worked, because the learning gave almost immediate results. Also, I think it is 
Emily's best written game.

[Final note: Oh. In case anyone was thinking: You uneducated freak! It was the 
temple of...! And the guy's name was...! I know perfectly well who the temple 
was dedicated to, and who the incendiary was, and even the exact date when that 
happened, but I'm not doing him a favour even by giving you hints about him.]

NAME: Dangerous Curves
AUTHOR: Irene Callaci
EMAIL: icallaci SP@G csupomona.edu
DATE: June 2000
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-machine interpreters
AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/curves.z8">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/curves.z8</a>
VERSION: Release 8

This game's been on my mind a while. I just can't shake it. She's 
like a five-martini hangover that just won't go away.

For just about any subgenre of IF, in general, if you wait long enough
you will eventually see a game that "nails" the subgenre. For those of
you groaning, I assure you that (1) this review is not entirely ranting
if-crit, and (2) not a total slobber-fest proclamation that Dangerous
Curves is the best detective IF ever made. But let's face it, sometimes
a game comes along which makes it really hard for others to stake a
claim in the same subgenre for years afterward. And so, when I started
playing D.C., a significant question in my mind was "Has the private
detective storyline (as IF) been beaten to death (long) before Dangerous
Curves came along?" The short transcript to this question (in a more
polite form, perhaps) might be:

>  Is this the game that "nails shut" mystery IF for at least
>  the next few years?

Not quite.

>  Well, does this game add anything to that subgenre that
>  feels really fresh?

Here and there, yes.

>  Does D.C. at least provide a satisfying reward as a
>  competent, mainstream stab at a subgenre that some
>  might say is already fairly well populated?

Absolutely! I can't say so loudly enough. A perfect example to typify my
case is the description for one of the prime female characters and
suspects:

   >x jessica
   Tall, blonde, and cool as a martini at five o'clock. Legs that begin
   somewhere down around Cape Horn and don't quit till they reach the
   Northwest Territories. The type of woman other women despise. The
   type every man falls for. Once.

Ok, look, it's not grand innovation on the detective strain, but can you
argue that it fails to ante up on the promise of what Chandler, Sam
Spade, and Easy Rawlins might deliver?

What I believe makes IF so well suited for mystery is that the most
tried and true prologues are of the amnesiac genre (e.g. "You wake up in
a small white room, noticing that your skull has sustained a sharp blow.
Ears ringing, you hobble to the door to find it locked before noticing
the small trace of blood on your hospital gown."). This game plays into
that theme nicely, with the private eye appropriately grasping at straws
early on, and building up his case slowly and naturally.

Which brings us to the question of plot. Does it live up? My answer is,
"Almost." As far as it goes, I can't criticize the plotting itself, per
se. The game grinds out as a pretty decent clue-finding exercise for a
while, followed by figuring out just how to corner the culprit. The
trouble isn't that the plot doesn't hold together, nor that there are
non-intuitive moments, big gaps, or ridiculous leaps that the player
must make. The problem, if there is one, is that the storyline winds up
more linear and compact than the player will imagine it should be. Based
on the first scene, I would have expected more deceptive twists and
turns as I sifted my way through the clues. In literary terms, this
basically fleshes out a novella, after the opening moments seem to have
promised a full-length novel. Imagine seeing the first hour of the movie
"Chinatown", and not the full version. A great half of a movie. Really
great. Abbreviated in form, minus much of the intrigue of the real deal.
But ask yourself, when it comes to IF, how many other works have
successfully addressed this?

Besides the plot, there are a pile of little features and touches that
make this game more enjoyable, and which should be emulated by others:
   - Use of keys is handled automatically (no fumbling for the right one
     outside a locked door.)
   - There is an in-game notepad. This can be used to avoid mapping the
     whole world, or for any other data you want to store there.
   - The GO TO <LOCATION> command further obviates the need for
     extensive mapping, and smoothly handles operation of your car.
   - The in-game hint system is particularly clever, amusing, adaptive
     to your progress, and seamless with the plot. All at once.

Those are just gimmicks, though. You may be wondering what it IS that
makes this game take up the maximal 512K storage of an overstuffed z8
game file. The answer is that the author decided to implement a boodle's
worth of stuff that other authors would have considered mere
distraction. In short, Irene went a-world-buildin', and did a mostly
fine job of it, with a medium-to-large number of locations which each
have their fair share of fully implemented items. And, for the most
part, all of this mess interacts with all the other mess pretty well.
Honestly, how many other IF-towns have you been to recently that had
functioning offices, police stations, newsrooms, libraries, service
stations, hospitals, bars, pawnshops, apartments, cars, restaurants,
banks, etc. Of course, it's all under the illusion of
man-behind-the-curtain "functioning", but that's the point. There's even
good IF-style humor lurking behind many of the stock answers that grease
the wheels behind each the scenes of the functioning world-spaces
(example here from the pawnshop):

   >kiss earl
   Earl works out at the local gym a couple times a week. You don't.

   >hit earl
   Earl works out at the local gym a couple times a week. You don't.

   >break display case
   Rumor has it Earl once killed a man for less.

You get the picture.

Naturally, there are exceptions. Like many games with mandatory sleeping
and eating, there are annoyances when you haven't really played along
correctly. I tend to explore the locations of a large game pretty
randomly at first, without solving puzzles (when I can actually get away
with it), and that's hard with sleeping/eating games. And, of course,
there is the money handling algorithm, which attempts to help you out by
avoiding the need for counting your change too precisely. Some players
will agree, and some won't. This shakes out as pretty minor,
fortunately.

In all, Irene should be lauded for her example of solid top-to-bottom
game design. Even better, the spit and polish make the player feel like
they are inside a game with has a complete, all-around feel to it. Like
a good DVD that has plenty of extras and good packaging, Dangerous
Curves has all the right finishing touches (short of hard-copy feelies)
that give it a near-professional quality.

Returning to the point at which this review began, let's just take a
second to survey the scope of private eye IF that has come before, to
better put in context how this game should now be judged. Previous IF
mysteries include Infocom's <a href = "w.html#witness">Witness</a> and <a href = "d.html#deadline">Deadline</a>, <a href = "g.html#gumshoe">Gumshoe</a>, and most
recently <a href = "g.html#guilty">Guilty Bastards</a>. Given its recentness and degree of similarity,
I assert that Guilty Bastards is a key reference point. From my view,
G.B. is a competent and engaging mystery. It set a mark for all-around
quality as the flagship game of the Hugo system, but didn't quite impose
a moratorium on detective IF. If you will allow me a little license: We
might say that while the movie {game} Usual Suspects {Guilty Bastards}
rejuvenated the atrophying subgenre of suspense {mystery} movies {IF},
and raised the bar, there was and is still room for artistic success by
others. Take a look at L.A. Confidential or Talented Mr. Ripley
{Dangerous Curves}.

Given the thirst for larger, longer, non-comp games Irene has to be
greatly praised for producing an enjoyable, well-integrated game of this
size.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag22.html">SPAG #22</a> -- September 15, 2000

NAME: Dark Mage
AUTHOR: Greg Troutman
EMAIL: unknown
DATE: 1997
PARSER: N/A - written in assembly
SUPPORTS: Atari 2600
AVAILABILITY: Software is freeware. Cartridge for sale for $25.
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/atari-8bit/dm.bin">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/atari-8bit/dm.bin</a>

Dark Mage is a unique work. Using bank-switching to achieve the needed
resolution, it is a complete implementation of an original text
adventure within an 8k Atari 2600 program. The creator has gone on to
release a graphical Atari 2600 game, This Planet Sucks. When I tried
Dark Mage a few years ago using an emulator, the emulated display was
the thing that sucked. It was so nauseatingly flickering that even those
with a strong stomach for fuzzy, flickering text would have trouble.

For those who wish to play Dark Mage, I strongly recommend using an
actual Atari 2600. It can be played using the Starpath Supercharger, a
device which fits in the cartridge slot and can be loaded with new games
via a 1/8" audio jack. (The Supercharger originally was used to load
games from cassette tapes.) Sound files in .wav format are available
from non-IF-Archive sources online, ready for use with the Supercharger.
Also online are the .bin ROM image and (again, at other sites) the
source code for an early 4k version of the game. The other way to play
Dark Mage on the 2600 itself is to purchase a cartridge for $25, from
Hozer Video Games. [<a href = "http://www.netway.com/~hozervideo">http://www.netway.com/~hozervideo</a> --Paul]

Any screen of text displayed in Dark Mage, either responding to actions
or to describing an area, can have at most nine lines. Each line can be
at most twelve characters wide. Before the first room description
appears, there is a four-screen introductory sequence:

AS JESTER 
TO KING 
ROLAND THE 
INSANE, 
YOU'VE KNOWN 
BETTER DAYS

-

BANISHED!

-

JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAD TOO
MUCH TO
DRINK

-

AND LOST THE 
BLACK ROSE 
OF THE REALM 
IN A CARD 
GAME AGAINST 
NEONORE,THE 
DARK MAGE...

Then the player is greeted with:

YOU ARE ON A
HILLTOP

There are few possibilities at this point. The rubber-coated black
joystick can be manipulated to indicate a direction or (if left in the
center) "LOOK" for a longer description. After LOOKing, there are an
additional few actions possible: GO (returning to the directional
options), TAKE, GIVE, USE, TALK, INVENTORY. TALK is not transitive, and
neither is TAKE. GIVE and USE allow the player to choose objects from
inventory. Often the actions are not productive or fun, and when they
succeed it is often in an unexpected way. This unexpected success of
commands can sometimes frustrate, but it works to the advantage of Dark
Mage at times. In one memorable case, a very funny <a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy</a> reference unexpectedly appears.

The final solution to the game is a good one, appropriate to the jester
protagonist. Even with screens smaller than a haiku, Dark Mage shows
that it is possible to create puzzles that work with the accompanying
story elements and reinforce the overall tone of the work.

Having contemplated doing IF works for the GameBoy, a powerful platform
by comparison, Dark Mage was of special interest. The game did reveal
that (aside from the technological strong-man freak-show value of an
endeavor like this) there are at least a few pleasures to be had in an
extremely spare form. These stemmed mostly from the unusual replies,
with less thrill provided by puzzle-solving. In many places, the
quickest path through solution space may be the exhaustive search
approach: simply doing everything in every location to try to advance.
The occasionally witty subversion of my action into something wacky
provided a good moment here and there, but it was not enough to make
Dark Mage a really fun experience overall. It remains of interest as a
retrocomputing curiosity -- and, to some extent, as a way to learn about
the essence of IF by looking to the least ornamented, most simple
examples.

VERSION: Release 1

I came to Dastardly with pretty low expectations. I had never before played
a game from 24 Hours of Inform, the contest for which this game was 
written. I was expecting something not much better than a SpeedIF game. 
What I got instead was a game that has much to admire in its atmosphere and 
character development, although it does have a particularly serious flaw.

The third 24 Hours of Inform contest had two basic rules: write a game in 
24 hours, and set the game in a theatre, featuring a petticoat, an 
advertisement, something which is repainted, and a trapdoor. These 
requirements led Andy Chase to set his game in a financially troubled 
theatre in Victorian London. Your are an ambitious playwright, while your 
financial backer, James, has ruined your hopes by turning your theatre into 
a burlesque house while he indulges in excesses of drink and flesh.

In the "about" menus for this game, Andy Chase says that Dastardly probably 
contains a lot of historical inaccuracies. Maybe, but I didn't notice any. 
In fact, I really liked the game's setting and atmosphere. Another thing I 
liked was the extent to which its characters were developed, far more than 
I would have expected in a speed-written game. You may not be able to talk 
to James much during the opening segment, but you can read your journal to 
gain insight into him, yourself, and others. Before you are done exploring 
the theatre, you have a fairly good idea of what you must do, and why.

Unfortunately, this game has a serious bug that prevented me from being 
able to finish it. I thought maybe it was just me, so I asked my 
girlfriend, another IF veteran, to play the game, but she got stuck at the 
same place that I did. I wrote to the author and found out that we had both 
essentially done everything we were supposed to do, but were stuck because 
of a serious bug that often turns the final puzzle into a roadblock.

The other major flaw is shallow implementation, whereby a lot of scenery 
items can't be examined, and lots of other details are overlooked. Of 
course, this is what you'd expect in a game written in 24 hours.

Do I recommend Dastardly? Well, I guess that depends on whether you're 
willing to write to the author for help, because I'd expect most people to 
get tripped up by the game's major bug. But if you are so inclined, then 
yes, play it. It's a short, enjoyable little game, with decent characters 
and an interesting but flawed puzzle.

I'll be able to recommend this game much more strongly when Release 2 comes 
out, or if hints or a walkthrough are released. Even if there is never a 
Release 2 (and there usually hasn't been for 24 Hours of Inform games), 
this game shows promise, and I'd be interested to see whatever Andy Chase 
does next.

P.S. Now that I've written to Andy Chase for help on finishing his game, he 
told me that his interest in Inform is somewhat rekindled now. He says that 
a new version of Dastardly may indeed be on the way, though he can't say 
when. To check for any updates, or to get the most recent version of the 
game, visit: http://achase.net/files/32/dastardly

VERSION: Release 0

Dawn of the Demon is a text adventure set in the world of Infocom's Zork about
a thousand years before the founding of the Great Underground Empire and the
use of G.U.E. dating. It is also a prequel for a graphical game, Zork: The
Hidden Evil, which is being produced by The Zork Library
(<a href="http://www.thezorklibrary.com">http://www.thezorklibrary.com</a>). In Dawn of the Demon, you play a nameless
adventurer in search of the Demon's treasure which is rumoured to be hidden
somewhere in the forest south of the One River.

Geographically, the game is fairly large with over 130 locations, including the
cities of Pheebor and Borphee, a large forest, a maze, and a sizeable network
of grue-infested tunnels. I was a bit disappointed with the cities which were
portrayed blandly and with few Zorkian characteristics. Pheebor, for example,
does not yet sport the aqueducts or marble spires mentioned in the Encyclopedia
Frobozzica, but instead offers an understated royal palace with guards, an 
"acedemic-looking" library with yet another librarian sporting glasses and a
hairbun, and a coffee shop which somehow isn't called Starbloits or Pheebucks.
The great Arch is being built in the plaza, however, which does help connect
this Pheebor to the ruins seen in <a href="b.html#bzork">Beyond Zork</a>.

Minor touches like this aside, I can't help but feel that several game
locations were unused for either story or puzzle purposes. The forest, for
example, does its best to have enough landmarks to distinguish one part from
another, but there's still very little in there for the player to interact with.
Likewise, Borphee has to have a harbour and marina because it's famous for it,
but it's just filler here and plays no part in your story.

For your Zork nostalgia dollar, the game both hits and misses, not unlike Star
Trek: Enterprise. The hungus, easily my favourite NPC in the game, scores a
bullseye by deftly combining humour, plot exposition, and a puzzle into one
neat package. Instead of zorkmids, which won't be minted until about 1600 years
later, we have zoons, another borrowing from Beyond Zork. There is some clever
business with the grues involving how they perceive the world, but I was less
happy with the portrayal of grues as a people with a primitive culture, as if
they were Morlocks. A more obvious miss is an accidental mention of the
Flathead mountains long before there were any Flatheads; the coffee shop and a
CD-like disk are anachronistic. Some of the events in Hades might contradict
what we think we know about Yoruk, who won't show up for centuries.

It gets tiresome to point out unpolished prose and spelling errors, but darn it,
they're in there. The game also inspired me to invent two new terms to describe
particular style errors -- the "pointless porch" and the "duh-scription" --
both of which are exhibited in the following example:

    Outside the Pheebor Public Library
    You are standing outside the Pheebor Public Library.

A "pointless porch" is a unnecessary location between a street and a building.
And could there be a better example of a "duh-scription" than the description
of the hilt below?:

   >x sword
    The broadsword has a shiney blade and a jewel-encrusted hilt.

   >x hilt
    The jewel encrusted hilt is encrusted with jewels.

Even with these weaknesses, I still liked the game for its attempt to add to
the Zork ouevre. I appreciated the in-game help menus which helped me through
the game's major bottleneck. If you dislike mapping, there is a pdf file of
maps available. Also, the game will detect if you're having trouble talking
with an NPC and suggest topics to ask him or her about.

VERSION: Release 1

The IF competition, if nothing else, seems to foster amusing experiments
in point of view: 1996 and 1997 gave us <a href = "r.html#ralph">Ralph</a> and <a href = "b.html#bear">A Bear's Night Out</a>,
viewed from the perspective of a dog and a teddy bear, respectively, and
1999's A Day for Soft Food continues the trend by giving the player the
persona of a cat, a common housecat. As with the other two, there's lots
of fun to be had in inhabiting the role, and the author has done much to
exploit the humor of the situation, and while A Day for Soft Food
doesn't have as strong a sense of the limitations of the character, it
works well nonetheless.

As with the other two, the game begins with a task at hand that's
typical of the character's goals; the dog PC was intent on finding a
bone, the teddy bear PC wanted to assemble the materials for a picnic,
and the cat PC, well, just wants to eat, preferably the canned soft food
of the title. Unlike the other two, though, your goals change along the
way, on a few levels: you start solving problems as they present
themselves, whether or not the problems have a clear connection to the
ultimate goal--and you continue solving puzzles even after the original
goal has been attained. While the shift makes sense on some level--the
goal becomes obvious reasonably quickly--it also makes this a rather
different PC from that of, say, Ralph. Part of the humor in Ralph arose
from the PC's total fixation on finding the lost bone, to the exclusion
of everything else; Day for Soft Food picks up on that in some measure
(your Provider becomes steadily more annoyed with your antics over the
course of the game), but moves away from it toward the end, and the
result is a rather anthropomorphic cat. That's not bad, as such, but it
does take some adjustment.

Part of the reason for this is that the puzzles are a bit of a mixed
bag; some of them suggest rather catlike reasoning (particularly in the
way you pester your Provider into waking up and feeding you), and some
really don't--you're not finding a solution to an immediate problem so
much as you're solving task A to get object B to solve puzzle C with.
That aside--again, your cat nature only drives the action to a certain
extent--the puzzles also have some fairness problems; a few are
misleading, or unhelpful at best, in conveying the scale of some
relevant objects (i.e., in relation to you), another is
guess-the-syntax, and another requires that the player know something
that the PC clearly doesn't. The result is that the PC is considerably
less catlike than the PCs in Ralph and Bear's Night Out are doglike and
bearlike--the character isn't as fully realized, and the player can too
easily forget that the PC has limitations that don't afflict human PCs.
(The basic problem, however--that your Provider isn't as good a Provider
as he was previously because of an illness, forcing you to take matters
into your own paws--fits with the cat personality; events are
significant only insofar as they affect your supply of food.)

Despite these problems, though, there's lots of fun to be had here, and
even though the puzzles shortchange the catty aspect of the game
somewhat, the incidental details and fun stuff make up for it. There are
various creative deaths to die, for one thing, and the variety and
number of untimely ends you can suffer (the game occasionally warns you
when an action would end the game prematurely, but usually doesn't
prevent you from doing anything dumb) suggests the perverse curiosity of
a real cat. (Particularly notable in this respect are the deaths when
you jump onto the stump where your Provider is chopping wood, and when
you set a trap then trigger it yourself.) Other amusing bits include
this description of a chair: "The lumpy mountain is home to some of your
finest claw and scratch marks, though your Provider has never shared
much enthusiasm for the art." At its best moments, the game allows the
player to recognize the significance of, say, the Provider's illness,
even while the PC remains oblivious; the serene cluelessness of a cat is
the main source of humor here. Even the writing is subtly catlike, as in
the following description:

   Snowy Maw
   To the east, icicles hang like fangs within a giant maw of snow. A
   large pair of matching tracks lead out of shadows of the snowy mouth
   and to the west. A path loops north and south. 

A cat describes with terms that a cat knows, and therefore icicles are
"fangs," the opening is a "maw," and a car's path down the driveway is a
"pair of matching tracks." Subtle touches like this help the overall
feel of the game considerably.

A Day for Soft Food, like Ralph and, to a lesser extent, A Bear's Night
Out, is worth playing simply to see the fun things that the author does
with the premise. The puzzles have problems, but the overall charm of
the game more than makes up for those deficiencies, enough that I gave
it an 8 in this year's competition.

It's pretty tough to write a horror game effectively. More than any
other emotion, it is hard to strike true fear into a person sitting at a
computer comfortably playing a game. One has to really put the player IN
the game, make them develop an affinity for the characters involved, and
get them out of the mindset of a typical gamer (piddling around with
every little option, restoring saved games at their leisure, etc.) Dead
Reckoning comes close to doing just this, but not close enough.

The game is set in the town of Morrow and leaves you, Duffy, to unravel
the horrors that have come to roost there. You slowly uncover the reason
why all the town's inhabitants are missing or dead while trying to
rescue your friend Edwin from some unknown danger. The author describes
this game as "more of a story-driven game than a puzzlefest," but I
would categorize it somewhere in-between.

As far as putting the player in the game, I believe Dead Reckoning
succeeds, albeit marginally. A thorough implementation of all the
objects mentioned in the game's text contributes heavily to the
immersion factor. I found I could listen to and smell various things,
even examine things that were mentioned as not being there (described,
of course, as absent). Very nice. The evocative descriptions were well
done too, for the most part. A nice example is:

   "Well, well, one of the living," says the corpse, its voice a choking
   rasp. As it speaks, bits of rotten skin flake off from the side of
   its face and drift in lazy spirals down to the dusty floor. "We don't
   get many living ones here anymore, do we, my brethren?"

Sometimes, however, I got the feeling that the author was trying a
little too hard, as in the following exchange between the player and an
NPC:

   "I was the priest here in Morrow until... the bad things happened."
   "The bad things?"
   "Lots of bad things. An ancient evil returned to haunt us, to exact
      revenge for what we did." He shakes his head sadly.

Quite a few things are described as "eerie" or "unsettling," when these
kinds of feelings should be evoked from the player, not spelled out for
them. I never really felt unsettled or afraid while playing because of
my lack of affinity for the characters. I never cared about Duffy or
Edwin at all during the game. Why? Because I didn't know them as
characters, as "real live" people. Dead Reckoning tries a bit in this
regard, unfolding bits and pieces of Duffy and Edwin's past as children
in the course of play, but it left me wanting more. If I'm running for
my life from some zombies, I want a reason why I should even care. On
the other hand, some of the characterizations were done very well; I
just wanted a little more meat to them, I suppose.

As for getting the player out of the mindset of a gamer, the game
succeeds. While the plot is a little linear and progress is sometimes
blocked by puzzles, the puzzles aren't too hard (or numerous), and
multiple endings/deaths are available. When a potential death is near,
the game gives you fair warning about it. While some players may be put
off by messages like, "You have a bad feeling about doing that," I
appreciated the effort from the author to steer me towards the right
path. Once a player dies and has to restart or restore, there's a huge
break in mimesis. The previous message, while still breaking mimesis,
only does so a little, and not nearly as much as restoring your game. In
a horror game where the player's situation is deadly, this is even more
important. I suppose one could argue that the player should never be in
danger of dying in the first place, but that's another topic of
discussion...

Some other nitpicks I had with the game were a fair amount of typos and
some small incongruencies/bugs, but they weren't that noticeable. The
typos were, though.

Overall, I would compare Dead Reckoning to one of the old EC horror
comics; there are some real detailed, spooky descriptions and a nice
zombified plot, but it leaves you painfully aware that you're "just
reading a comic." However, this isn't really bad at all; I love EC
horror comics, and I love horrific art in general, even if it doesn't
scare me. Ergo, I liked this game. If it's not a truly chilling,
engrossing piece of IF, it is a very solid, entertaining romp through a
wonderfully realized, classic horror setting.

Final score - 6 of 10

From: Volker Lanz &lt;volker.lanz SP@G gmx.net&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag20.html">SPAG #20</a> -- March 15, 2000

NAME: Deadline
AUTHOR: Marc Blank (Infocom)
EMAIL: mblank SP@G eidetic.com
DATE: 1983
PARSER: Early Infocom
SUPPORTS: Infocom Ports
AVAILABILITY: Masterpieces
URL: Not available
VERSION: Release 27.

Deadline was the first Infocom mystery and their third released game
(after <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork I</a> and <a href = "z.html#zork2">Zork II</a>). Author Marc Blank said that he did not want
to do another fantasy game after the Zorks and thought that a mystery
was an obvious choice: "I thought it was a great idea because most
people, when they read mysteries, are constantly trying to think ahead,
what happened. 'Ooh, I would have looked here, I would have done this. I
would have been more clever.' So, it seemed to lend itself perfectly."

Deadline was also the first Infocom game to come with feelies: In the
box were interviews with the suspects, some tablets, a photograph of the
murder scene, a letter from the attorney and a coroner's note.

The story: Marshall Robner, a wealthy industrialist, is found dead in
his locked-up library one morning. He died of an overdose of Ebullion, a
medicine he has been taking for his depressions. An apparent suicide...
Really? The attorney of the deceased asks you, the detective, to
investigate this case to "quash the suspicions" that are inevitable when
a wealthy man dies an unnatural death. You have twelve hours to solve
this case and you begin your work on a Friday morning at 8 a.m.

From the beginning, almost the complete playing field is accessible to
the player, so Deadline is a good choice for everyone who likes wide
game designs and non-linear plots. On the other hand, Deadline also
suffers from the "you-have-to-know-what's-happening-where-and-when"
problem that <a href = "s.html#suspect">Suspect</a> later showed (though not as much): By your actions,
you are likely to trigger reactions of the NPCs that happen somewhere
else. If you don't know that, you are likely to miss crucial points of
the plot.

Speaking of NPCs: This is where the game really shines. The six main
NPCs (not counting the attorney, who only plays a minor role) are really
fleshed out; they act reasonable and consistent to their character and
motives. You can show a lot of things to them and study their reactions,
you can ask them about many topics, you can follow them around, you can
accuse them and listen to what they have to say. Only few i-f games have
such complete NPCs, I would say.

A weaker point of the game is the early parser it uses: It understands a
lot of things, but sometimes gets confused or reacts in the wrong way to
the player's input. Also, the game is quite buggy if you do things that
the author apparently didn't think of (the Infocom Bug List on GMD only
shows about a third of the bugs I found).

One major problem with the game is how hard it is: Not only do you have
to get evidence against the guilty party, you also have to prove that a
crime was committed at all. This turns out to be a tough job and can
cause the player quite a headache for some time. Some actions you have
to perform aren't that obvious (what to do with the holes in the garden;
or how long exactly you have to wait before you may interrupt certain
NPCs when they are doing something -- too early and you can't prove
what they did, too late and they've finished), so players may be tempted
to revert to a walkthrough or the hints.

All in all, Deadline is a good game that is still worth playing after
all these years -- in my opinion the best mystery that Infocom did.

VERSION: Release 3

A short, two-location game, Deadsville is a fun twist on a George Romero 
premise.  Despite a limited palette of one NPC, two locations and a small number 
of objects it&#8217;s rich and well written, proving that an enjoyable game does not 
need complexity.   

Defeating the NPC and winning the game is fairly straightforward.  It can be 
done in less than twenty moves and took me about 15 minutes the first time.  
However, that&#8217;s not really the point.  After the first play I spent over an hour 
repeatedly replaying the game to find all iterations.  A well-implemented hints 
menu contains a number of amusing suggestions including a command that allows 
the player to explore all of the losing options without having to restart each 
time.  Even the &#8220;default&#8221; responses are entertaining and well thought out and 
there were several times I laughed out loud when I got a response that I wasn&#8217;t 
expecting.

As for technical details, the game is bug free and well implemented, with no 
&#8220;guess the verb&#8221; problems.  No &#8220;guess the noun&#8221; problems, either - the game 
accepts a surprisingly large list of nouns to refer to the NPC and objects.  I 
only found one flaw - after defeating the NPC character, re-examining an object 
gives the pre-defeat response &#8211; and my only objection is that a single sentence 
within the response refers obliquely to the NPC as though still undefeated and 
in no way affects the playability.   I can only wish that all IF games were this 
thoroughly debugged.

Deadsville is &#8220;horror&#8221; in much the same way the movie &#8220;Shaun of the Dead&#8221; is 
horror &#8211; no lurid descriptions of gore to off-put the weak of stomach.  You 
don&#8217;t have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate Deadsville, but if you&#8217;re the 
sort of person who laughs when the ditzy teenager gets her gruesome comeuppance 
you&#8217;ll find it especially entertaining. 

I look forward to the full game.  The atmosphere is dead on and the characters 
are as fleshed out as they can be (every possible pun intended).  Some tougher 
puzzles might be enjoyable.  In any case, if the author takes as much time and 
trouble with the full version as with the intro, Deadsville could well become a 
classic.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Deadsville a 3 for difficulty and 8 overall.

AUTHOR: E. L. (Ev) Cheney
EMAIL: ?
DATE: c. 1986
PARSER: GAGS standard
SUPPORTS: All GAGS and AGT Ports

People who don't like the AGT parser should be made to play a few GAGS
games some time.  AGT looks like Virtual Reality by comparision.

GAGS was the predecessor to AGT, and AGT is backwardly compatible
enough to be able to use most GAGS source code.  The big difference
between the two is that GAGS does not allow any of the meta-commands
that AGT does.  As a result the parser is almost completely limited to
Open/Close, Push/Pull, Turn, Touch, and a couple of others.  All
puzzles must be solved with these, and are pretty much restricted to
killing monsters and opening locks.

Deena of Kolini, by E.L. (Ev) Cheney looks like it wants to be more
detailed, but it is held in bondage to the limitations of the GAGS
system (considering the content of the game, this may be poetic
justice).

In the game, you play Deena, a warrior-maiden POW captured when your
people were attacked by the lecherous Gendi.  Tossed in a dark, damp,
dank dungeon, your mission is to escape both your cell, and what was
called &quot;a fate worse than death&quot; in <a href = "p.html#plunder">Plundered Hearts</a>.  Along the way
you must find and rescue a handsome but wounded Prince, not for
romantic reasons, but because you need him to illuminate rooms that
your torch cannot (don't ask me about this, I haven't got a clue
either).  Actually, according to the source code, the Prince is not
only luminous but edible (!), which made me very thankful that GAGS
doesn't permit any customized descriptions for this.

It appears as though the author tried hard to flesh out the game as
much as possible within the system.  In the early days of GAGS and
AGT, many authors did not bother to write item descriptions for many
things, resulting in repetitious &quot;You see nothing special about the
&lt;item&gt;&quot; messages whenever you tried to examine something (Even <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork 1</a>
was guilty in this area).  In this game, Ms. Cheney not only provided
item descriptions for everything, but also accompanying graphics.  The
whip, the manacles, the red-hot poker, (no, I am NOT making this up)
are all rendered in fairly good quality ASCII line drawings.  My
favourite one was the scrap of parchment, which should show you how
boring I am.  The author did not just throw this game together, she
obviously worked hard.  However, the technology of the day just wasn't
enough to give more than a rudimentary result.

One avoidable problem is in the game's spelling and grammar.  The
spelling errors can be very distracting at times, and there are
several places where sentences have single words gouged out of the
middle (i.e.: &quot;The rawhide whip looks as if it could the skin off a
dragon&quot; [sic]).

My biggest design complaint about the game is the decision to conclude
the game with an escape through a maze.  Actually there are two mazes
side by side.  One goes nowhere, but the author was kind enough to
include an item that will at least point you towards the right one.

I've always regarded mazes as being the I-F equivalent of
rock-climbing. If that phrase sounds familiar, you've probably played
Chris Forman's excellent <a href = "#detectmst">Mystery Science Theater game</a> where he makes
the same comment about <a href = "#detect">Detective</a>'s seemingly endless hallways.

The reference is to the 1951 movie &quot;Lost Continent&quot;, starring Cesar
Romero and Hugh &quot;Ward Cleaver&quot; Beaumont.  This was an early MST3K
episode which featured a 12 minute sequence in the middle that showed
nothing but the main characters rapelling up a rockface (not even on
location).  Basically, &quot;rock-climbing&quot; means &quot;padding&quot; (although in
this game &quot;padding&quot; may also be poetic justice).

[SIDE NOTE: For those who were wondering about the &quot;Deep Hurting!!&quot;
reference immediately after the rock-climbing one in Chris's game,
this is a reference to another MST3K movie (Hercules Against the Moon
Men) that was supposed to top &quot;rock-climbing&quot; with a 15 minute
Sandstorm scene, that was gloatingly guaranteed to cause &quot;Deep
Hurting!&quot;.]

The maze was a legitimate puzzle (even a clever one) when it first
appeared in <a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a> because no one had ever seen it before.
Since then it has been primarily used like &quot;rock-climbing&quot;; to
artificially pad the length of a game that would otherwise be a little
short.  There is no longer any puzzle; since everybody knows HOW to
get through them.  All that is left is the tedium of actually doing
it.

There are a few games which really add something new to the idea (For
example, <a href = "a.html#arthur">Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur</a>'s Badger Maze presents us
with a genuinely new puzzle; how do you map a maze when you can't drop
objects behind you?), but these are the exception rather than the
rule.

Nothing against the maze in general.  I loved the Babel Fish puzzle in
<a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's Guide</a>, but I wouldn't want half the games in circulation
to have the same identical puzzle in them.  (It could be worse though.
Suppose everybody tried to imitate the Baseball Diamond maze in <a href = "z.html#zork2">Zork
2</a>!?  Yuck!)

Not to single Ms. Cheney out for criticism, but it's so annoying to
pick up an ostensibly new game only to find the same old boring
time-consuming puzzle poke its head up time after time after time.
You know the old much-lampooned bumper sticker that said &quot;I Brake for
Animals&quot;?  I'm going to get one that says &quot;I Scream for Mazes.&quot;

Well [climbing off the soapbox], back to the game at hand.  It also
features some of the more common (but avoidable) quirks of the
GAGS/AGT system, such as having to use one specific weapon to kill
each creature, but not others.  For example, the dagger will kill one
(non-magical) person, but the sword will not.  Where's the sense in
that?

One non-avoidable problem is that in GAGS/AGT, creatures must be
classified as either friendly or hostile, and all hostile ones will
block your path and try to kill you.  As a result, the lecherous old
man who fondles you in the stairwell but does not attack you, must be
classified as friendly, and therefore if you attack him, you get the
standard message that asks why you would want to attack such a
harmless and inoffensive creature, and that it looks hurt and
betrayed.

There are a few rooms of Instant-Fate-Worse-Than-Death, but there are
sufficient clues for them to be avoided.

Ms. Cheney obviously put a lot of effort into her game, but the
technology of 10 years ago just wasn't up to the task, even with the
recent desire for games with female lead characters.  She could have
improved the final result with a little more proofreading and
playtesting, but even so GAGS just doesn't have the proper...verbs for
her little excursion into S&M to fly.

  NAME: Deep Space Drifter             PARSER: TADS standard

  AVAILABILITY: IF Archive, shareware ($15)   WRITING: Fair

     You are a space explorer who is almost out of fuel. With the last 
reserves you manage to reach a space station. However, the station seems 
to be under attack and nobody is around. What is going on only gradually 
becomes clear. To get really rescued you must go down to the planet 
below and find an escape vessel.
     The part of the game on the space station is good, with quite a bit 
of atmospheric details and generally good puzzles. But down at the 
planet things are less convincing. Everything is deserted, but no real 
reason for this is given. Several of the puzzles here are also very 
time-consuming and tedious. Among these puzzles are the game's two 
infamous mazes. The mazes are novel (no &quot;twisty passages, all alike&quot;), 
but too large and take a _long_ time to solve.
     The story contains two characters apart from the player, but they 
are not actually part of the _game_. This is to mean that they are 
mentioned in the text, but the player never gets a chance to interact 
with them. Thus the characters are not really NPCs but part of the 
story.
     The game is shareware. Upon registration one gets a very good hint
book with many hints for each puzzle. The hint book is arranged so that
you won't read hints by mistake.

VERSION: Release 1

Joshua Wise's Deephome is a rather uneven effort: it's a well-built
world with plenty of attention to detail, and the setting is nicely
done. As a game, however, it doesn't work so well--there are far too
many mimesis-breaking moments and unfair puzzles--and the result, sadly,
is rather unsatisfying.

The objective, as conveniently laid out in a handy letter, is relatively
simple--reopen and bring back to life the lost city of Deephome, which
involves practical things like restoring the power and water as well as
getting rid of some spirits that seem to be hanging around. Herein lies
the first problem, however: you're told that these spirits are terribly
dangerous, but they stand where they are for the entirety of the game
and don't act threatening in any way--or, even, impede you from doing
anything. They seem about as dangerous as paperweights, and it's hard to
get all worked up about getting rid of them. There's an obvious purpose
to restoring the power and water--accomplishing those tasks serves your
purpose in the game, in fact, apart from giving you points--but not the
spirit-banishing stuff. Moreover, in that you get a vital part of the
formula for getting rid of them from the spirits themselves, these don't
seem like particularly savvy spirits.

The puzzles range from humdrum to rather irritating. Notable is the
adversary you're told is allergic to "certain plants." The one plant
that's prominent in the game isn't effective, however (and the syntax
problems make it far from immediately clear that you need a different
plant rather than different syntax), and the right one is buried in
scenery. It has a lot of company in that respect, in fact--plenty of
vital objects are buried in room descriptions with no hint that they're
takeable. Other problematic puzzles include a bizarre combat sequence in
which the first several attacks elicit both a "cries out in pain"
message and a "your enemy notices you" message. There's also a puzzle
that turns on a property of your body that you don't know about, and has
almost no motivation other than the fact that certain suggestive objects
are in close proximity. Another is made more difficult than it needs to
be by confusion between "on" and "in," and another requires that you go
through a series of steps with no way of fathoming the final result
(i.e., the motivation). The best puzzles are the most straightforward,
the ones that rely entirely on common-sense judgments--the ones that try
to be cleverer than that end up being painfully nonintuitive. (One
strange touch is that you get a point for visiting every location, so
you can finish with less than the optimal number of points merely
because you don't get around to visiting all the nonessential rooms.)

As suggested, part of the reason the puzzles don't work particularly
well is that there are plenty of technical problems, enough that it
usually isn't clear whether a given attempt at solving a puzzle is wrong
or simply not worded properly. Among the problems are objects mentioned
in both the room description and in a separate line, objects so
inadequately described that some of their salient features need to be
inferred, and objects that can be examined but not taken before a search
of another object turns them up. The writing likewise doesn't do the
game many favors: there are lots of misspellings and misused words, and
while certain moments are described well, others are rather underdone.
The following exemplifies the unevenness of the writing:

   The main hall is quite large, and is lit by magical torches that line
   the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose
   room. Elevators hang in mid air, no longer powered. To the northeast
   is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that
   has long since been removed, to the northwest is a staircase leading
   up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you
   see the railway station. A main street runs to the south. 

"Grandiose" room? How does this character know that the opening was
usually covered by a tapestry that has long since removed, or that his
people lived in one of the villages? On the other hand, though, there
are well-done bits in this description--"elevators hang in mid-air, no
longer powered" is vivid and concisely described, and the "pattern" of
torches that "spirals up" the room is nicely conveyed. The writing is
mostly good enough to set the scene, in other words, but shot through
with enough mistakes to make the reading less than fully pleasurable.

The above problems are particularly frustrating because the story is
actually pretty good. For one thing, the plot is refreshingly
small-scale for fantasy--you're not saving the world or acquiring vast
stores of wealth, you're simply exploring one city and performing
certain tasks. That, in itself, suggests restraint, and it helps the
story feel more immediate and less implausible than it might be.
Moreover, much more detail than was strictly necessary went into the
game--there's an encyclopedia lying around that has information on all
sorts of topics, for instance, and there are certain elements of the
game that get developed seemingly just to round out the story, in
particular your religion. There are even some red herrings that point
toward a sequel, and while that's not usually a great design choice
(insofar as it encourages the player to spend time on apparent puzzles
that can't be solved) it does convey the sense that there's more to the
setting than the bare bones required for the puzzles. Likewise, there
are quite a few locations that are there only to make the city feel more
complete--and while some of them feel a little gratuitous, most are well
chosen. The main fly in the ointment is a maze that isn't especially
creative or well-rendered--the game would be better if the maze had been
left out--but on the whole the setting is competently done and serves
the purposes of the story. 

Deephome, in short, is a mixed bag. Enough thought clearly went into its
crafting that the setting feels real, and the story is well thought out.
The game aspect, unfortunately, has serious problems, significant enough
that getting through the puzzles can be a major hassle. If some of the
writing and technical problems get resolved, a sequel or a revised
release of Deephome would be worth checking out.

VERSION: Release 0.50

One of the nice things about fantasy IF--particularly the sort of
fantasy IF that Graham Nelson has called "lazy medieval," which covers
anything prior to the invention of gunpowder--is that the ground is so
heavily trodden that it's easy'n'fun to stand the player's expectations
on their head. Leonard Richardson's Degeneracy does just that, and while
the trick itself isn't an unqualified success, it works well enough.

It seems you've been enlisted to kill a certain Baron--not only have you
been enlisted, in fact, you've gone and done it just before the game
starts, and your mission is now to get out of the Baron's castle.
Problem is, the Baron has cursed you, and the curse prevents you from
escaping, so you need to delve into some alchemy books to undo the
curse. There's also a time limit of sorts, it turns out, though it's
generous enough that you don't need to be extremely efficient. The game
itself isn't particularly long--it can easily be solved in under 100
moves, and the time limit kicks in at about 200 moves or so.

The puzzles aren't especially exciting--there are only a few of them,
and reading the manuals you find is essentially all you need to do--but
there's lots of fun to be had in the writing. Much of it is
mock-Elizabethan or thereabouts--lots of Surprising Capitalizations, for
one thing, often put to amusing purposes. (There's one object containing
water that you can pour over your head; suitably instructed, the game
tells you that "you fit your Head under the deluge from the [object],
and moisten your Hair." Better still are the antics of a pig you
encounter, such as:

   The Pig wanders over to the heavy Portcullis & pokes its snout
   through on of the gaps in the iron Gate. A wistful look comes across
   the Pig's face, as it ponders a more carefree time in its life, a
   time redolent with Rolls in cool Mud & games of <<Got Your Snout>>
   with its thirty-seven Grand-Children.

The hints, liberally sprinkled with fake hints in the style of Infocom's
Invisiclues, add to the humor. (E.g., in response to a question about
how to get out of a certain room: "You might follow the carpet." "It
leads off 'toward the sunrise'." "From which direction does the sun
rise?" "Go east." "This is not technically a puzzle.") It's true that
the game doesn't take every opportunity for humor that comes along--at
least, so it seemed to me--but there are some surprisingly funny bits.
(All the funnier because the game appears to take the dour persona of
the PC so seriously.) The author wrote <a href = "g.html#guess">Guess the Verb!</a>, from the 2000
competition, which was similarly full of sly humor.

As mentioned, there's a trick of sorts in the game, on which I won't
elaborate here. It's not a total success; some players, I know, thought
it was a bug, which it most certainly isn't. There are indications that
something's afoot well before the trick happens, though they depend to
some extent, I think, on whether the player's moving around--fewer, if
any, of the clues would be apparent to a player who's staying in one
room working on a puzzle. (Technically, none of the puzzles are so hard
that such concentration should be warranted, but you never know.) The
nature of the trick is such that, unless duly warned, the player's
likely to attribute the effect to a bug--that the author isn't extremely
well known works against him in this case. (If it were Zarf trying to do
the same thing, in other words, the player might tend to have more
faith.) The moral is that an author planning a surprise of this kind
should err on the side of overcluing (and taking excessive precautions
to ensure that the player will see the clues). That aside--and I did get
the clues, so it did work for me--it's a pretty clever idea, and again,
the medieval setting helps: the player expects breaches of the fourth
wall less, perhaps, than he or she might otherwise.

It's also worth noting that, for a short game that may well exist for
purposes of the above trick, Degeneracy's world is quite thoroughly
created. There's a religion that, if not exhaustively described, comes
across enough to be understood. There's a political system (well, hints
about one). There' s a reasonably complex system of alchemy. And aside
from all this, there are a couple of magic systems that have a variety
of effects and are reasonably consistently applied. The production
values are good enough, then, that this isn't simply lazy medieval
fantasy.

Degeneracy isn't a masterpiece, but it's not strictly a one-trick pony
either--there's plenty to appreciate aside from the central gimmick.

VERSION: Release 4

Delightful Wallpaper divides neatly into two main puzzles. Since these are very
different from each other and almost unrelated, I'm going to discuss them 
separately.

THE LOGIC MAZE

The first puzzle is a kind of maze, although more like Robert Abbott's "logic 
mazes" than the twisty little variety that everyone seems to hate. You start 
exploring a small mansion, but you lack the ability to do anything but walk 
around. As you move around, though, the mansion reacts in predictable ways. For 
example, walking through one doorway may open a door elsewhere, entering a room 
might change the direction of a one way door- that sort of thing.

To put it briefly, I loved this puzzle. The mansion opens up a little bit at a 
time as you play. Manipulating the mansion properly will allow you to reach a 
new area, which you can use to manipulate another bit of the mansion, which will 
allow you to reach another new area... and it keeps going on like that until 
you've explored the entire place. You always have either a new room to visit or 
a new thing to play with. This pacing kept me interested and engaged through the 
entire puzzle.

There are a few places where I might have become bored trying to figure out 
exactly what had happened after I'd triggered some change in the mansion. But 
this problem was avoided by my notebook, where "I" kept notes of all the things 
that affected the mansion and, once I happened upon them, what the effects were. 
And even if *I* didn't notice a change, the *PC* would notice and jot it down, 
so when I checked the notebook I'd see what was going on. This kept me from ever 
getting stuck for long, and so I never did get bored or frustrated with the game 
during this puzzle.

In case I haven't made myself clear: this was my favorite puzzle of the entire 
competition.

THE "INTENTIONS" PUZZLE

Partway through the maze part of the game, I made the note: "If this keeps up, 
I'll love the game."

Sadly, "this" didn't keep up.

The second puzzle is a good idea, but it just didn't work like the first one 
did. For this part of the game, the mansion has been populated with characters 
for a murder mystery. As you move about, you see notes like "Mr. P__ will pass 
through the room, carrying a tray of drinks." You will also collect "intentions" 
and use them in various places, modifying what the characters will do. The idea 
is that adding intentions in various ways will change the things that will go on 
in the other rooms, allowing you to further manipulate the characters.

I like the idea. It could be really interesting trying to arrange intentions in 
the proper order to make things come out "right," like the puzzle in "Lock and 
Key". There are two problems, though. First, there is a single right use for 
each intent, and you can tell from your notes whether you've got it right or 
not. Thus, there's no need to think carefully about how the intents will affect 
each other, because you can deal with them one at a time.

The second problem is that it's not at all clear how exactly the intents will 
work until you get it right. So my procedure for solving the puzzle was to find 
an intent, make a guess as to where it might be used, go there and try using it 
randomly until something fit, and repeat. This did not make for a satisfying 
puzzle.

[EDIT: It turns out that I was mistaken about there being a single right use for
each intent. The author informs me that there are multiple uses for many of the
intents that can lead to a winning solution. I just didn't run into them, or else
didn't realize that they weren't dead ends. So if you take the time to experiment
instead of playing from the notes, this is probably a much more interesting
puzzle. -DJ]

MISCELANEOUS AND CONCLUSION

A few other miscellaneous things: There are quite a few unimplemented things 
that should be, such as the walls. Given the game's title, I really should be 
able to look at them. The setup and story never really get explained; I still 
don't know what's going on. And the second part of the game contained some 
innuendo, which detracted from the game for me and could have been done without, 
and a lot of murders, which I didn't mind but you may want to be aware of,
particularly if kids might be playing the game. (I treated the innuendo like I 
do bad language, and docked a point from my comp rating for the game.) Finally, 
it would have made things easier for me if I could have just typed "notes" to 
look at my notepad.

My recommendation: Get this game, and just play the first half. (That's until 
you use the first intention.) That half of the game is well designed and well 
worth your time.

CHARACTERS: A tad hackneyed (1.3)   PUZZLES: Clever (1.6)
MISC: A bit too much story, but thought-provoking (1.6)
OVERALL: 7.7

One thing about C.E. Forman's Delusions that can't possibly be denied
is that it's got plot. Boy, has it got plot--several stories' worth,
at least. If your head isn't spinning by the end of it (for that
matter, by the time the first few twists come long), you missed a lot
and you should go back and replay it. Moreover, the plot takes on a
variety of guises along the way--part science experiment, part
techno-thriller, part mystery (well, sort of), part, um,
metaphysical-technological thesis, etc. If there's one thing Delusions
isn't, it's predictable.

It's arguable, of course, whether cramming a game full of story
enhances its enjoyability; at bottom, it's a matter of taste, and
depends in large part on whether the player is interested in the story
at hand. It also depends, of course, on how well integrated into the
game the story is, and in this respect in particular, Delusions
shines: the puzzles serve the purposes of the plot, and the challenges
are hurdles that reflect crucial discoveries or roadblocks in the
story. They are, to be sure, far from easy; I doubt I ever would have
guessed a few of them without the aid of the hint menu--but they are
distinctly not puzzles thrown into an unrelated story. The charm of
this is that puzzle-solving and figuring out the plot are usually one
and the same task, so there isn't a sense of &quot;gee, I've got to figure
out how to do this to move the story along&quot;--usually, at least.

To say much about the story beyond the initial premise would spoil it,
so...you are part of a research team doing VR simulations, and as the
game begins, you are busy trying to debug one of them, a scenario in
which you play a fish dodging hungry predators. The opening few
puzzles within the simulation are an appealing introduction and help
draw the player into the game, though I was hoping that the fish scene
would play more of a role in the game than it does. At any rate, the
plot thickens appropriately once you've done what you need to do as a
fish, in a variety of unexpected ways.

In one key respect, Delusions has an odd split personality: there are
sections of the game where the plot is more or less told to you via
several screens of text, and there are other sections where the game
gives you virtually no guidance and you're left to piece things
together from some fairly obscure clues. Both parts, to be sure, make
some sense within the plot of the game, but the gameplay is a bit
disorienting as a result (not, of course, inconsistently with the tone
of the story). Early discoveries, furthermore, encourage the player to
view what he's told with skepticism, and yet the plot elements you're
told later are essentially true. In some respects, this can't be
avoided--there's too much story here for the player to discover it all
by himself, without resort to diary entries or some other such tired
device, and certain points simply have to come out via screens of
text. But given that one of the most intriguing plot elements comes
out through discovery, there's still a bit of tension there.

That element bears mention because <a href = "b.html#babel">Babel</a>, a 1997 competition entry,
did something similar, though the author has since said that he hadn't
played Delusions and came up with the idea by himself. Though both use
it effectively, Delusions tries something more ambitious that ends up
slowing things down: the required set of actions has a sequence in
mind (with some, but only some, variation allowed), meaning that, once
the player gets the idea, the process boils down to walking around and
manipulating objects rather than discovering as the plot presumably
intended. It would work better if there were more obvious logic to the
sequence, but there wasn't any that I could guess, and the eventual
conclusion was apparent long before the chain was
over. (Whereas--perhaps I'm just dense--I didn't guess the
corresponding revelation in Babel.) The post hoc explanations for why
you don't tumble to this discovery before seem just a little thin,
moreover.

This is nitpicking, though, because the plot does work very well
indeed.  Particularly effective, even though frustrating, is the
middle section of the game, which repeats ad infinitum until you find
a way to break out of the loop. The puzzles associated with this are
difficult but fair: everything is put together logically, and the
tension, when it seems like your plan might get foiled, is real. The
nightmarish aspect of this section of the game derives mostly from the
presence of a certain NPC, and it's to the author's credit that the
NPC, though he provides virtually no interaction--he talks to you, you
can't say much back--is an intimidating presence. His dialogue is
well-written and doesn't feel too heavily borrowed from standard
science fiction, though then again I wouldn't know.  Also very
good--and thoroughly coded; I didn't find much that broke the
spell--is a certain change in your environment that you cause in order
to get through the scene. Arguably, the NPC might have figured out
what you're up to, but it's still a memorable moment. The only real
flaw in the middlegame is a repeated message that you really want to
get out of this--it loses its effectiveness after the first time or
so, I found. The endgame, unfortunately, doesn't quite live up to what
comes before--the dramatic confrontation could come from any thriller,
and the final resolution just didn't feel climactic to me. There are
some clever puzzles--though one depends on finding a hidden object at
a time when you weren't aware that you needed it--and the ending does
tie up most of the plot questions, but, as far as the story goes, the
middle part works best.

Technically, Delusions is impressive. I found very few bugs, most
actions have synonyms, and there are several code tricks involving
subtle changes in the game environment, or in the game's responses,
that work well. The writing is error-free and effective throughout, in
a way that moves the plot along without drawing attention to itself.
A computer is thoroughly done, though it's a bit tedious to use--then
again, seeing as it's running a &quot;Windows 2000&quot; system, perhaps that's
design on the author's part. There are very few obvious
illogicalities, even accepting the game's various plot twists; the
game is well-designed, well-crafted.

At bottom, though, Delusions seems to aspire to be more than simply a
well-crafted collection of puzzles, and that's where the difficulty
comes in. There are Bigger Issues at stake in the puzzles you solve,
and while the game does offer some food for thought, my problem with
it is that those issues don't really affect what you do. Delusions is
in many respects a better game than <a href = "t.html#tapestry">Tapestry</a>, another 1996 competition
entry that dealt with questions metaphysical, but Tapestry did force
the player to weigh the problems and make decisions; here, except for
one moment at the end of the game, you solve puzzles, largely. To be
sure, this is a different sort of game than Tapestry, and it succeeds
on an entirely different level--but in that there certainly are
intriguing questions being raised throughout, and periodically
mentioned in passing by this NPC or that, I wanted them to have more
to do with your actions and decisions.  Put another way, the player
can more or less opt out of the thought-provoking bits of Delusions by
breezing through the text and moving on to the next puzzle.

Theoretical objections aside, Delusions is an outstanding game in
several respects, and if you missed the 1996 competition, this is
without a doubt one of the entries you should check out now. Even if
it gets a few things wrong, it does a whole lot of interesting stuff
right.

&quot;OK boys. Looks like she's finished. Let's roll her out!&quot;

Yes, folks, Delusions is that oft-maligned example of the IF community
- a, for want of a better word (Though, no doubt, I'll be inundated
with mails giving me one), cyberpunk game. And yes, the initial
section of the game doesn't seem awfully original. And yes, the rest
of the game seems to follow much the same pattern. And yes, I am
building up to a completely expected shock-bluff role reversal.
Because, despite this, Delusions is a Good Game.

But first, so that we can build up to an exciting climax, we'll start
with the bad points. Good game though it is, Delusions seems flawed in
many ways. Take the opening. Yes, it may well just be me, but I can't
help laughing every time I read &quot;Reality is so... unreal.&quot;. And it
goes on. I'll happily admit to not being a fan of (What I'd tend to
see as) &quot;waffly&quot; writing, but even so Delusions goes further than
most. This seems surprising, considering that the rest of the writing
seems to be of such a high standard. It's obvious that effort has been
put into making the world of Delusions believable. Everything you'd
expect to find in a cramped laboratory/living quarters is there. But
still. Back to that later.

The worst thing about the writing is that, at times, there is so much
of it. Several times when you confront your (apparent) arch-nemesis,
you're left sitting for several turns unable to do anything except hit
z and wait while the conversation progresses. Pages of it, sometimes.
Somehow, it seems wrong to apparently give you a choice of things to
do (It's split up, so you get a prompt. Except that, whatever you do,
you've got little choice except to carry on reading.), and then watch
as your character says things that you don't expect him to. Again. And
again.

Perhaps this is the main problem. The player character ends up in a
situation which would be impossible to end up in in real life, and as
a result it's next to impossible to empathise. Of course, I felt sorry
for him and angry at the way he'd been treated. But in the third
person, rather than the first. (Does that make any sort of sense at
all?)

But even so. Sometimes, you are given a choice to influence the future
direction of the game, or so it seems. Because, whenever you get to
this sort of situation, it's obvious that the author wants you to make
one particular choice rather than another. Which leads to my major
problem with the game.

Yes, the big hammer o' morality has been dragged out again in order to
demonstrate that, in the end, we should forgive and forget. When your
character agonizes over whether or not to kill his tormentors, you've
got a choice.
A) Kill them, die instantly and lose all your points.
B) Don't kill them, carry on with the game and gain a point.

Now, which one seems like the &quot;Proper&quot; path?

Choices which influence a game's outcome generally make the game more
interesting, since the player feels that they're having more of an
effect. But the ones in Delusions feel more like &quot;instant-death&quot;
puzzles than anything else. The outcome is based on what the author
thinks, rather than what the player does. If anything, it makes the
game feel more restrictive than if you hadn't been offered the choice
in the first place.

So, then. Why did I say that Delusions was good? To some extent, it's
the attention to detail. The TV in one of the rooms shows Jeopardy.
There's a huge mass of documentation to go along with the VR system.
Everything you'd expect to find, you find. The characters all seem to
have clearly defined personalities, backed up by their personal
effects.

And the plot. To begin with, it didn't sound promising. None of the
initial ideas are terribly ground breaking. Come to that, neither are
any of the later ones. But, somehow, there's a fairly engaging plot.
Even if you're not empathising with the main character, you're
interested in finding out what's going on. What motivates the main NPC
becomes clear as the game progresses, and it all holds together
nicely.

So. Overall then. If you're willing to overlook the basic lack of
originality, the tedious (to my mind) morality bits and the fact that
the bad guy talks far too much, it's a well written and competently
programmed game. The &quot;Big revelation&quot; doesn't come as too much of a
surprise if you've been paying attention to what's going on, but
that's a good thing rather than a bad one.

Out of ten? Seven. Not ground breaking, makes you want to hit people
in places, but still enjoyable.

<A NAME="demon"><h2>Demon's Tomb</h2>
From: Bozzie &lt;edharel SP@G remus.rutgers.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag9.html">SPAG #9</a> -- June 11, 1996

NAME: Demon's Tomb                              PARSER: OK.  Nothing fancy.
AUTHOR: Mastertonic                             PLOT: Stop ancient demon.
EMAIL: ???                                      ATMOSHPHERE: Nice.
AVAILABILITY: Commercial(Bargain bins)          WRITING: Very good.
PUZZLES: Average, but logical                   SUPPORTS: PC
CHARACTERS: Very, very good (See below)         DIFFICULTY: Medium

This is an old game, but nonetheless it is a very good one.  It deals with
such important issues as fighting an ancient evil, sacrificing yourself
in order to save the world (don't worry, not a spoiler), and how to keep a
duck from quacking.

The game starts off with you as Professor Edward Lynton, famed archaeologist,
in an important site in England.  Recently, some strange things have
occurred.  Your partner has gone missing.  You have discovered things in the
site which are both more amazing than your wildest dreams, and more
horrifying than your worst nightmares.  You awake in the middle of the night
and smell smoke... 

With no escape outside this recently discovered tomb, you must send a message
to the outside world, before the tomb becomes your own (and it will, no
matter what you do.  That's made very clear throughout the skimpy manual). 
You have only a short amount of time to do what you must do before you are
overcome by smoke.  Despite your actions, after a certain number of moves,
the prologue ends and the game starts.  

You are Richard, the professor's son, in a car lot near the archeological
site.  You are here to talk to your father, but unfortunately, he is in no
condition to talk.  As you learn more about his death, depending on your
earlier efforts, you will find a tale of a centuries old rivalry, of evil
about to be unleashed and that you are the only one to stop it.

The story itself is nice, and immediately reminded me of a Doctor Who story,
Pyramids of Mars (also a text adventure game at <A HREF="https://ifarchive.org/
if-archive/games/pc/mars.zip">/pc/mars.zip</A>.  Somewhat rough
about the edges, but is a fairly good AGT game) .  The story generally comes
in spurts at a time in some wonderful prose.  Notes, letters, documents all
give some great insights at several interesting people who lived in the area.
While most of these aren't necessary for the game, it is well worth your
time to read everything. 

There are few, if any, &quot;real&quot; characters in Demon's Tomb that you can
interact with, and most of those that there are puzzles more than anything. 
However, the descriptions, as I have said above, more than make up for the
lack of interacting agents.  In fact, in some ways, it makes it better.  As
recent debates on r.a.i-f have shown, there is no easy way to make a good NPC
in a text game, and indeed, even if you manage to, there will still be
problems with him/her.  This way, the author manages to show us some
wonderful characterizations without having to code a lot of time-eating code.
This is not to say that the game is simple.  Indeed, the game tries to be
flashy by offering a menu system and some graphics, space which could have
been used more efficiently.  Indeed, I would have liked there to have been a
good developed character.  For example, how about a motorist I could flag
down and warn, and then find him dead later...

The Parser is sub-Infocom, but quite adequate for its purpose.  The puzzles
themselves are fairly simple, but not overly simple, and they are dynamic, so
as not to bore experienced gamers.  But that doesn't deter from the game, it
adds to it.  There are no completely obscure puzzles, and there are a few
interesting ones.  There are certainly no unfair puzzles, and enough of an
area to explore, so that should you get frustrated at one problem, you'll be
able to explore another area.  And if you really need some help, C. E.
Forman has graciously made a <A HREF="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/
solutions/demonstomb.hnt">hint file</A> of the game on ftp.ifarchive.org.

It is because the story doesn't try to serve complex problems, the author is
able to work on the story, and still throw in a new and interesting puzzle or
two. It also manages to allow freedom to explore, although tends to be mostly
linear in terms of solving problems.  While I could hope for better, in terms
of problem solving and a few other areas, over all, I enjoy this game, and
it's certainly up there on my list of favorite games.

NAME: Depravity Bites
AUTHOR: samjones
EMAIL: samanthamisunderstood SP@G hotmail.com
DATE: 2002
PARSER: TADS standard
SUPPORTS: TADS interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/depravityBITES.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/depravityBITES.zip</a>
VERSION: 1.4

My poor knowledge of English has played an evil joke on me. While
searching the IF-archive TADS games directory, I found a file, which was
quite large (so, I expected that it wasn't one of those tiny two-room
games), and released very recently. Thus, I had the bad luck to download
"Depravity Bites". Later, I checked what the word "depravity" meant.

Ahem... I wish I hadn't seen the game.

In short: this game is about perversity. One of the most decent
paragraphs in the game reads:

   Reaching up gingerly you rub circles around both your nipples,
   tweaking them slightly to prepare them for the pegs. Then you take a
   finger full of flesh just over the left nipple and apply the strong
   peg. At first you don't feel anything but then the sting kicks in. A
   sudden flash of discomfort strikes and your first reaction is to
   remove the clip, but that would defeat the object. As the second peg
   snaps its teeth into the plumped flesh of your right nipple you feel
   the full sting of both pegs take effect. Not a dull pain, but a
   constant, high-pitched tingle, making you think to yourself again
   and again, that you should take these off because they hurt. But you
   don't.

The game explores the darkest corners of homosexuality, sadism, and
masochism. If you think that such a mix is just for you, you can try it.
*Shudder*

Technically, the game is also less than impressive: "guess the verb"
problems, bugs, juvenile and very stupid humor, dull room descriptions.
And did I mention tons of dirt pouring from the game's lines? 

How did I find out so much about the game, though I hadn't the nerve to
finish it? Well, I had a look at the source file, which was enclosed
with the game package. It's amazing how low human beings can demean
themselves. I fear that tonight I'll experience horrible sexual
nightmares. Damn you, "samjones".

I don't want to spend any more of your and my time on this crashing
deviancy. Thus, my final word is: if you're not a sadomasochist, don't
even try to download the game. "Depravity Bites" shows very clearly why
such games like "Stiffy Makane: The Undiscovered Country" -- an evil
parody on AIF (Adult IF) games -- are still being written. Compared to
"Depravity Bites", "SM: TUC" is a Christmas story.

Now I'm going to take a shower, and hope that my review won't be taken
as an advertisement for pornography.


From: Jim Cooper &lt;waiting SP@G thebusstop.demon.co.uk&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag29.html">SPAG #29</a> -- June 20, 2002

I read Stas Starkov's review of this game in SPAG 28 and wondered how
much of his obvious dislike for it stemmed from the game's subject
matter. Being quite broad-minded myself, I thought I'd download the game
and see what it was all about. I really shouldn't have bothered.

The game starts off with you waking up a prisoner in a cellar. Your
naked girlfriend is chained up, and your first task is to try to free
her. The game then proceeds through a series of tasks masterminded by
the owner of the house you're in before culminating in a sex scene in
the back of a van.

Unfortunately, the game falls down not only on the content, which goes
out of its way to be offensive rather than erotic, but is filled with
numerous technical flaws, some of which make the some of the puzzles
unnecessarily difficult -- you play "guess the verb" a few times, for
example. Certain other flaws also make the big sex scene at the end
laughable rather than arousing. To give a more specific example, at one
point you are given an object to perform a task with. Later on, the game
assumes you still have the object, whether you have dropped it since or
not. These obvious flaws disrupt the flow of the game, destroying any
sense of atmosphere that might otherwise build up.

The puzzles themselves aren't actually too bad, although they were
fairly easy -- I managed to complete it in about 4 hours without
reference to the provided hint sheet. The game also comes with the
source code, if the hint sheet isn't enough for you. One or two puzzles
are quite difficult, the initial one for instance, which the game itself
gives you hints about.

All in all, this game isn't worth playing even if you are into this kind
of thing. It deliberately sets out to shock rather than excite or
interest and, for me, it failed to even do that. Sorry, samjones, but
you can see far worse than this with just ten minutes on a decent
internet search engine. If you are easily shocked, avoid this game. If
you're not, this game will bore you. Even a dedicated sado-masochist
will find nothing of interest here, unless putting up with all the
errors counts as masochism.

ATMOSPHERE: Technical errors interfere too much (0.3)
GAMEPLAY: Bad parser, plagued by errors         (0.5)
WRITING: Tries quite hard but, well, fails      (0.6)
PLOT: Well, there is one, and it's reasonable   (1.2)
WILDCARD: This really isn't a good game, so I'm
      not going to give it any Wildcard points. (0.0)
TOTAL: Just don't bother.                       (2.6)

*** Initial Thoughts 

A lot of people don't like choose-your-owns, so to them, this will not
appeal. In truth, they don't always appeal to me. In this particular
case, however, I actually thought it worked fairly well. I didn't
explore all the possible choices (although I did double up on a couple
paths) so I don't know how flexible the game ultimately was, but it
looked to have at least some degree of freedom in it.

*** Writing (B+)

Despite some perhaps overly-lengthy prose in spots, the writing in this
was rather well-done. I found many of the descriptions quite enchanting,
bringing to mind a definite feel and genre that itself is quite magical,
and one in which it is easy to get drawn in and lost within when it is
(as it was) done correctly.

Take, for instance, this bit from the opening:

   "The sound of windblown sand smoothing the dunes and scouring the
   city walls is the only song nature produces in Hajima." 

With the very first sentence, mood and setting are already firmly in
place, a setting which is only enhanced (and never contradicted) by
further room and event descriptions. And best yet, although the game
does tell you "this is who you are, this is what you can do", it never
seems to do it in a way that felt limiting (to me), though ultimately,
of course, it was rather narrow in scope.

*** Plot (B)

As with all CYOAs (and how many times have I used that phrase, anyhow?),
there is not a LOT of flexibility in plot, but as is more rare, there is
a rich plot here. It is true that it is quite stereotypical. It is also
true that sometimes that's a good thing. (See also NPCs, below.)

Stereotypical stories are sometimes, instead, more -archetypal-; they
use settings, people, and situations that we all are familiar with, and
merely attempt to display the story in a manner in which will appeal. I
believe that this was the author's intent (although don't know for
sure), and if so, it worked quite well for me. Others, looking for
something new and original, will probably prefer to give this a pass,
although I might add that there is not much in the way of either new or
original left in the world. It is merely the skill with which stories
are displayed that, ultimately, determines how people react to it.

*** Puzzles (D)

As a CYOA adventure, it should perhaps not really be rated on puzzles,
but as there are several critical decision points that can make a large
difference, in this case I elected to do so. And that is where things
fall short.

Could it have been done differently and retained the format? Yes. There
could have been more decision points; they could have been presented in
a way that combined both more internal world knowledge with more
difficult choices. When it came to a point where I had to make a choice,
often I felt as if I were presented with choices that the -character-
would understand the implication of but I would not. That, alas, was the
big flaw in an otherwise enjoyable experience.

*** NPCs (B)

Adam Cadre, whose opinion I quite respect but with whom I frequently
disagree, felt offended by the stereotypes in this game. Others saw his
point. I disagreed, because I felt there was no intent to hold up and
portray negative and shallow characters. I felt they were meant to be
archetypes (see also Plot, above). 

So, be warned: there are no terribly deep characters in the game. You
see only glimpses of their true personality, and even those show
something fairly basic and, yes, cliche. But... it WORKS. This is not
the real world. This is the storyworld, where everyone has a defined
role, and everyone has a part to play. And it is the success in -that-
upon which I rated the NPCs highly.

Realism in NPCs is a prized thing, difficult to obtain, but the clever
and careful use of caricature and archetype can result in some lovely
story building. Desert Heat accomplishes this with flair.

*** Technical (C)

CYOA games are not difficult to produce. I found no bugs.

*** Tilt (C+) and Final Thoughts

This is definitely not a game for everyone. Simply the genre alone would
ensure that; I myself have a love-hate relationship with romances, if
you will pardon the potential pun. The format and style as well are both
potentially off-putting. Still, if you have any interest in a richly
told tale, I would suggest giving the game a chance. It was one of the
more enjoyable -- if not one of the longest lived -- moments of the
comp.

        In this game you play a heroic detective who has to find and
arrest the murderer of the mayor.  Surprisingly, the only commands needed
to solve 'Detective' are north, east, south, and west.  It is possible to
pick up a few items along the way in order to increase the score, but none
of these items has any effect on the story.
        To cut a long story short, the author made every mistake one can
think of; it is not necessary to go into detail.  After all, we should
not forget that Matt wrote this game with good intentions and he offered
it for free, so who are we to mock at his efforts?  Every computer store
sells a lot of expensive CD-ROMs which are no better than &quot;Detective&quot;.

     Detective was previously reviewed in SPAG 4, but I'd like to do it
again, as I have a slightly different take.  This review stems from an
e-mail conversation with Magnus Olsson, in regards to his review of
<A HREF="s.html#cardigan">Space Aliens Laughed at My Cardigan</A> (also in SPAG 4), which had stated
that despite its flaws the game had some cult value, calling it
&quot;Infocom on acid&quot;.  I agreed with him, stating that Mystery Science
Theater 3000 had demonstrated that there were &quot;good&quot;  bad movies (which
provide loads of unintentional laughs), and &quot;bad&quot;  bad movies (which
were merely painful), and that Space Aliens was definitely a &quot;good&quot; bad
game.  He responded by comparing it to Detective, a &quot;bad&quot;  bad game,
that has no puzzles, and requires only compass directions to win.
     Now that I've played Detective, I'm not sure I agree.  I think
that it too is a &quot;good&quot; bad game.  Oh, it doesn't have the whacked-out
psychedelic Eraserhead surrealism of Space Aliens, but it has more than
its share of entertainment (not to mention equally bad spelling).
     I feel that I may owe a slight apology to <A HREF="e.html#electra">Electrabot</A>, which I
criticize for lack of plot.  Detective is like a stripped-down version
of Electrabot. Like Electrabot, it has a fairly linear path that you
must run, with several rooms of instant death, but at least Electrabot
had a Rogues Gallery of hostile characters who could be killed by
incongruous objects.  Detective only has one hostile character, who can
be easily bypassed.
     The game begins with your being told that the mayor has been
murdered and that you must solve the crime to avoid bad publicity (!!).
You can then go into the next room and get your gun.  The description
of the gun tells you that you only have 10 shots and should use them
wisely.  Fair enough, but no matter how many times you fire you will
still have 10 shots.
     Another interesting feature is what I call the closets of
teleportation. At one point you are in a hallway, with closets to the
east and west.  If you go east you will enter the west closet, and must
go east again to reenter the hallway (and vice versa).
     The few items generally have bizarre adjectives.  Along the way
you may acquire the &quot;food hamburger,&quot; and the &quot;wooden wood,&quot; though you
don't need any of them to win.
     Like Electrabot, Detective has several rooms that kill you without
warning when you enter, but Detective's are more interesting.  There is
one that I call &quot;The Room of Mysterious Death&quot;.  The description says
that you have reached a dead end and can go back west.  But you can't
because the game then proceeds to kill you without giving any
explanation.  In another instance, you are standing in a hallway and
see a door to the east marked &quot;Pool.&quot;  If you enter you are told that
you were in the pool when the killer shot you.  WHY the heck did I get
INTO the pool?  I just wanted to check out the room!!
     The game has a terrible (and amusing) problem with blending room,
object, and character descriptions with each other.  When you meet the
game's only character, the room description tells you all about what
he's doing. Which of course means that it keeps telling you even after
he's dead.  The description of the hamburger tells you that you should
just eat it and go north.  This is, of course only valid if you are
still in the room where you got it.  In another case, you see a knife
on the floor, but if you try to take it you are told &quot;What knife? 
There is no knife here.&quot;   It would have been easy enough to make the
knife takeable, or at least give a message saying that you don't need
it, or mustn't touch it because it hasn't been fingerprinted yet, or
something.  But this is much more amusing.
     The game can't seem to decide what time period it takes place in. 
In one room a passerby tells you to boycott FDR.  In the next, a
convict tells you he was busted for possession of crack.
     At another point, you enter an area and are told that the killer's
rumoured hotel is in one direction, his favourite hangout in another,
and his workplace in a third.  You never learned any of this
previously.  Real police work should be so easy.
     All of this is but a prelude to the big ending.  When you enter
the room where the killer is, you are told that after a fierce battle
you overcame him.  In other words, &quot;Yes, there was a big fight, but we
couldn't afford to show you any of it&quot;.
     I'm not going into all this detail just to pile on the criticism. 
Mr. Barringer obviously enjoys playing and writing text games, and I'd
be the last to tell him not to do it.  I'm only writing this because
unlike Stefan Jokisch (in his review), I think that you SHOULD get this
game and you SHOULD play it.  It's very quick (as little as 26 moves),
loaded with such unintentional laughs, and unlike Space Aliens, you can
play it to a conclusion, with no headaches or technical glitches.  The
parser is terrible, but when you only need &quot;north,&quot; &quot;south,&quot; &quot;east,&quot;
and &quot;west,&quot; what the heck? Mr. Barringer's goal in writing the game was
to entertain his audience, and as far as I'm concerned he suceeded in
ways that the rating system can't show.
     If you like Mystery Science Theater 3000, you will enjoy playing
this game.  I'm going to e-mail a copy to Dr. Clayton Forrester myself,
for use in a future experiment.  Heads up, Mike, Tom, and Crow!

Have you ever had the experience of seeing a movie or reading a book only

&quot;Detective&quot; which is probably the &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; of IF. (It's
not the worst piece of IF ever written by a long-shot but it may be the

I'm not entirely sure of the history of the game, beyond the author
uploading it to a BBS and things getting out of hand from there, but if
I'm not mistaken there are two ports of the original AGT game and two MST
versions. That may be some kind of record for a game held in such loving
low esteem.

I hadn't ever played it, so when I saw that Stuart Moore had created an
Inform version, I thought I'd take the time to play this and the so-called
MSTied version. Truth is, it's not that bad. It's not any kind of good,
either, because it's basically a puzzle-less IF piece without solid,
compelling writing to sustain it. Enough has been said about the program's
various faults (the lack of a proofreading, instant death, one way doors,
incidents built into room descriptions, near complete non-interactivity,
no story development beyond the original idea, incoherency and so on) that
the game could serve as a model on how not to write IF. 

I won't embellish on the game's faults here except to say that, having
known what to expect, I can't really share in the frustration that players
of the original AGT version must have experienced if they were looking for
a game.

It's short, arbitrary and pointless, but it *is* short! It may even be
historical. (Can you count yourself a true IF aficionado if you don't
know of this game?) It's also sincere in its way.  If you look at other
bad IF, you often find a cynicism, rampant insults to the player, and
sleazy bad humor. It's clear that the author's intentions are good.

Rating is somewhat problematic because (as outlined by Whizzard) the
ratings system deals with &quot;attempts&quot; and &quot;effort&quot; and I believe the
attempts and effort were there, just not successful. Nonetheless, I can't
really give a high score for &quot;trying&quot; except to bump up the &quot;overall&quot;
category somewhat.

  NAME:  DETECTIVE:  An Interactive MiSTing

     Normally, looking at the above category descriptions (such as
&quot;Trivial,&quot; &quot;Demented,&quot; and &quot;Pathetic&quot;) one would expect a pretty bad
game.  Yet, such is not the case here.  In the zany world of Mystery
Science Theater 3000, (MST3K for short) where schlock is fun, and all
involved want &quot;More cheese, please,&quot; such descriptions denote an
excellent game.  Detective, the game least likely to be ported, now
exists (with enhancements) for Inform.
     A little background is in order to understand this game.  SPAG #4 
featured a review of an AGT game called <A HREF="#detect">Detective</A>, which stated that
the author had made every possible mistake, and that the game should be
avoided.  In SPAG #5 I wrote a second review in which I stated that the
game, though awful, was in fact loaded with unintentional laughs and
bizarre incongruities that were sure to entertain the player, and that
the game would make an excellent episode of Mystery Science Theater
3000.
     For those who don't know, MST3K is a cable television show (soon to
be a major motion picture) on Comedy Central, that involves a man shot
into space by two mad scientists and forced to watch bad movies so that
his reactions can be monitored.  Throughout the movie we can see the
silhouettes of Mike and his robot companions (whose outer casings are
made out of things like a gumball machine, a bowling pin, and a
lacrosse helmet) at the lower right-hand corner of the screen, and hear
them deliver a barrage of sarcastic remarks, pop-culture references,
and suggested dialogue.  For example in Godzilla vs. Megalon, a
close-up of Godzilla waving his arms and bellowing drew the response &quot;I
am Kirok!!&quot;, a reference to a classic bit of Shatner overacting in Star
Trek's The Paradise Syndrome episode.  In Marooned, when three
astronauts, stranded in space are arguing over who will leave the ship
(there was only enough oxygen to sustain two until the rescue ship
arrived) one of the robots observed &quot;they could toss a coin, but it 
would never come down.&quot;
     The show is in its 7th season, and each episode is two hours long.
 Their bread-and-butter is schlocky sci-fi movies, but they have hit
almost every genre, including the occasional biker movie.  Before and
after the show, as well as during intermissions, they do short amusing
skits, often based on scenes from the movie.
     Chris Forman has taken this format and adapted it into a text
game, almost seamlessly.  The original Detective game has been
transferred verbatim to Inform, even retaining the AGT default
responses, and snappy responses from Mike and the robots have been
inserted everywhere; into room descriptions, item descriptions,
response descriptions, et cetera.  Repetition is avoided, enhancing
believability.  The first time you enter a room you get one set of
responses.  The second time you will get either a different set, or
none at all.  The jokes are generally top quality, turning an already
(unintentionally) amusing game into a laugh riot.  The level of
imitation is flawless; if you have seen the show, you can almost hear
the dialogue coming out of the actors' mouths.
    A typical MST3K episode features a short skit and an invention
exchange with the mad scientists before the movie actually begins.  Mr.
Forman has represented this by including a special introductory text
file that highlights the robots attempting to write their own text
games, and Dr. Forrester's &quot;fictionary,&quot; a device that inputs the
vocabulary of a text game directly into the player's mind, with
hilarious results.
     The only thing that could put anyone off about this game might be 
found in Stefan Jokisch's original SPAG review:  &quot;we should not forget that
Matt [the original author of Detective] wrote this game with good intentions
and he offered it for free, so who are we to mock at his efforts?&quot;
Matt Barringer's game is &quot;mocked&quot; here, but previous MST3K episodes have
had movies featuring the likes of Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, Linda Evans,
Peter Graves, James Earl Jones, and Bela Lugosi, putting Mr. Barringer
in very august company indeed.
     This may not be my all-time favourite text adventure, but it is
one of the few that I would recommend to absolutely everyone.

ATMOSPHERE: Precisely on target
WRITING: ROTFL!
CHARACTERS: Non-interactive
PLOT: Laughable, but that's the point
PUZZLES: Nonexistent, except for occasional sudden death
DIFFICULTY: Also nonexistent

Obviously inspired by Graeme Cree's review from SPAG #5, this is a
port of Matt Barringer's (infamous) AGT game <A HREF="#detect">_Detective_</A>, onto which
the cast of _Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_ has been grafted, providing
a Greek chorus that pokes hilarious fun at _Detective_'s shortcomings.
This was the first game that I returned to finish after my initial
ten minute look at each entry, and it succeeds brilliantly at the same
sort of appeal as the real MST3K.

Trying to evaluate this entry relative to the others in the division
was difficult.  However creative the writing may be, the fact remains
that this is not an original work of IF, which was the whole point of
the contest.  On the other hand, this entry also essentially defines
an entirely new genre: the interactive work of criticism.  Is it a
work of IF that happens to be critical or a work of criticism that
happens to be interactive?  And how much credit is due the author for
pioneering something as yet untried, especially given the much lower
level of technical difficulty in producing it?  In any case, comparing
this to the other entries is like comparing apples and oranges.

In the end, I wound up deciding to place this at the enjoyability
threshold, and score it behind any more technically difficult works
that succeeded at being entertaining, but ahead of any that didn't.
Had I been scoring for awards other than first, this would have
wound up taking second in its division, and certainly deserves an
honorable mention for its writing, but future works of this kind
will have to be crafted with great care to avoid becoming stale.

BOTTOM LINE: This is the entry most likely to continue to be
downloaded and played after the end of the contest; it's likely to
become a (cult) classic simply by being the preferred way to
experience the wonderful awfulness of _Detective_.  I can't wait to
see the crew take on <A HREF="s.html#cardigan">_Space_Aliens_Laughed_at_my_Cardigan_</A>!

  Name: Detective - an Interactive MiSTing / MST3K1
  Author: C.E. Forman
  Email: ceforman SP@G worldnet.att.net
                                          Parser: Hacked Inform
  Plot: See review                        Atmosphere: Demented

  Characters: See review                  Difficulty: Self-solving

This piece of IF is not really a game, but a commentary on a game -
or, as the author calls it, an Interactive MiSTing. The strange acronym
MST3K1 refers to &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000,&quot; a TV show that hasn't
reached the European networks, but this fact shouldn't scare away any
non-American readers, since the concept is made sufficiently clear
anyway (I had it explained to me by Whizzard after I played the game,
but I didn't really miss anything). 

Similar to the TV show, this game consists of the characters of
&quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot; playing - and commenting on - an existing
game: &quot;Detective&quot; by Matt Barringer. &quot;Detective,&quot; reviewed in SPAG 4,
is an amazingly bad game; basically, Barringer has committed every
possible mistake in writing it, even forgetting to put in any puzzles.

The core of &quot;MST3K1&quot; is a faithful re-implementation in Inform of
&quot<A HREF="#detect">Detective</A>,&quot; complete down to the last bug. As the player walks
through the game (and, believe me, walking through &quot;Detective&quot; is all
there is to winning it), he or she is treated to the commentary of the
MST characters. And this commentary is simply hilarious; together with
the unconscious comedy of the original &quot;Detective,&quot; the result must be
the funniest IF ever written. I'm exaggerating only slightly when
writing that &quot;MST3K1&quot; had me rolling on the floor with laughter.

Rating &quot;MST3K1&quot; according to the usual SPAG rules is of course
impossible, since the only game aspects are those of &quot;Detective,&quot; which
is a very very bad game. Suffice it to say that the &quot;MST&quot; part of the
writing is excellent, though the satire is perhaps a bit heavy-handed
in places - I sincerely hope that Matt Barringer has a sense of humour!

Finally, let me just step onto the soapbox for a minute to express
some concern. The immediate reaction to this program on Usenet was
something along the lines of &quot;Great idea! There are lots of bad games
out there; let's MiST them as well!&quot; I sincerely hope that these
people think not only once, but twice and thrice before starting to
write their own MiSTings. If nothing else, there's the simple rule of
all comedy: a good joke is extremely funny the first time it's told.
The second time, it's already old. The third time, it's routine. The
tenth time, people hate it. Let's not beat this excellent idea to
death by repeating it ad nauseam. 

Also, and far more seriously, the line between poking gentle fun at
something and cruelly mocking it is a fine one indeed. The present
author has managed to stay on the right side, but it takes
considerable skill to do so. We've all written things we're less than
proud of; even the good Homer nods. Indiscriminate derision of these
games - perhaps youthful first tries - could have disastrous
consequences for the small, fragile IF community. 

Of course, these words of warning should not reflect at all on the
present MiSTing; in fact, I think it's brilliant. Let's just not
pervert such a good idea.

  CHARACTERS: Unoriginal, but good        DIFFICULTY: Trivial

I'm only aware of &quot;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&quot; through the genre of
MST3k parodies on Usenet, so I have no idea how faithfully Christopher
Forman reproduced the flavour of the television program.  I thought that
this game was interesting as an experiment, and I did find bits of it
funny, but a lot of it was completely meaningless to me, especially the
introduction and the endgame, and I probably wouldn't play another
similar game.

I'm not sure at all that text adventure games are suitable for this kind
of parody by ridicule, and especially free or shareware games produced
by amateurs.  Bad films are interesting targets for ridicule because
they are the result of the labours of intelligent adults who should have
known better, and because millions of dollars were wasted on their
production.  On the other hand, &quot;<A HREF="#detect">Detective</A>&quot; was probably the result of a
couple of hours' work by a twelve-year-old kid, whose main mistake was
to upload it to a bulletin board for the world to laugh at (although the
adventure games I wrote when I was twelve were better than &quot;Detective,&quot;
I have more sense than to let anyone see them now!).  Activision's
expensive multimedia game &quot;Return to Zork,&quot; with live actors pretending
to be characters from an adventure game, would be a much more appropriate
(though also much more challenging) target.

I think that parody of adventure games is very tricky to do well,
because most adventure games sit rather uneasily on the dividing line
between seriousness and humour, and generally incorporate elements of
self-parody already (think of the ongoing Flathead jokes in the &quot;<A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork</A>&quot;
series, or the ridiculous names of the spells in &quot;<A HREF="e.html#enchant">Enchanter</A>&quot; et al),
whereas parody succeeds best when its target is relentlessly humourless
(think of &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; by Swift or &quot;The Pooh Perplex&quot; by
F.C.Crews).  There are some supposed parodies of Infocom games at the
IF-archive (&quot;Pork&quot; and &quot;Disenchanted&quot;), but they end up being pastiche
rather than parody or satire, and rather weak pastiches at that.

VERSION: Stuart Moore's Inform Port of the original MST3K IF.

Having survived &quot;<a href = "#detect">Detective</a>&quot; relatively unscathed, I then went on to play
the MST3K version of the game. As a rule, if someone is poking fun at
someone else's work, I tend to be more critical and keep a sharper eye out
for errors than otherwise, and right off the bat I noticed a few errors in
the game. 

For example, the game has &quot;role call&quot; instead &quot;roll call&quot;. Some of the
initial jokes don't display any greater creativity than the source
material. Also, the printing of the complete opening song from the MST3K
TV show is probably a copyright violation. After the initial scenes,
however, it's clear that the adaptation is more &quot;good-natured ribbing&quot;
than mean-spirited criticism, and it won me over.

You don't have to be a fan of the show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; or
of bad movies, but if you're not, a fair portion of the jokes will be lost
on you, and the introduction (which you can skip) may not make any sense
at all. Suffice to say that the text of the original game has been &quot;spiced
up&quot; with comments from characters (Mike Nelson and his two robots) who
watch as you play.

There is considerable creativity here, and the quality of the humor can
give you an appreciation for &quot;Detective&quot; that you may miss just playing it
&quot;straight&quot; (though I really think you should play it straight to begin
with). For example, I knew there were &quot;one-way&quot; doors in Detective, but I
never noticed them as the game was positively aggressive in telling me
which way I could go. Knowing how bad the game was, I never bothered to do
anything other than what the text was leading me to do.

But with the MST3K version, it becomes fun to open all the doors and see
what various deaths were planned. As they're all instant deaths, you can
just undo and go on playing along. Also things like trying to backtrack
and go in circles pays off when Mike and the 'bots riff on the &quot;scenery&quot;
not reflecting your most recent actions.  (At one point, you shoot a guy
and his body vanishes, but he's still in the room description.)

Personally, I think that any game, movie, or work of literature can be
given this sort of treatment.  (I've always wanted to see Mike and the
'bots do &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.)  But a game like &quot;Detective&quot; gets a new lease on
life from efforts like this, and reminds us how to laugh...and love
again*. (*A quote from the show and the interview of Matt Barringer by
C.E. Forman.)

To rate the game, I've used the adapted text wherever possible to
influence the ratings I gave detective. Since the MST3K version didn't add
any puzzles (an intriguing notion were someone to pick it up), I didn't
alter its score. Also, if you don't know the show, the atmosphere,
characters and plot will probably work less well, since the game relied
heavily on these known characters and spent little time explaining them.

PARSER: TADS
SUPPORTS: TADS interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Currently unavailable -- pulled from comp
VERSION: comp release

Score: 3 of 10.

The premise of this game: you are a teenage female drow who has been
captured by four warlords. You are now a prisoner in the castle, but, if
you "please" (author's wording, not mine!) all of the warlords, you will
be allowed to go free. This sounds significantly more pornographic than
it actually is.

In her introduction, the author notes, "Interactive fiction was just a
stone&#8217;s throw for me, being an author by nature." As upbeat as this
approach may be, it is simply not enough. I, too, have written my share
of fiction, but the requirements of good interactive fiction are
significantly different than the requirements of good writing. I cannot
speak to the author's regular fiction, but this was simply not
sufficient. At this point, what "Die Vollkommene Masse" actually needed
was a massive round of NPC-fleshing followed by a lot of beta-testing.

I didn't mind the menu-based conversation system except when it
exploded. Time after time, I found myself stuck with only one option for
conversation and able to enter that option over and over and over ad
infinitum. The major NPCs were all quite active when I was in the room
with them, which I appreciated -- it gave me a very good sense of their
general personalities -- and having one travel from place to place was a
nice touch. However, the NPCs were quite unresponsive when offered
objects, giving me the same response over and over, which left me
failing to offer them the correct objects for the plot because I had no
reason to believe that they would react in any different way than the
default.

Others will doubtlessly disagree with me, but I liked the feature of
listing the exits to the rooms -- it kept me from getting lost. While
realism obviously took a step to the wayside in organizing the layout of
the castle, I didn't mind that, either. I object to getting lost, and I
didn't get lost; I dislike mapping, and I didn't have to map (even
without checking the maps that she rather graciously included.) That was
good. Some of the rooms had very nice descriptions, too; I particularly
liked one line about how moonlight cast a milky glow around the room.
Some of them had virtually no descriptions, or else had no actual
substance save a list of objects (a dresser, a desk, a bed, etc.) That
was annoying.

Red herring objects: there were tons of them. I like the idea of lots of
objects in a game, as it helps deflect the traditional adventurer's
kleptomaniac tendencies, and I don't mind if they don't have an apparent
purpose. However, this only holds true if they are adequately fleshed
and implemented. These were not. As a general rule, the NPCs didn't care
about them, and I couldn't do anything with them. (Why hand me a sword
if you don't want me to kill people with it? At least let me try!)

Serious bugs existed in this game, mostly related to differentiating one
object from another. I wound up carrying around two copies of an object
at one point without any ability whatsoever to affect either one because
the game kept asking me which one I meant and they were identically
named. I also discovered a number of mystery objects when the game asked
me which one I meant in a peculiar fashion -- for example, ">examine
window" led to "Which window do you mean, the window, or the ?" Argh.

There were also a number of serious plot issues, all of which were
heavily linked to the questionable morality and attitudes of the PC. The
premise wasn't bad, but the implementation made me scream. My best (and
least spoileresque) example is this: Very early in the game, I wandered
outside the castle. Although the window of my fifth-story bedroom had
been barred to prevent my escape, there were no guards in sight here.
Super! Let's go! --but, I couldn't leave, because I didn't feel ready.
This made and still makes no sense to me... in fact, the PC's
ambivalence toward her captors bugged the heck out of me through the
entire game. As far as I could tell, this wasn't a horrible prison for
her, but a secret wish fulfillment fantasy in which she was the happy
star as long as she could pretend that she didn't like it. The game
warns in its beginning that it involves mature themes, but it doesn't.
It involves an immature approach to potentially mature themes, which was
quite disappointing. 

The introductory document promises that the game is mind-numbingly
difficult. I will agree, but only because the author did not fully
implement and flesh out her game. Given adequate incentive to explore
and experiment with the NPCs, I could have finished this game quite
swiftly and experienced minimal difficulty with the puzzles, as many of
them were of a fetch-and-carry variety. As it was... no, I could not
have solved it without a walkthrough... because I had no incentive to do
so.

The errors in spelling and grammar may not have been obtrusive to other
people, but I found them annoying ("inticing", "There's nothing behind
the Mbizi's bed"). The references to Mbizi's "shrunk" left me wondering
if English was the author's native language -- the appropriate word
seemed to be "trunk", but "shrunk" was the word repeatedly used instead
by the author. If English isn't her native language, she did cover it
quite well through 97% of the game, but the "shrunk" issue was bizarre.

Partway through the game, I got tired and fell asleep. (The PC, not me.)
Why? It was apparently night in the game, and I had been playing for
quite some time, so I was willing to believe that the PC would fall
asleep... but there seemed to be no point to it. This interlude could
have been used in a very interesting fashion for a dream sequence or
something similar, but she fell asleep, then woke up. There was no point
to it.

In closing, does anyone understand the meaning of the title? I am at a
perfect loss as to how "The Perfect Mass" (as the author translates "Die
Volkommene Masse") has anything at all to do with the game.

Quite a time ago, I read an article in a sports newspaper comparing the two
German football players, the famous Karl-Heinz Rummenige and his younger
brother Michael. Well, I can't vouch for the exactness of the following
quotation, because more than ten years strolled past since then; however, in
the section dedicated to the brothers' manner of dribbling, it said something
like, "Karl-Heinz can get past a couple of backs after gaining a good speed in
an open space. Michael is an entirely different type of player -- he can make
fools of four or five opponents 'on a handkerchief'".

The latter can be applied to Distress: the game is tiny -- slightly more than
ten rooms, most of which you run by in a rush, but it manages to unwind an
intricate plot with an ending, which manages both to be immensely satisfying
and to neatly tie up all loose ends. And it's not too wordy, either -- but  the
reticent descriptions are just long enough to create a truly creepy atmosphere.
The puzzles also are set up with a minimum of items to manipulate, yet they are
both challenging and logical.

It's been said the game sometimes restricts the player's actions in a manner
that may appear a little blatant to some people, but, to be honest, I only
learned about this issue from other reviews -- the restrictions seemed
perfectly reasonable for me when I was actually playing.

As you may have guessed already, this is my favourite entry in this year Comp.
Finally, I'd like to explain why I ranked it higher than, say, the actual
winner of the contest, <a href="v.html#vespers">Vespers</a> (a disclaimer right off -- it's not my intention
to set anybody at loggerheads or to start a flame war).

Vespers is a splendid, wonderful game -- but it calls heavies into play where
Distress does with minimalist resources. Now, who is greater a commander -- a
general capturing a town by force of a brigade after days of preparatory
bombardment and carpet bombings, or a lieutenant infiltrating it with a small
troop by stratagem, and managing to sabotage the garrison to an extent it can't
put up a proper resistance?

SNATS:

PLOT: Outstanding, with an immensely satisfying ending (1.6)
ATMOSPHERE: Ominous (1.7)
WRITING: Masterfully terse (1.7)
GAMEPLAY: Gripping (1.6)
BONUSES: The ability of being expressive with minimalist means (1.2)
TOTAL: 7.8
CHARACTERS: You can't converse with them -- in every other respect, they are
            faultless (1.4)
PUZZLES: Best in this review package (1.3)
DIFFICULTY: Fairly challenging (6 out of 10)

COMP SCORE: 10

COMMENTS: Well, this has been my favourite game in the Comp, so I had to give
          it a ten. A typical case of a "normalizing effect" in scoring (I'm
          afraid that without this normalization, hardly any game would get
          more than an 8 from me for a very long time, because of <a href="b.html#blue">Blue Chairs</a>
          being entered in the previous Comp).

     You are a student at the CalTech University. Today is &quot;Ditch Day&quot; 
where the senior students set up &quot;stacks&quot; (problems) for the under-
graduates to break. Your stack will send you all over the university,
from the book store over the Explosive Lab to the excavations under the
campus. Be prepared to meet vigilant guards and failed biological
experiments!
     The game takes you into a realistic university atmosphere with just
a small bit of overstatement to make you smile. Most of the NPCs are
cardboard characters, but the insurance robot Lloyd is well-developed. I
also like the book store clerk. None of the NPCs are very conversational
though. The puzzles are fairly easy, but all logical and well-thought-
out. This makes the game an excellent introduction to IF. The veteran
gamer will complete the game very quickly, but should still play the
game for its story. The puzzles are rather independent, which on the
other hand makes the plot a bit loose (solving one of the independent
puzzles doesn't make the overall story advance much).
     The source code to &quot;Ditch Day Drifter&quot; is distributed together with
introductory documentation to TADS. Since this is meant to be read by
people who have not (yet) registered TADS I guess it can be called
free.

VERSION: Release 2

J.D. Berry's Djinni Chronicles is one of the shortest games of the comp,
but it's also one of the densest--there's not much room for exploration
or experimentation without save-restore. There are some game-specific
rules, moreover, that make it likely that you'll have to do some
save-restoring. Still, there are some ideas worth exploring that come
across in those few moves.

You are a djinni, discovered and summoned by various masters, whose
wishes you strive to grant in one way or another--but you also have your
own purposes that are only somewhat compatible with those of your
masters. The nature of your existence is such that you can't stray far
from your "container," the vessel where you reside when you're not about
your business; indeed, the beginning of the game functions mostly as an
introduction to the rules of your world. You learn, for example, that
the tendency of wishes to come with unfortunate side effects isn't
simply djinni contrariness; rather, it's because they don't (generally)
have the power to accomplish the change by their own will, and have to
harness the power of another "undercurrent" with somewhat different
effects. You also learn that some djinni derive power from sources other
than their summoners, and seek to gain enough power to act
independently. The defining measure is known as "Purpose," here
expressed as a number, and maintaining Purpose, one way or another,
becomes your overriding goal. What emerges is an imaginative portrait of
djinni ethics, as it were: the djinni that you play aren't bound by any
particular ethical norms as such other than the desire to gain and
maintain purpose. Arguably, those djinni that aren't bent on destruction
serve their masters' wishes not out of any sense of loyalty, but simply
because they derive no advantage from acting independently. (The
anterior question, why some djinni are one way and some are another,
isn't addressed, but the game is complex enough; there's no need to
introduce another layer of cosmology.)

In a sense, the path of the game is fairly well defined simply because
the character's powers are limited; the player can't really expect to be
able to wander away, since that causes the game to end promptly. The
wishes of your masters also define your goals most of the time, and when
they don't, the game spells out your personal objective. And yet
figuring out your motivations at any given point can be complicated,
particularly if you assume that you feel some inherent responsibility to
your master--and it's not until about halfway through the game that you
learn what you're really doing, so to speak. Once you understand the
larger plot, it's intriguing; the only problem is that you don't have
much part in influencing where it'll go, other than figuring out the
command that will move things along. The linearity factor actually
serves the purposes of the story--the whole point is that your powers
are limited, and your ability to influence events doesn't go much beyond
your master's interests--but it might also be a bit more satisfying to
be able to affect how the plot turns out, not just whether the one
possible plotline progresses.

The end of the game suggests that the point isn't simply to devise an
inventive mythology of djinni and how they work and what motivates them;
rather, the behavior of the djinni suggests something about human nature
and the ways that these particular spirits (with their own motivations)
choose to manipulate their masters. In that respect, portraying the
details of djinni existence serves some of the same function that C.S.
Lewis's elaborate bureaucracy of hell did in Screwtape Letters: to
describe the spirit world in order to provide a context for the way
those spirits tempt and manipulate humans. Obviously, this is a little
different, since the relationship isn't entirely adversarial--you need
your masters to accomplish your purposes, which doesn't exactly describe
Screwtape--but the message is related: suitable manipulation of our
baser instincts can turn them into enormously destructive forces, and
the game suggests that the less noble impulses are considerably more
powerful than altruistic ones (since the djinni that serves a master
with relatively unselfish goals doesn't seem to accumulate much
Purpose).

As a game, apart from the theory and theology that might underlie it,
Djinni Chronicles works reasonably well. As noted, picking up on the
rules takes a while, and the limitations on the character are initially
frustrating when you're used to a great deal of freedom--but it doesn't
take long to adjust and to appreciate your new powers. (For instance,
walls are no hindrance.) The game is quite linear, true, but to some
extent that's inevitable if the author wants to tell a particular story
about the spirit world and human nature: if the player has the power to
put a different spin on the relationship between the PC and its masters,
the result is no longer what the author set out to tell. This sort of
thing might not have gone over well just a few years ago, but linearity,
I think, has come to be viewed as the inevitable price of more
story-oriented IF, and when the story is as intriguing as this one, it's
a price worth paying. There's another advantage to the linearity: the
puzzles are well integrated into the plot, rather than artificial
constructs that distract from the story. That's a feature not directly
related to the breadth of the game, of course, but it's inevitable that
a game with a large field of options doesn't really sustain much of a
story, since the author can't exercise much control over how the game
progresses--and by restricting the options, Djinni Chronicles ensures
that the task at hand is always part of the story. Moreover, the
linearity factor restricts the amount of things that can go wrong; this
is a technically solid game, in part, perhaps, because the nature of the
game prevents players from doing outlandish things that could violate
the game's expectations. The only real fly in the ointment is a lengthy
section that's written in not especially inspired verse; it doesn't
serve an obvious purpose in the game, and it distracts the player from
what was otherwise highly competent writing.

The main flaw in Djinni Chronicles, at the end, is that it leaves the
player wanting more--more plot, more character development--but there
are worse sins, I suppose. It's an imaginatively told story--intelligent
enough to earn a 9 from me.

TITLE: Dr. Dumont's Wild P.A.R.T.I.
AUTHOR: Text, script and design by Muffy and Michael Berlyn
        Inform translation by Mark J. Musante and Michael Berlyn
        Hints by Gunther Schmidl.
EMAIL: ???
VERSION: 4.11
DATE: May 5, 2000
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-code (Inform) interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF-Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/dumont.z5">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/dumont.z5</a>

The premise of Dr. Dumont's Wild P.A.R.T.I. is that you're a student
whose off-kilter physics professor has built a combination particle
accelerator and A.I. computer. The computer needs a human observer in
order to find and view Particle X, a new subatomic particle. Dr. Dumont
asks you to sit in the interface shell, just to take some measurements,
but of course you accidentally activate the linkage and get plunged into
the metaphorical virtual reality the computer creates for you. In order
to get out again, you have to help the A.I. view Particle X.

Dr. Dumont's Wild P.A.R.T.I. was originally written for Infocom but, due
to Infocom's demise, was released by another company in the late 80s.
When the Berlyns started their own company in 1999, it was updated and
re-released as a commercial, download-only product. Then they went out
of business, too, and this game was finally released as freeware. The
original manual and "feelies" (artifacts from the game world, including
a kite race flyer you'll need to solve a puzzle) are included as PDF
files in the same if-archive directory as the game file.

Due to its long history as a commercial product, I expected playing this
game to be an extremely polished experience. Unfortunately, there were
some sloppy elements. For example, there is an object you gain at one
point that, when in use, renders you unable to go anywhere or examine
objects because you "can't see much". However, you're perfectly able,
somehow, to see the same room description as always and to read a
banner.

Another sloppy piece is that there is an object you need to alter in
order to finish the game successfully. Reading its description carefully
will tell you what it really is. However, when you find it in the room
and when you see it in your inventory, it is named inaccurately, as
though it were already in the state to which you are meant to change it.
This worked to prevent me from realizing that I needed to alter it until
I checked the hints.

A third object needed to be made to turn through some complicated
manipulations of the environment. However, when I tried "turn"ing it
before doing any of those manipulations, I was told it was already
turning. That was very confusing -- if it's already turning, I thought,
then why isn't it making this other thing work?

In addition, the kite race seems not like an integral part of the game,
but a tacked-on puzzle originally meant as a low-tech copy protection
scheme. To win the kite race, you had to have the information on the
flyer. Since the flyer was included in the physical package of the 80s
version of the game (it's now part of the .PDF "feelies" file),
presumably you had to buy the game and not copy it from a friend's
floppy disk. (There is even a jab in the in-game hints section to this
effect.) Because there were no photocopy machines in 1988, of course, or
even pens, you couldn't have just gotten the hint from your friend's
copy. The flyer exists as a game object, including the text that says
instructions on how to win the race are on the reverse, but there is no
in-game way to turn over the flyer and read the reverse side. The game
doesn't even anticipate that we'll try this, and tell us we can't.

Anyway, if you try to play the kite race puzzle without this
information, you will think that you are following the kite, based on
the motions the kite makes in the course. However, the game will tell
you that the kite "takes off to the north, then heads off to the south."
So you will go south, and the kite may not be there, or it may not be
possible to go that way. When you follow the path that using the flyer
hint gives you, the way the game says the kite goes will not always
match the path you take, yet it will be there with you in the next room
of the puzzle, and you will still win. And when you reach the end of
that path, you will expect that something "You've won"-ish should
happen, but it will not until you leave the course, so you may flounder
about thinking you've misunderstood the hint. You haven't. It's just a
weird puzzle.

There are other annoyances. You have to play guess-the-verb with a duck,
and you may not "toss" a ring despite being at a Ring Toss. You will
have to cause something to reach a precise state without going too far,
and even though you should be able to judge it by "touch"ing or
"feel"ing it, you can't. The game will tell you you are standing outside
a building, and then will not allow you to look at that building. There
is a door with no purpose but to make you open it before you walk
through -- it isn't even locked. And in order to get more information
from the game about the puzzles by using the "meditate" verb, you have
to go through a series of three actions, meditate, and then reverse the
steps before you can carry on with the game, every time. It's tedious --
it'd be nice if, once you figured out how to meditate, the process could
be automatic!

But my biggest disappointment with this game was something a little less
nitpicky. This game's premise and atmosphere are very cool. You get the
impression that in playing this game, you're going to be immersed in
particle physics, philosophy, astronomy, metaphysics and the Marx
brothers. In short, you feel like you're about to learn a little
something. The game doesn't deliver. The School of Thought is just a
place to pick up some objects. The Science Art Museum is just a place to
get some objects. The Planetarium is just a place to get some more
objects. The professor NPC's don't know anything about their subjects
and can barely converse at all. The A.I. is waiting for you to solve its
problem for it. You might learn a little about the Milky Way at the
fair, but that's about it. This is a puzzlefest wrapped up in an
Einstein poster. It looks cool and makes you feel smart, but ultimately,
it's just a paper-thin diversion.

The demise of the game publishing house that re-released Dr. Dumont's
Wild P.A.R.T.I. in the late 90s should not be taken as proof that
selling commercial IF is no longer a workable business model. Maybe it
isn't, but maybe if the product they were selling had been an
outstanding, polished, bug-free game, a game that made people think and
talk and tell their friends "hey, you've got to try this," things might
have worked out.

It's worth playing for a couple of the puzzles, and the fun atmosphere.
The prose is lively and engaging, which is why it sets up such
unrealistic expectations. If the careless bugs and annoyances I
mentioned above were fixed, it would have gotten an 8 from me. But as it
is, I'll rate it a 6.


From: Valentine Kopteltsev &lt;uux SP@G mail.ru&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag37.html">SPAG #37</a> -- July 10, 2004

I've got to warn you -- the chief motive power behind this review is my
spirit of contradiction. It began as I came across the blurb for Dr.
Dumont in Baf's Guide, which contained, among other things, statements
like "one of the most bizarre examples of true IF ever published", and
"recommended for those who found <a href = "t.html#trinity">Trinity</a> too tame". I disagree with
these statements, but the Trinity comparison gave me a reference point
to compare Dr. Dumont's Wild P.A.R.T.I. with. I'd rather apply the
second of the quotes above to Graham Nelson's <a href = "j.html#jigsaw">Jigsaw</a>, so let's make that
a reference point, too.

Along with the reasons adduced above, using Trinity and Jigsaw as
criteria is justified by the fact that these works all feature a
similar structure: in all three games, the player character starts in
his habitual environment, and then lands, whichever way, in some surreal
place. These places, in their turn, also share a rather similar layout:
a core area (a "central trans-shipping point") that contains several
portals leading to more (fairly varied) worlds. However, there is a
significant difference in game size; for instance, Dr. Dumont manages to
squeeze the prologue, implemented as a mini-game in both classics
referenced, into its (admittedly quite long) opening text, and to shrink
the aforementioned "central trans-shipping point" to a single room. To
avoid rather overused metaphors about meal- and snack-sized games, let's
put it this way: while Jigsaw reminds one of a stretched Bentley, and
Trinity a Jaguar, Dr. Dumont is (let's stay with European cars) a
Volkswagen Passat at best -- the only thing about it bigger than that of
the others is its title. ;)

Sure, a shorter game still can compete with a longer one in toughness --
for instance, by being bizarre. I don't deny that Dr. Dumont's main
theme contains an enormous peculiarity potential; particle physics is
quite a mind-bending matter itself, and all the more so is the idea of
connecting a human brain to a particle-detection-oriented AI -- one
could go off one's head just by trying too hard to imagine the results.
In spite of this, though, the game didn't appear that odd. It rather
reminded me of a draftee attempting to convince the medical board at the
recruiting station that he's crazy in order to avoid conscription into
the army. Yes, there were pretty many grotesque, comically distorted
details and decorations -- and yet, the puzzles had perfectly logical
solutions, and the major subgoals were formulated clearly and
unambiguously, sometimes even a bit straightforwardly. Well, maybe not
that straightforwardly, because some aspects of the game are downright
confusing.

To begin with, unlike Jigsaw and Trinity, Dr. Dumont allows the player
to get into all the areas accessible through the "central trans-shipping
point" from the very start of the game -- due to its relatively small
size, it can afford to do so without becoming totally unwinnable.
However, the player gets most of the information crucial for success in
only one of these areas, and thus should visit it first, since roaming
through the other areas without having the goals in the game formulated
is rather misleading indeed. As the game contains no hints about in
which order the areas should be visited, one is left to find it out
oneself by trial and error.

Secondly, Dr. Dumont comes with a bunch of feelies in the style of
Infocom. And, like some of the Infocom games (though not Trinity), the
player needs to refer to these feelies to win. This could be quite
confusing for people who don't have much experience with commercial IF,
even despite the fact that Dr. Dumont provides quite a clear inkling at
the point where the feelies are needed. One more confusing aspect of the
game is the 'how to play' documentation that accompanies it. Most of the
experienced players probably will ignore this documentation completely,
since it appears to be addressed to novices, and as far as I remember
Dr. Dumont makes no effort to dispel this impression. The thing is, this
documentation describes, along with the usual (and trivial) directives
like LOOK, TAKE, etc., a few less obvious commands, which are crucial
for success. A typical case of RTFM. ;)

Finally, there indeed are a couple of slightly obscure puzzles (like a
quiz requiring some basic astronomical knowledge). But even with all
these issues, Dr. Dumont still isn't half as tough as Trinity, not to
mention Jigsaw: no Enigmas, no careful, turn-precise pre-planning of
your actions, no random hints disguised as gibberish... sheer
disappointment for a true puzzle-fan! ;)

As everybody knows, there is no direct dependence between a game's size
and its difficulty or its depth. For the reviewed game, however, this
relationship is true: Dr. Dumont indeed hasn't got the vast
philosophical background Trinity possesses; in fact, it's entirely
light-hearted. This doesn't mean, however, a quality decrease: splendid
writing, consistently high level of detail, carefully implemented
characters, and a state-of-the-art hint system are a sufficient warranty
against disappointment. In fact, these features work so well that the
game even failed to frustrate me after I had to restart it three times
because I run into an unwinnable state due to bugs. These glitches
really were of the "very difficult to locate" kind; I think 95 percent
or more of the players will never encounter them. This, along with the
realization of my bad luck and the fact that redoing the game from the
start wasn't too torturous thanks to its not so large size, helped me to
avoid fixating on these problems too much.

To sum things up, if it's appropriate to speak about the image a game is
trying to form of itself, so Dr. Dumont doesn't act like a super-epic
breaking bizarrity records, and outshining classics; rather, it modestly
tries to entertain the player for a few evenings with good puzzles and
healthy humour. Quite unambitious, isn't it? ;)

SNATS [Scores Not Affecting The Scoreboard]:

PLOT:       Sufficient for a game emphasizing puzzles, and with clearly
            defined subgoals (1.0)
ATMOSPHERE: Makes the game appear more surreal than it really is (1.4)
WRITING:    The opening text impressed me a lot; later on, I got used to
            the quality of the prose, and took no notice of it, but one
            has got to admit it plays a very important role in
            determining Dr. Dumont's appearance (1.5)
GAMEPLAY:   As you might have guessed from the comment for the PLOT, it
            stresses puzzles, and has got its subgoals defined clearly.
            ;) (1.2)
BONUSES:    Lots of optional stuff to do, feelies (1.2)
TOTAL:      6.3

CHARACTERS: Nice, but fairly conventional (1.3)
PUZZLES:    Range from "very logical" to "slightly obscure" (1.3)
DIFFICULTY: Not without its snags, but manageable (6 out of 10)

This is the first ALAN game by someone other than the authors (that

acceptance of the verb &quot;TAKE,&quot; but not of &quot;GET,&quot; for instance), but
you'll finish it in perhaps 15 minutes anyway.  There's nothing
inherently wrong with it, it's just really short and really simplistic.
I'd give a higher score if it were a bit more substantial.

Hmm.  Not much else to say.

Eric Mayer's first ADRIFT game, <a href = "l.html#lostadrift">Lost</a>, was a strange one with little or
no plot -- playable and even kind of likeable but hardly the sort of
thing that was ever going to be remembered. His second, Doomed
Xycanthus, is a far different sort of game. It's larger, with more
details and a more complex plot, and overall a far better game.

As Doomed Xycanthus starts, you are in the midst of a forest with no
memory as to how you arrived there and little or no idea of what to do
next. Following a brief fight with a "nightmare creature", you discover
a gem embedded in your left hand and a brief note from a wizard by the
name of Malevol. It appears Malevol has cursed you with forgetfulness
and dumped you in the middle of nowhere as payback for stealing his
daughter's virtue. So starts the game.

I have to confess that after the beginning, I was surprised to find that
the aforementioned Malevol the wizard did not make another appearance. I
was half expecting Doomed Xycanthus to turn out to be a
hunt-the-wizard-and-exact-your-revenge sort of game but instead it turns
out to be more a hunt for treasure in the city of the game's title.
While this is no bad thing in itself -- the storyline as you wander
around the wilderness outside Xycanthus and then subsequently inside the
ruined city itself is well written and has impressive depth -- I was
anticipating Malevol at every moment. When the game finished and there
was no sign of him, I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed. The
game reaching a conclusion without any kind of appearance from the evil
wizard left me feeling as if matters hadn't been properly resolved.

That isn't to say that Doomed Xycanthus is a bad game -- far from it. It
has some intricate puzzles -- the one involving the snake and the pool
is an interesting one (if a little on the overly-complicated side), as
well as the letters which allow you access to the ruined city -- and the
locations are often lengthy and detailed. The style of writing is
overall very impressive, lending the game an eerie atmosphere,
particularly during the times when you wander around the city of
Xycanthus itself.

One aspect of the game I found frustrating -- and something that,
thankfully, seems to be getting rarer and rarer in text adventures these
days -- is its zeal to kill the player off for making a single bad move.
Sometimes there are warnings about what will happen if you go a certain
way but more often than not these warnings are subtle to the point that
they will most likely be missed, leaving the poor player to have to
reload time and time again. Often, after I'd died and started again, I
was able to spot the warnings and avoid them subsequent times but it was
still frustrating being killed for doing nothing more than moving in the
wrong direction. Maybe this isn't such a bad thing as it encourages you
to read the location descriptions more carefully than you might normally
do and anyone who just rushes through this game without reading where
he/she is going is liable to wind up dead more than a few times.

All in all, this is a well above average game that suffers from a little
too much guess-the-verb (the puzzle involving the statue is an unusual
one that it is doubtful you would manage to guess without the hints) but
the standard of writing and the atmospheric location descriptions more
then compensate for any shortcomings. From the ending I would have
guessed that this was the first part in a series of adventures (hints
are given that you're going to set off after Malevol the wizard) but as
nothing has come out in the months since then it seems unfortunately not
which is a pity because this is the sort of game we see too little of.

VERSION: Release 1

Kent Tessman's Down deserves credit for one of the most original
settings of the competition, and for a plot that's quite
compelling. The implementation of Down doesn't live up to the premise,
unfortunately, but the idea--setting IF in the midst of a disaster
without veering into camp or action-movie yarn--merits another look.

The story of Down--mild spoilers here, since it isn't really possible
to review this without giving some stuff away--puts you, the
protagonist, on a hill near a plane crash with a broken leg and,
apparently, amnesia, since presumably you were in the plane at some
point and you have no memory of it. Or do you, and the game just
doesn't say as much? At any rate, you first see to your leg and then
to the crash. Admittedly, several of your actions are not entirely
logical, but the game is reasonably enjoyable with disbelief
suspended: the writing conveys a degree of urgency, and the plot
devices, even if not wildly original, work the way they're supposed
to.

There are some problems as well, though. While, as noted, you have a
sense of limited time, it isn't quite limited enough--there is way
more than enough time to do everything needed, and nothing of
consequence happens before time runs out to show that you need to
hurry things along. The plot is a little murky in parts, most
importantly in explaining how you got into this mess, though arguably
having to wade through backstory would just slow things down for the
player. Similarly, the scene is a tad underdescribed--you're told
there are survivors around, but not how many, how badly hurt they are,
etc.--and, likewise, while piling on description would have weakened
the tension (since a rescuer typically doesn't bother to examine every
blade of grass), some more would have been nice to make the setting
more vivid. And though most of the illogicalities aren't fatal, the
final action seemed unlikely enough that I needed the walkthrough, and
another key object was described in a somewhat misleading way. Hugo,
for its part, comes off reasonably well, though some of the
disambiguation queries were a tad bizarre.

The appeal of Down, though, lies less in its technical success than in
its good intentions, since it does try hard to do something relatively
new for IF. The puzzles are sufficiently integrated into the story
that they don't disrupt the plot; there is very little sense that the
author decided to slow the story down by throwing in puzzles here and
there. There are several nice touches that reinforce the story,
moreover, for example the couple you find near the plane--some might
see the inclusion as pointless, but it gave the proceedings an element
of realism. Your cracked watch at the beginning presages the rest of
the game effectively. And despite certain improbabilities in the
nature of the ending, it did avoid an easy everything's-fine approach,
certainly a welcome detail, and the general suspense level show that a
little danger and a time limit go a long way.

Even though, as with many suspense-type stories, much of Down is
better experiened than thought about, it's a reasonably solid entry
that does most of what it sets out to do. As with most of the
competition entries, it needs some work--but it's not a bad effort.

VERSION: Release 1

Perhaps 1998 was the year that authors gave up on text alone and
resorted to other means of keeping players involved--<a href = "a.html#arrival">Arrival</a> and <a href = "p.html#plant">The
Plant</a> used HTML-TADS graphics and sound effects, <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> used a color
scheme, some others (<a href = "e.html#enlight">Enlightenment</a>, <a href = "m.html#muse">Muse</a>) used .gif files external to
the game. And then there was Downtown Tokyo, Present Day, which
featured some dramatic moments rendered in...ASCII art. On the other
hand, the drawings fit the tone of the game nicely, which is a cross
between spoof of and homage to old B movies, and the whole effect is
rather enjoyable.

There's one interesting experiment going on that doesn't,
unfortunately, work as well as it might: the player inhabits both the
protagonist and a movie-theater onlooker, and commands sometimes are
directed to the viewer persona rather than the protagonist persona
without warning. Part of the reason it doesn't entirely work is that
the protagonist's actions are all in the third person--&quot;our hero
enjoys a long slurp of soup&quot;--but some of the library responses
trickle in now and again. To be sure, it's pretty hard to keep that
from happening, but it also doesn't take much of it to break the
spell. (On the other hand, it reminded me of the actual experience of
being in movie theaters--being absorbed in what's happening on the
screen and suddenly having the spell broken, either by a flaw in the
film itself or by some distraction in the theater. If that was the
intent, it's quite well done.) Then again, I'm not sure there's a
better way to keep the viewer and the protagonist distinct, and if
they're not distinct, this could turn into a &quot;you're sucked into the
movie&quot; game, which wouldn't be a tenth as interesting. It's a flawed
experiment, but it's not a bad idea.

The plot is minimal, and it's to the game's credit that the whole
thing is rather casual about the story--plenty of room for even
time-sensitive actions, and the story essentially stops in the middle
so that you can wander around and have fun. This is the sort of thing
I'd disapprove in most IF but which works just fine here, since
B-movies don't exactly set a high realism standard and it's so much
fun to play with the toys you're given. Indeed, this middle section
(if you can call it that in such a tiny game) is the best thing about
Downtown Tokyo; the beginning and end come off more as quotations,
homages, than as parodies, and the parody is much more fun. The author
provides for plenty of silly actions, logical and not. Still, even if
you're inclined to try those silly things, this won't detain you for
more than 10 or 15 minutes, and there isn't much reason to come back
to it. Adding to the fun is the satire: the author claims never to
have seen a monster movie, but he has a good feel for Hollywood
cliches anyway. At the end, for example, when the hero and heroine are
together, we learn that &quot;their clothes are alluringly torn,&quot; pointing
to the way films like to fuse danger and sex. Likewise, when people
fall, they fall in slow motion, so that you have plenty of time to
react.

The only real problem with Downtown Tokyo is that it doesn't work
particularly well as a game. At the outset, for instance, you can do
essentially nothing for about 20 turns; so determined is the author to
make fun of the plot contrivances that he doesn't let you interfere
with them, logic be damned. The controls in the helicopter you end up
flying around are rather nonintuitive--at least, the initial hurdle to
overcome is a little strange. It's also distinctly possible to get
lost in the city--the unimportant locations don't loop back, so you
can wander very far away from the relevant scene. It wouldn't have
broken too much with logic to keep the player from wandering away
(&quot;You can't leave now. Your reputation as a hero as at stake.&quot;). As it
is, the game provides some cute satirical moments but not much more.

There isn't a lot to Downtown Tokyo, Present Day, but what's there is
pretty funny; the author manages to spoof old monster movies in a
variety of ways. This was intended for the chicken- comp, and it would
have been among the better entries had it been entered. As it was, in
the real competition, I gave it a 6.


From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag17.html">SPAG #17</a> -- May 10, 1999

Another very short (TextFire-length) game, Tokyo was originally
intended for submission to Adam Cadre's Chicken-Comp, but the author
didn't finish it in time. All the better for us, because the game is
funny and entertaining, and still finds a little time to be innovative
as well. With a game this short, it's hard not to give away plot
spoilers in any extended discussion, but I'll try to be as discreet as
I can. I'll only say as much as this: Tokyo is a very funny spoof on a
beloved Japanese film genre (and it's not martial arts movies), one
which often features the city of Tokyo (or the rubble thereof) as a
setting. Considering this was originally intended to be a Chicken-Comp
game, you can probably imagine how it works.  There are several
reasons why Tokyo is fun, not the least of which is the
writing. Random description &quot;events&quot;, while having no effect on the
main storyline, give the chaotic scenes an antic charm, and the
depictions of movie cliches should bring a knowing smile to the face
of any film buff.

One interesting experiment in Tokyo is its use of a split PC. In other
words, the player actually controls the actions of two characters,
both a rather anonymous individual watching a movie and the hero of
that movie.  This is an imaginative idea, and it sometimes works very
well. At its best, Tokyo evokes the kind of split consciousness that
actually happens while watching a movie. We are present, in the
theater, there with the plush seats, the popcorn, and the people
around us. But once we become immersed in the movie, we are inside of
it as well. We forget about the theater and become part of the story,
at least until the baby behind us starts crying, or the teenagers in
the front make a wisecrack. However, the game is not always at its
best. The split focus creates some confusion as to how commands will
be interpreted -- you can never be sure whether your command will be
executed by the viewer or the hero. This generally doesn't cause a
problem, but it might have worked better if the transitions were
smooth and complete, and the only interruptions happened outside of
the player's control. In addition, the standard library has been
mostly unmodified, so that its messages remain mostly in the second
person voice. When that's the voice of the entire game, this is not a
problem, but Tokyo asks second person POV to take on the special duty
of signaling that the viewer, rather than the hero, is
reacting. Consequently, messages like &quot;You can't see any such thing&quot;
(rather than &quot;Our hero can't see any such thing&quot;) can create a little
confusion.

Finally, I can't review Tokyo without mentioning its graphics. No,
it's not a z6 game, but Tokyo has some surprises up its
sleeve. Finding them provides some of the funniest moments of the
game. Tokyo does a great many things well, and is one of the better
short-short games I've played. Again, it's a bit disappointing when a
game this enjoyable ends so soon -- I think this concept had quite a
bit more mileage in it than was used by the author. Still, I enjoyed
it while it lasted -- it won't entertain you as long as the average
summer blockbuster movie, but it will probably entertain you more.

Rating: 7.9

TITLE: Dracula Part I: The First Night

PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Glulx interpreters
AVAILABILITY: freeware; IF Archive

VERSION: Release 6

Occasionally I get the urge to play some gothic horror game, featuring vampires, 
werewolves, and all the other sorts of unnamed horrors that lurk below the 
surface of the night.  Thankfully, Interactive Fiction has its fair share of 
this genre, some excellent, some average, and some just plain awful.  While 
Dracula Part I: The First Night falls between the average and just plain awful 
categories, it does have some redeeming qualities that make it worth playing for 
the 10 minutes it takes to complete.

Dracula Part I: The First Night is a remake of the Rod Pike game Dracula, 
released in 1986 on the Commodore 64.  Actually, it's a remake of the first part 
of Rod Pike's Dracula game.  The authors have promised the second and third 
parts are forthcoming, and I can't imagine what is taking them so long, as this 
first part literally takes less than 45 minutes to see all it has to offer.  
[As of this publication, the second part of the trilogy -- Dracula: The 
Arrival -- has just been released. --ed.]  Throw in the fact that it is a near 
identical game to the original, and I'm left wondering why they didn't just 
remake Pike's original trilogy in full.  The text is ripped directly from the 
original, and although the graphics have been redone, almost everything else is 
the same, aside from some minor additions.  The differences are few, but using 
the Inform parser is by far the greatest improvement.  The original was clunky 
and hard to manipulate, but this version is far easier to handle by comparison.  

The story is of John Harker, who is on his way to meet his "client," no doubt 
Dracula.  Harker has arrived at the Golden Krone Hotel in the Carpathian 
mountains for a brief respite before continuing his journey.  It is told from 
the first person perspective, with the parser constantly demanding the player 
"tell me what to do."  This first person narrative is fairly entertaining, but 
is punctuated by far too many exclamations and instances of bad grammar and a 
few misspelled words.  Seems understandable when you realize that the first 
language of the author is Spanish, but unforgivable when you think about the 
fact that the text is nearly identical to the 1986 version.

The main puzzles hinge on what you have to eat and drink for dinner.  Some are 
more difficult to manage than the others, but all are fairly simplistic.  There 
are some interesting graphics that pop on screen for these interludes, probably 
the most improved aspect from the original aside from the parser.  Depending on 
the puzzle and how you die (if you fail) you get a different picture.  They also 
threw in some familiar music to add ambience at this point, so turn up those 
speakers.

By far the most annoying part of the game is the fact that it makes assumptions 
about what the player knows.  Have you examined everything before you've tried a 
particular course of action?  If not, you may find yourself in a bind at one 
point or another, which will lead to your death or failing to complete the game. 
 It's not a big loss, as you'll always be able to "undo" your last move or just 
play through again since it's so short.  However, it is a tad annoying.

Overall, Dracula Part I: The First Night suffers greatly from its short length 
and questionable prose.  If the game was less remake and more makeover, it would 
work far better and be a much more successful game.  The fact that parts 2 and 3 
are not yet available (excepting the Commodore 64 originals) also puts a damper 
on the enjoyability of this title.  As it stands right now, Dracula: The First 
Night is a below average game that offers almost no real reasons to play through 
it, aside from the pretty graphics, and the fact that you can finish it while 
waiting for your wife to get out of the bathroom.  Once parts 2 and 3 become 
available, it will be well worth it.  Until then, it feels like a text adventure 
from 1986 that needs to be reworked badly.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag44.html">SPAG #44</a> -- April 30, 2006

To be fair from the onset, Dracula the First Night (DTFN) is a remake and a 
translation of an older game, and the initial splash screen captures well the 
spirit of the old EGA graphics while conveying a hint of mystery. Still, this 
screen reads, "Remaked by..." and unfortunately, that signifies what lies in 
store.

Immediately you're given the option of choosing maroon text on black or gold 
text on blue. (Ugh.) The EMPHASIZED WORDS IN ALL CAPS grate the nerves as does 
the chat-like sentence construction...a bunch of short phrases and half-
sentences...arranged like this. Spelling errors are legion; the writing tone is 
utterly bombastic and overwrought; exclamation marks deluge the player! Yes, 
this is the familiar topography of the Penny Dreadful and the 1950's B-movie. 
Was this what the author wanted to achieve? I suspect so.

Most of the puzzles are simple and appropriate, except for one. It's a timed 
puzzle that you'd never know was timed until you lost the game. To solve it, you 
have to do something non-obvious a priori. (Argh.) Some puzzles involve rather 
improbable scenarios, such as waking up carrying everything that you were 
holding before you went to sleep. This detracts from the atmosphere but then 
again, that may have been an intentional nod to, or spoof of the horror genre.

As for mechanics, the parser seemed lacking. Examining anything but an object 
with an Examine routine returns the result for the coded object. There are a few 
doors, but you can't knock on them because the parser doesn't recognize that 
word. The same goes for answer, table, and many others. However, because the 
puzzles are simple, you don't have to play "guess the verb" very often.

DTFN does exploit other features of Glulx, such as full-window graphics and 
music. These graphics are presented after long sections of text as a way of 
visually enhancing the effect. The last graphic presents a well done panorama of 
your destination. The music consists of a simple synth organ which begins when a 
graphic appears and pauses only when a new graphic appears. (Ow.) Though well-
played, the classical MIDI melody oozes cliche`s.

The verdict? I salute the author for creating a game in Glulx. I've tried and 
found the going awfully rough. The game includes random elements that make each 
time through slightly different but not overly so. That's creative. And the 
graphics, though sparse, do effectively enhance the atmosphere. The plot works 
well for a game of this length -- fifty turns once you know the way. However, 
the parser, the writing, the grammar, and the colors prove very trying.

If you are expecting a modern Glulx game, I'm afraid that DTFN isn't it. The 
author isn't a native English speaker but he deserves some credit for his work; 
that's why I give this game a solid 3. If you're a fan of the old-school EGA
games and/or IF with graphic touches, of course, you might enjoy Dracula: The 
First Night much more. An hour or so of retro diversion awaits you.

VERSION: 1.2

Did you know that an interviewer makes something like ten judgments
about you in the first five seconds of an interview? It's probably not
surprising to find that interviewers make judgments on lots of
potentially obvious things like your age, cultural background and
gender. What is surprising, is that they also make judgments on things
like your morals and the income that you made in your previous job.
These assumptions can often lead to one of two things happening (unless
you find an extraordinarily objective interviewer): a halo effect or a
halo error. A halo effect happens when you've made a favorable
impression on an interviewer and he grades your answers in a more
positive light. A halo error is just the opposite and occurs when a poor
impression is made and those same answers are graded on a harsher scale.
Suffice it to say that impressing an employer during an interview has
far less to do with your knowledge than it does with your personal
presentation style, charisma, and luck (no one wants to be interviewed,
let's say, by a person who's wife left him that morning). 

As a result, interviews are one of the worst indicators of future job
performance. Interestingly enough, interviews don't make for
particularly riveting interactive fiction either.

Dragon Resources Stories (DRS) is a spoof on the last place finisher of
the 1998 comp <a href = "h.html#human">Human Resources Stories</a> (HRS), which was essentially a
multiple choice style interview that gave you a grading and salary scale
based on the answers you chose. As interactive fiction, HRS rated
poorly, and that's to be expected. As a simulation of an interview
however, it also rated poorly, because we never get to see any of the
reactions from the interviewer. Interviews are all about two-way
communication and it's just as important for an interviewee to be
knowledgeable and well prepared as it is for her to be astute enough to
read the interviewer's verbal and non-verbal signals, and adjust her own
communication style accordingly.

DRS takes HRS one step further with a very active interviewer that gives
you some verbal and non-verbal feedback after each of your answers,
thereby letting you know if you're on the right track or not. To make
the premise even more interesting, you're an aging dragon looking for
work. The interview contains some direct competency based questions such
as:

   "So, as a dragon, do you use GOTO?"

Some behavioral questions:

   "You're about to eat a virgin when it begs for mercy, promising aid
   from a powerful family member. What do you do?"

And some nonsensical ones:

   "Do you think this feather in my helmet makes me look less
   threatening?"

The interviewer's responses to your answers, although often exaggerated
to implausible extremes, illustrate just how important it is to create
that halo effect. There's everything, from some subtle non-verbal
feedback like the interviewer perking up "slightly but perceptibly", to
full blown rambles about how your answers remind him of how much he
loves his daughter, to the interviewer criticizing you for contradicting
something in your resume. The astute interviewee will pick up quickly on
the interviewer's preferences after playing once or twice and should be
able to achieve an optimal score (an A-rating on both the leadership and
technical scale).

DRS doesn't finish with the interview, however. It smartly takes the job
screening process one step further for those interviewees lucky enough
to make that good first impression.

Your final challenge is a practical test of sorts (incidentally,
practical tests are very good indicators of future job performance),
where you have a finite amount of time to save yourself and the mountain
you stand on from destruction. It's a puzzle that makes you follow
through on one of your answers from the interview and screams out,
"Leave your glossy smile, cheap bravado, and inflated ego at the door.
Let's see what you can do, when it really counts!"

The game at this point breaks away from the multiple choice, decision
tree-style nature of the game and let's the player try a whole host of
dragon-related things to save himself. There are a few possible endings
depending on your actions and each one is implemented well.

Another little bonus in the game is a homage of sorts to the brilliance
behind HRS and the whole decision-tree style of communicating in IF.
It's funny, maybe a little too congratulatory, but in the end correctly
states that, "HRS is no <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a>". 

Other than that, the dialogue is witty and entertaining and particularly
funny for anyone who's been on an interview or ever given one. This game
is a fun 5-minute romp for most of us, and a must play for any career
strategists out there.

Dragonlord is a new point-and-click type game from the creators of a
company called 4830 Games that uses their Win 95/98/NT executable
homegrown text adventure engine as an interface. 

Let me just start off by saying that I think it's very commendable when
an author (or in this case a team of programmers) tries to not only
write a story on his/her own, but also create their own text-adventure
interface. It's one thing to be able to say something interesting when
you already know how to speak the language, but it's another thing
entirely when you have to create the language first before you can
speak. Unfortunately, as with most home-brewed-parser-type games, the
results are mixed, and understandably so; it's very difficult to produce
a gaming language as polished as Inform or Tads (considering both game
engines have been in development for years) on your first try, and that
will always reflect on the overall quality of the game, regardless of
how good or bad the writing, puzzles, storyline, etc. are.

Dragonlord, with its structured style, reminded me a lot of the Fighting
Fantasy choose-your-own-adventure-style books by Steve Jackson and Ian
Livingston in that you have a description of your situation followed by
one or two alternative paths you can follow. So, not surprisingly, it
rates very high in terms of its story but very low on interactivity. In
most cases there are only one or two options you can pursue, and on many
occasions there are the dreaded &lt;&lt;Click here to continue&gt;&gt; transitional
options which the author uses to break up longer paragraphs. Here is a
typical example of the game's structured style:

   Some militaristic interior decorator really went nuts in this area.
   Endless numbers of weapons, indecipherable coats of arms and a great
   big suit of armor standing over in the far corner. The suit of armor
   seems to be clutching a pretty huge, sharp-looking battleaxe. You've
   never used one of these babies before, but you can't help but feel
   that it might come in handy.

CLICKABLE OPTIONS:

   Get axe?

   Head back outside?

I can think of a few other things I might like to do in this situation
including examining the axe, putting on the armor, and trying to
decipher the coat of arms, but such is the nature of a point-and-click
interface. You just don't have much in the way of player freedom. 

Although it's fairly obvious that Dragonlord is very structured in its
layout, it was interesting to find that it wasn't as linear as I had
initially thought. The author allows the player to revisit certain
sections of the game so that missing a special item or important piece
of information the first time around doesn't mean you've rendered the
game unwinnable. It was also surprising to see that there were alternate
solutions to different puzzles that were put together quite creatively. 

The game features a role playing, hit point-style system where you lose
hit points every time you're injured (although damage is based on the
paths you choose and not random injuries that occur throughout the
course of battle), and a button you can press that lists your inventory
items (although you have no ability to manipulate those items once you
get to the screen). There is also a quit button you can press that
brings you to an intro screen, which allows you to restart, load, and
save games.

OK. I've talked enough about the game's engine and interface so let's
move onto Dragonlord as a literary and playing experience. Well to start
off, the plot is pretty much standard adventure fare. You're the chosen
champion who has to defeat the fearsome dragon and while on your way to
the dragon's cave, you must also conquer some obligatory,
unrelated-to-the-ultimate-goal-type hurdles. Unfortunately, this
particular storyline isn't very novel. We all know that the dragon genre
has been beaten to death around here so trying to do something different
with it is much more difficult than it would be with other storylines
that haven't had as much exposure. The "surprise" ending is well
telegraphed in advance so the ending isn't really the shocker that the
author may have intended it to be. The writing isn't world class
(although some of the characters like the contemporary dragon and the
troll have their comical moments), but a plus was that there were few
grammatical and spelling mistakes when I played through it.

There are also a few little rough spots here and there with game logic
and ideas that could have been implemented better. For example, the PC
isn't able to read, but plaques, signs, etc. are written in almost plain
English (almost plain, meaning an extra vowel added here, or a missing
consonant there) so what ends up happening is that the player can
understand the message and act on it, even though the protagonist
technically shouldn't be able to. There are a few instances where there
is death or injury without warning (i.e., entering a relative's home --
which I as a player would have assumed was a safe haven -- resulting in
your relative throwing you out and a loss of hit points because of a
previous argument that the player has no idea about), and furthermore a
few instances that were completely counterintuitive (i.e., approaching
characters you assume are friendly and then getting attacked or moving
in directions that sound dangerous and finding out differently). In
fact, it almost got to the point that when I felt something was
counterintuitive it probably was the correct thing to do, and I was
usually right.

Although Dragonlord's plot isn't necessarily novel (as I've mentioned,
it doesn't really broaden the scope of the fantasy/dragon genre), I
still think it's an excellent piece to get beginners started on.
Whenever I've tried to introduce friends to interactive fiction, they
always seem to get hung up on the parser and its limited vocabulary. So,
lately I've been trying to find good story driven games to start people
off on like <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> and <a href = "m.html#moment">A Moment of Hope</a>. These games require very
little guess-the-verb and fairly simple commands to achieve a result.
Although maybe not as good as the two aforementioned games, I would
definitely include Dragonlord as a game I would recommend for beginners
(especially younger ones, as Dragonlord's theme and storyline aren't
especially deep) as a way to get them used to playing something
text-based.

Overall, Dragonlord is a pretty good first attempt and like I mentioned
earlier, I'm always impressed when someone creates a text adventure game
with their own text game engine. There is an upcoming sequel that has
been promised and I'm looking forward to seeing what game design and
game engine improvements Mr. Silcox and his team have in store.

Version: Release 1 / Serial number 060723 / Inform 7 build 3T38 (I6/v6.31 lib
6/10N)

Dreadwine was the only entry in the first MC Dream mini-comp.  David Cornelson,
who organised the mini-comp, says "the premise of this mini-competition is to
write a game that represents one of your most vivid dreams. The intent is to
convey the emotion you felt that made the dream so remarkable.".  Should
Dreadwine be judged as a game or as a conveyor of the author's emotions?  As a 
game it provides little of interest, few interesting interactions and a 
solution that is arbitrary and unsatisfying.  As a vector for emotion it fares 
rather better.

The central premise is that you have to escape the town in order to escape the 
rather unpleasant fate that appears to inevitably befall the town's occupants.  
Naturally your PC won't let you escape without also rescuing a key NPC.

The dream, which is context that the player is aware of but not the PC, and the 
principal NPC, who is familiar to the PC (apparently) but not the player, are 
both used as devices to restrict movements, actions, and descriptions.  That 
the dream provides an explanation for the abstraction and the surreal 
juxtapositions is nice, but more than that it's very nice that the author 
manages to turn this round and use the abstraction and the situations to 
reinforce the fact that one is playing in a dream.  In a way the dream provides 
a solution to the problem of how to restrict what the PC can do.  You're 
playing a dream, why should you be able to do everything that you can do in the 
real world?  Many objects that would demand a more detailed description in 
another game have abbreviated descriptions appropriate to the dream setting: 
"There are other buildings round about, of course, but you are only vaguely 
aware of them".

The restrictions imposed by the key NPC interfere with the gameplay more, but 
they reinforce the characters of both the PC and the key NPC and are therefore 
crucial in supporting the game's emotional content.  An example that draws on 
both the dream and the key NPC: "No, you don&#8217;t want to go west, for you sense 
that it leads only to darkness and despair. [KEY NPC's NAME] tugs at your 
sleeve, urging you to turn round and go some other way.".  Now, in terms of 
gameplay this is the just the "you can't do that because I haven't implemented 
the entire universe" response, but the immersive spell remains unbroken by the 
way the author has married the reponse to the situation.

The town has a drab sullen atmosphere suffused with a sense of forboding.  The 
author writes very well and manages to create his dream with economical English 
that is interesting and evocative.  I feel like I shouldn't have to say this is 
a review, but the author's writing is error free.  The author, in ABOUT, 
mentions "one literary influence that will be immediately apparent to a great 
many players", well, it wasn't apparent to me, maybe I'm just less well read 
than most game players.

In what to me was a bit of flashback to playing City of Secrets, the town is 
"populated" with randomly generated NPCs that pop up in the various street 
location from time to time.  Here, as in CoS, it does a good job of providing a 
bit of background colour.

This isn't a very big game (half an hour of play would typically be enough), 
and there doesn't appear to be much to do.  I found it a bit of a frustrating 
experience struggling to find what little there is to do, because it's never 
entirely clear when you exhausted a line of investigation.  What is implemented 
is implemented well.  I reached two endings, one is obviously unsatisfying, but 
the other doesn't leave me very satisified either.  Whilst wondering if there 
are more endings I rediscover the ABOUT text which proclaims that there are two 
endings. With the hindsight of having found them both it's now clear that the 
ABOUT text also more or less tells you how to finish the game.  You seem to get 
an extra 10 minutes in bed in one of the endings, so that must be a good thing.

Given that there appears to be little to do it would be nice if more verbs were 
implemented.  If only because frustrated players, like me, are likely to try 
lots of things.

I think Dreadwine is well worth dipping into just for the emotional content.  I 
was left wanting more, partly because the endings have no real resolution and 
partly because Dreadwine make it clear that the author could do it so well.  In 
many ways I think Dreadwine could quite plausibly form the introductory chapter 
of a much larger game, in that sense I was reminded of the opening of Trinity.

AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/dreamhold.z8">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/dreamhold.z8</a>
VERSION: Release 5

The Dreamhold, in my opinion, strikes the mark of a well-done adventure
game. This game is written with people new to the lore of interactive
fiction in mind; in fact, there is a "Tutorial Voice" narrator that
guides you through your endeavors, helping you with the basic concepts
of IF. One thing that distinguishes this game is that all aspects of
this game -- not just the ever-helpful Voice -- seem to be written to
encourage and bring satisfaction to the player. Rather like a parent,
this game guides and directs you. It is not that you are not allowed to
fail, but when you make a mistake, you are gently admonished, then shown
the right way around an obstacle. As I am fairly new to IF, I found this
game both insightful and refreshing. Although I already knew how to
travel and manipulate objects with commands, I was delighted to glimpse
the sage and kind mind of an interactive-fiction master and the art to
which I am an infant.

From my perspective, the story is the weakest point of "The Dreamhold."
That is saying much, for it really is not that bad. At the start of the
game, the motives for the player character are escape, exploration, and
self-discovery. As the game moves forward, the plot becomes much more
interesting. Still, the game does not explain its story as it presents
it to the player, and I was incapable of figuring it out. I knew there
was meaning there, yet at best I could put together a few pieces of
background, which would seem unrelated to each other if it were not for
a common detail or two, the significance of which I could only muse at.
I was especially confused at the ending -- it was definitely an attempt
to tie everything together, but for me it just confused and muddled the
little bit that I thought I had worked out. Still, the story was not a
complete failure -- the scenes of background were so nicely integrated
with the puzzles as to keep me interested in both the narrative and the
crossword. While irritating, it was fun to try to figure out the meaning
of the scenes and the history of the player character. Also, my
difficulties with the story may have been personal; perhaps other people
would find it all to make perfect sense. Maybe the game was not even
written to have a clear meaning at all, in which case with story as with
puzzles "The Dreamhold" succeeded in its goals.

More than making up for the story are the puzzles. Solving the puzzles
is pleasantly rewarding, and new areas to explore and more story to
unfold come as results of your efforts. The game never forgets about its
striving player -- all the puzzles are fair and to my knowledge cannot
be made unwinnable. Most are probably easier from the norm, but figuring
out how objects work can sometimes be a bit complicated, although never
frustratingly so. In addition to the Tutorial Voice, which sometimes
offers help, the game offers a thorough hint system that will not at
first spoil the puzzle you are working on, if it tarnishes the joy of
solving it just a bit. The whole makes "The Dreamhold" very enjoyable.
In fact, I, being introduced to IF after it had taken a turn toward
narrative, was shown by this game the value and excitement of good
puzzles.

The mechanics of the game were excellent to the high standard as a
tutorial that the game sets initially for itself. I do not try every
possible action or close every door behind me just for the sake of
ensuring that it works properly, but I found no bugs in the game. It is
especially mandatory for this game to be bug-free because of its status
as beginner's IF; it was created in such a way that it could actually be
someone's very first game, so imagine the confusion on the part of the
poor newbie when something did not work as explained. Not only is the
game without bugs, but also I recall running into no grammatical errors.
For even those folks who have their playtime experience ruined by minor
slips of grammar, "The Dreamhold" will likely immerse you in its perfect
prose.

As a game in general, "The Dreamhold" raises the bar high, not just as a
tutorial. It builds up the player's trust by never failing to live up to
its high standards, and the result is great. You become the game's
friend and feel it encouraging you in your difficulties and delighting
with you in your triumphs. At any rate, for beginners and advanced
players alike, I recommend anyone the awesome glow of satisfaction that
comes from "The Dreamhold."

  CHARACTERS: Good, but limited               DIFFICULTY: Medium

        Inspired by the history of Level 9 in SPAG 3, I got out my old BBC B
(8 bit British computer, ancestor of the Archimedes and RISC PC), and loaded
Dungeon Adventure. This is a fantasy adventure, set in a similar universe
to the original Adventure, where you play the typical greedy adventurer
in search of treasure. This time, you are looting a demon lord's tower
(after the demon's destruction in Adventure Quest).
        At the beginning there are a few unfair puzzles, such as the example
quoted in the Inform manual of carved lions above a doorway, in front of a
pit (&quot;pride comes before a fall&quot;), but the quality of the puzzles throughout
the rest of the game is excellent. The game is large enough to occupy anyone
for some time.
        Although the characters are not as advanced as those in the better
Infocom games (<A HREF="w.html#witness">Witness</A>, <A HREF="s.html#suspect">Suspect</A>, etc), they are interesting and numerous,
including an argumentative sword, a helpful dwarf, two giants, an unhappy
will-o'-the-wisp and an army of orcs.
        I would recommend this game to anyone with a Spectrum emulator (or
even a Spectrum :), and plenty of time.
        This game was originally available for the 8-bit British computers of
the eighties, such as the BBC and the Spectrum. According to SPAG 3, it is
now available for ftp from ftp.ijs.si in the directory /pub/zx/snapshots/a/
with filename dunadv128k.zip for the graphical version and dunadv48k.zip 
for the plain text. A PC emulator for the Spectrum is in the directory
/pub/zx/snapshots/z/ and called z80-201.zip. (Please don't email me about 
these; I've only used the BBC version and I haven't tried the emulator).

  NAME: The Dungeon of Dunjin             PARSER: Infocom-Like
  AUTHOR: Magnus Olsson                   PLOT: Non-Linear (Treasures)

  CHARACTERS: Few, Simple                 DIFFICULTY: Above-Average 

        The Dungeon of Dunjin is a shareware game which has been available
for several years.  It was written by a Swedish national, Magnus Olsson,
but the game is in English (although you'd never know it wasn't written 
by an American, to tell you the truth).  The original game was written
using Turbo Pascal; it has also been ported to the Macintosh, where it
sports a rather spiffy user interface.  The parser is about as good as the
older Infocom games, not allowing for any complicated structures but
sufficient to get the job done with a minimum of &quot;guess the word&quot; problems.
        The &quot;hook&quot; of the game is simple enough.  You're a tourist of sorts,
here to visit the famous Dungeon of Dunjin, a series of caverns and
adventurous areas known far and wide.  Unfortunately for you, the Dungeon
is closed for renovation (and due to a few nagging problems with visitor
safety).  Of course, like any good adventurer, you won't let this daunt you
-- especially with all the treasures to be had once you get inside. 
        Collection of these treasures is the primary way you will score
&quot;points&quot; in the game; however, I would venture to say that the plot of the
game is only incidentally related to the collection of these items.  In fact,
you will do much more than run around gathering up trinkets; if you are brave
and careful, you'll save a princess from an evil wizard's spell and slay a
terrible dragon, among other things.  In truth, the final scene of the game,
where you present your treasures for counting (in a very Adventure-like
fashion), is really an anticlimax; but don't worry, because the other plot
points have enough text to satisfy and the writing is very solid throughout.
        The first few puzzles are very easy, a deliberate decision on the
author's part so that players can experience quick success which hopefully
will give them enough of a sense of accomplishment not to quit in
frustration when they hit the harder puzzles later on, and I think it is a
very good idea, one which other games should emulate.  The game boasts an
impressive on-line hint facility, which is context-sensitive; it tries to
give you the hint you need, based on your current situation, and is largely
successful.  The hints are only provided up to a certain point in the story,
however, after which you're on your own.  One problem with the game is that
it features not one, but several mazes (although only one of them is
strictly required to finish the game).  Luckily, they are small mazes, and
easily mapped; but many players will still cringe in horror at the
repetition.  At the time of this writing, the author is working on a new
version which will feature a way to bypass the mazes without tedium or
severe penalty, as well as increasing the strength of the parser to include
more conversation with NPCs.
        The game as a whole is very enjoyable.  You'll quickly discover that
the &quot;Dungeon&quot; is not merely a series of dank chambers beneath the surface,
but rather a very large and vast world containing everything from dragons to
dwarves and even computer hackers (I hope you can handle it).  One very
interesting idea in the game is that magic works within the &quot;fantastic&quot;  
regions, inside the dungeon, but not in the &quot;mundane&quot; regions, and objects
behave accordingly depending on where you are.  The writing is good, and
there is a fair amount of humor in the game -- some of it, especially the
part involving ABBA, is not to be missed.  Upon finishing the game, I was
very satisfied, because it is challenging.  
        Although I say the plot is &quot;non-linear&quot; because you are able to solve
many of the puzzles in no particular order, the truth is that once you
discover the true plot of the game, certain actions will be imposed on you
and it is possible to get into a bind where you are trapped with no recourse
but to restore a saved game.  This is unlikely, however, and should not
happen unless you are playing through the game a second time and really get
ahead of yourself. 
        A possible point of contention for some people might be the
registration fee -- $20, which is generally considered &quot;a lot&quot; for a
shareware text adventure game.  I would say that it's worth the money, as
long as you don't run screaming in terror from mazes.  Give it a look and see
for yourself; I think you'll find The Dungeon of Dunjin an enjoyable
experience.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag14.html">SPAG #14</a> -- May 17, 1998

The documentation for Magnus Olsson's Dungeons of Dunjin candidly
admits it isn't up to the Infocom standard of quality, and it's right,
as far as that goes--it's not. But, to judge it fairly, it was written
at a time--1992--before any free-or shareware games had come close to
that standard; moreover, it was written in Pascal, and the parser was
put together from the ground up, as it were. And when judged in its
proper context, it's quite a solid game, with some clever puzzles and
some humor to help the proceedings along.

The plot, oddly, is perhaps the weakest part; authorship system
limitations don't limit a game's story as such, and yet Dunjin feels
like it doesn't know what it wants to be. You're set down outside a
cave and sent off to explore without much of a sense of what you're
doing--the documentation doesn't provide much guidance--other than a
sign nearby advising that you're to bring treasures to the Adventure
Office. Shades, naturally, of <a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a>, but that game was content
to be a treasure hunt. This one tries to throw in another plot;
trouble is, you don't really know what it is (though you get a few
hints) until more than two-thirds of the way through, and it hardly
makes sense of what's come before.

For example, one key object is hidden in a place where no one could
get to it without some fairly drastic measures--who put it there?
where was it before? Similarly, you accumulate clues about a certain
crystal you have to use long before you have any idea what the crystal
is, or why you would need it; that comes at the end of the game. The
scoring system makes the extra plot central and the treasures
extraneous--the treasures are bonus points at the end of the game,
essentially--but it's hard to say that you pursue any particular goal
through the bulk of the game.

Disregarding that flaw, though--and it's hardly unique to this
game--Dunjin does manage to be quite entertaining. There are several
very clever puzzles that involve magic, and others that involve
defeating magic in novel ways. One distract-the-guardian puzzle
recalls <a href = "t.html#trinity">Trinity</a>, and the premise is much funnier (and appropriate for
the author's Swedish origins). There and at other times, the author
sends up the adventure-quest genre in entertaining ways--notably, in
your interactions with a genie, in figuring out a certain &quot;magic
word,&quot; and in your discovery of old beer cans in an unlikely place.

The conflation of locales that was occasionally distracting in
Colossal Cave works better here because it's in the interests of
humor: that a crucial bit of information is written on a candy
wrapper, and that a key clue involves a Beatles song, provides an
element of silliness that feels just right, somehow. In that the plot,
when you discover it, is fairly standard save-the-princess and
get-the-fabled-object stuff, Dunjin feels more like a conventional
treasure-hunt than a parody as a whole, but there are more than enough
funny or offbeat moments to keep the player involved. (My personal
favorite--when you've disposed of a guard dog, the game chimes in to
let you know that the dog didn't actually suffer a nasty fate. A sort
of &quot;no animals were harmed&quot; touch.)

It would take some remarkable writing to make Dunjin feel like a truly
coherent game environment, with computer labs and dragons and
conventional houses and dwarves' mines virtually side by side, and
accordingly Dunjin's writing is best described as competent; virtually
all locations have a few compact sentences conveying the scene. (The
computer lab, with a full screen of text, is the exception--one
wonders whether it was modeled on something in the author's own
experience, given the excess of detail.)  There are mini-settings that
are well done--a coal mine in particular, and some scenes, such as
your view of a valley, are arrestingly described--though others, such
as a series of tunnels, could stand some more detail. A big sprawling
treasure-hunt like this should convey the relevant details as clearly
as possible, though, rather than striving for atmosphere at every
turn, and Dunjin does that quite well at virtually every turn.

Getting through Dunjin is a project. There are many distinct areas of
the game to discover, each with at least 15 rooms to discover and make
sense of, and often solutions involve objects found in obscure places,
far away from the relevant puzzle. The end in particular requires
either lots of foresight about the proper objects or some major
traipsing around--there are some shortcuts provided, but one of them
closes off at a certain moment. None of the puzzles are
extraordinarily hard, and none that I recall require knowledge
obtained by death, but the sheer size and scope of the game make
everything feel a little daunting. Dunjin does strike a nice balance
between linearity and breadth--the various sections of the game that
you discover give you enough of a choice that you have several
different puzzles to work on, but they're not quite big enough to make
the whole thing feel aimless. But there are a few slightly unfair
moments as well where the game closes off with little warning; saving
often is vital.  (And, of course, there are mazes--four, by my count,
none huge but three big enough to require mapping with objects.) All
of the puzzles are logical, though; none bend the rules of the
universe, even the fantasy universe, too much, and the small
illogicalities here and there (a gate that you can close and then walk
through, a key hidden in a somewhat absurd place) don't detract much
from the game.

As noted, the game was written in Pascal, and the system performs
admirably. There are a few disambiguation problems--the game has a few
too many books and pieces of paper, and getting them all in one place
is occasionally not a good idea--but very few and none fatal to
interacting with an object. The 1998 player may miss &quot;undo&quot; and such,
and there was no &quot;script&quot; command that I could find, but the parser
does handle a fairly wide variety of verbs and recognize pronouns as
well. (Wow.) There are some complicated code tasks--timed and
landscape-changing events--that go off without a hitch, and the few
moments that require exact syntax weren't sufficiently clumsy to slow
me down for long. Though it's nothing special, I appreciated the game
not kicking me right out to the DOS prompt when I died or otherwise
ended the game--it's the sort of user-friendly thing (especially in
Windows) that can make a difference in overall enjoyment.  The only
real problem I encountered is that the rooms don't have names as such,
and traveling through them a second time yields &quot;You're in corridor&quot;
and such, often not sufficiently descriptive to remind me of where I
was (particularly in a game this size); I had to switch the thing into
VERBOSE to make sense of the game environment. But that's hardly a
major drawback, and when compared to its AGT contemporaries, the
gameplay in Dunjin holds up quite well.

On the whole, then, this is a diverting (and lengthy) romp through a
rather diverse dungeon; it deals a bit too heavily in fantasy
conventions, particularly toward the end, to appeal to the player who
genuinely dislikes fantasy, but for those who enjoy the genre and like
seeing it sent up in some fairly clever ways, Dunjin is worth checking
out.

I never finished either of the Douglas Adams Infocom games, because the
same zany humor that made the text so much fun also meant that the
puzzles were more or less incomprehensible to me. If you leave out the
complete disconnection between cause and effect, though, the Douglas
Adams approach lends itself nicely to IF: many of the best bits of
<a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhikers' Guide</a> are descriptions of some strange culture, practice,
or creature. IF's emphasis on setting means that there's plenty of room
in the average game for amusing satirical descriptions, without it even
feeling like a digression.

Harry Hol's "Dutch Dapper IV" takes this idea and runs with it. You're
hero of sorts, though how and why you got into the business was never
entirely explained; you just woke up one morning and found yourself with
a mysterious transporter machine. It proceeds along those general lines.
Hol's humor isn't as sharp as Adams', so inviting the comparison is
possibly dangerous; in particular, some of the things he chooses to
satirize are all-too-easy targets, like the fast food restaurant. It
doesn't take great originality to mock McDonalds and its ilk.

All the same, there were lines that made me smile. And the game has a
generally light-hearted tone, doesn't take itself too seriously, and
gives the impression that the author was having a good time. It's hard
for me to really dislike a game like that. In fact, I'd say the
generally good-natured approach made the game more fun to inhabit than
the sometimes-caustic Adams worlds.

Unlike <a href = "b.html#bureau">Bureaucracy</a> or HHGG, Dutch Dapper IV relies on some fairly
straightforward puzzles, mostly of the kind where you need to get item x
in order to appease person y in order to get into place z. Only one of
them caused me any great confusion, and that was largely because I had
used the wrong verb and assumed that an action was pointless when, in
fact, I was just going about it wrong. On the other hand, there was one
puzzle whose solution particularly pleased me, because it fit so well
into the humorous logic of the game world.

As for plot, there is one, but it doesn't take front stage for most of
the game. The majority of the puzzles take place in a plot vacuum, while
the player wanders around and tries to figure out what's going on; then
you hit a stage where things take off, and suddenly you're accumulating
bunches of points every time you turn around, and reading through a lot
of plot exposition without doing very much. By this time the game had
earned my goodwill, so I didn't really mind, but it does give a bit of
an unbalanced feel to the whole experience.

The game could also stand to be a bit more polished. There are quite a
few points where the game should, logically, assume an action, but it
makes you do it by hand. The inventory limit is apparently just there to
drive one nuts. There are some synonyms that aren't implemented. (In
particular, any hyphenated term should be typed exactly as in the game.)
But again, I found myself willing to forgive this, because I was having
enough fun to make it worthwhile. I encountered no actual bugs, which
was nice.

On the whole, I found "Dutch Dapper IV" a pleasant and entertaining way
to spend an hour and a half. Once you're done, you can play with the
long Amusing list, and read synopses of the first three Dutch Dapper
adventures, in case you missed them. (Since they are either in Dutch or
nonexistent, it's pretty likely that you did.)
