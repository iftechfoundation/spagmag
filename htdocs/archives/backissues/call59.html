<p align="center"><b>Call for Submissions for SPAG Issue #59 (Deadline: November 14, 2010)</b></p>Hi, folks...<br>


<br>


Astute SPAG followers will have noticed that there should have been an
issue around, oh, last month sometime, but it never appeared. My
apologies for that. We're going to try to get things back in track with
a big Competition feature issue for mid-November.<br>





<br>


I say "we" because there are some changes afoot in SPAG's worldwide
headquarters. I'm going to be stepping down as editor following this
issue, passing the torch that was passed to me five years ago to one of
my best and most thoughtful regular contributors: David Monath. You may
not know David as well as you do me, but that will change soon enough.
I'm sure he's going to do a great job, and look forward to seeing how
SPAG evolves under his guidance. David and I will be working on this
next issue together as we make the transition.<br>





<br>


With that said, we need content!<br>


<br>


We'd like to assemble a team of reviewers again this year to tackle the
upcoming Competition entries. If you can help David and me out, please
email me at <a href="mailto:maher@filfre.net" target="_blank">maher@filfre.net</a> and/or David at <a href="mailto:dmonath@gmail.com" target="_blank">davidm.spag@gmail.com</a>, and tell us how many games you might be able to handle.<br>





<br>


There are also some other, already extant games that need reviews. To wit:<br>


<br>


Hoist Sail for the Heliopause and Home<br>


EGC Paper Chase<br>


The Art of Fugue<br>


'Mid the Sagebrush and the Cactus<br>


Digital: A Love Story<br>


Choice of... games (any, some, or all)<br>


<br>


And of course article and interview ideas and submissions, as well as
reviews of older games and games I've overlooked here, are welcome and
encouraged. If you have the time, please think about helping to make my
last issue and David's first a special one!<br>





<br>


Best,<br>


Jimmy
