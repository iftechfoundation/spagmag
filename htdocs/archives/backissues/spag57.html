<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Appropriately enough
in light of the ongoing <a href="http://jayisgames.com/cgdc7/">Jay
Is Games Casual IF Competition</a>, I recently read the new book
from Jesper Juul, <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11844">A
Casual Revolution</a></span><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11844">.</a>
Subtitled "Reinventing Video Games and Their Players," Juul's book
argues that the meteoric rise in popularity in the last five years of
sites such as <a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/">Big
Fish Games</a>, <a href="http://www.sandlotgames.com">Sandlot
Games</a>, and, yes, <a href="http://jayisgames.com/">Jay
Is Games</a>, as well as the appearance of more socially-oriented
console games such as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Guitar
Hero</span> series,&nbsp;represent a sea change in the
way that videogames are perceived by mainstream culture. This is, in
short, the moment when videogames come out of the smelly basements of
the hardcore and take their place alongside music and television as
normal, everyday entertainments.<br>
<br>
Although I certainly don't agree with <a href="http://www.jesperjuul.net/text/clash_between_game_and_narrative.html">everything
he's written over the years</a>, Juul is always a thoughtful,
careful scholar, and he makes a pretty good argument for his case here,
even if said case struck me as more of a summing up of the developing
conventional wisdom about casual gaming than a bold new thesis. His
historical argument is that videogames spent their first several
decades not only growing in complexity and artistry, but also growing
more and more alienating to those who were not already aware of their
conventions, and who lacked the time or motivation to learn said
conventions; in other words, the vast majority of the general
population. He points to articles that followed <span style="font-style: italic;">Pac-Man</span>'s 1981
debut, for instance, that already found it "surprising" how much that
game, unlike most, appealed to women and non-arcade rats. My biggest
a-ha moment came early in the book, when Juul states that instead of
trying to make their games appealing and accessible to a broader range
of players, videogame makers kept chasing after the already converted,
whom they courted through better and better graphics. The Nintendo Wii, he
notes, is by far the least impressive graphically and technologically
of the three big players of the current console generation, yet it has been
not only the most commercially successful but also the most
zeitgeist-changing.<br>
<br>
It's a compelling argument, although I wish Juul had taken it further
to add a bit more heft to this rather slight (and slightly repetitive)
book. It seems to me that many of the classics of the 1980's and early
1990's, games like <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/archon-the-light-and-the-dark"><span style="font-style: italic;">Archon</span></a>, <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/defender-of-the-crown"><span style="font-style: italic;">Defender of the Crown</span></a>,
and <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/fools-errand"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fool's Errand</span></a>,
were casual games in form if not in label, being playable in short
bursts and having that elusive "easy to learn, hard to master" quality
of play. I would have liked to see Juul position the current casual
game scene more solidly as a reaction to the dismaying straitening of
hardcore videogames into a handful of genres and a handful of juvenile,
un-subtle, and always depressingly ultra-violent storylines. But then
again, casual games have their fair share of soulless matching tile and
hidden object clones, and seem as terrified to venture away from their
cute and perky fictions as mainstream games are from their adolescent
power fantasies. Perhaps Juul did not want to cast too many stones
inside that particular glass house.<br>
<br>
But how, you may be asking, does all of this apply to IF? Well, that's
exactly the question I was asking myself as I read, for with IF's
recent exposure on Jay Is Games many have begun to ask whether it might
find a place with the communities of casual players, communities that
certainly dwarf our own in numbers. I'm also prompted to write on this
subject by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/browse_thread/thread/bc312eb3abea7c37#">an
unfortunately dismissive comment</a> I made recently on
rec.arts.int-fiction, a comment that I believe had some truth to it but
that is certainly deserving of further qualification. Juul presents five
qualities which he believes to be intrinsic to the current casual game
phenomenon. I thought it might be useful to ask how IF matches with
each of these qualities.<br>
<br>
Casual games are possessed of positive fictions that often take place in
(a cartoon-ized version of) the everyday world; a bakery or a golf
course, for instance. Hardcore games, on the other hand, are possessed
of dark, "epic" stories generally involving orcs, space marines,
vampires, or some combination thereof. And IF is all over the map here.
We have our share of lighthearted games, but we also have our share of
orcs, space marines, and vampires. More excitingly, we also have games
that fit into none of these categories, games with the sort of literary
and thematic depth that both mainstream and casual games shy away from.
So, then, a subset of IF fits the model of of casual gaming fiction,
but much does not. I would hate to see us lose that portion which does
not in some quest to satisfy the Jay Is Games audience. (Not that I
think this is happening or likely to happen.)<br>
<br>
Casual games are possessed of simple, straightforward interfaces that
make them easy to pick up and play with minimal or nonexistent
instruction. Hardcore games present a bewildering array of controls.
Like most of the general population, these pretty much stop me at the
gate any time I try to play a modern FPS or RTS game; I simply can't be
bothered. And what of IF? Well, this&nbsp;subject has provoked
endless theorizing over the last three decades. On the one hand, IF's
interface is conceptually ridiculously simple: type what you
want to do next. In practice, though, we all know that things are not
so straightforward in even the most polished effort. Can we find a way
to introduce our players to IF conventions without asking that they
read a lengthy ABOUT text? I don't know, but I don't think anyone has
quite gotten there yet. As long as the status quo persists, this will
remain a huge barrier to acceptance with casual gamers. Even the idea
of a tutorial game that we ask everyone to play first would seem
problematic, for that throws us back to the hardcore model of expecting
that our players be familiar with the conventions of our genre before
they play <span style="font-style: italic;">our </span>game.
It's not that those conventions are so terribly complicated; indeed, I
believe their complexity is often overstated in discussions within the
community. Certainly the interface complexity of a <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="./spag54.html#lacuna"><span style="font-style: italic;">Blue Lacuna</span></a>
</span>is nothing in comparison with a hardcore favorite like <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/mass-effect-2"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mass Effect 2</span></a>.
(Thematic complexity is of course another kettle of fish entirely.)
It's rather that the player has to be motivated to spend an hour or so
learning those conventions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Casual game are easily interruptible, load quickly, multitask
politely&nbsp;on the desktop with other applications, can be paused
and saved at virtually any point, and are amenable to being played for
either a few minutes on a coffee break or for hours at a time. IF games
possess these qualities as well, so no worries here. Hardcore games,
meanwhile, relentlessly expand in size and complexity from year to
year, sufficient to always make getting into and out of them as
difficult and time-consuming on our modern multi-gigahertz machines as
it was on my old Amiga 500.<br>
<br>
Casual games minimize frustration, choosing to reward success rather
than punish failure. Hardcore games, with their limited save points and
brick wall difficulty curves, often do the opposite. As Juul is careful
to point out, this does not mean that casual games are always <span style="font-style: italic;">easy</span>. As someone
who once spent a substantial portion of his free time (not to
mention&nbsp;time wherein I <span style="font-style: italic;">should
</span>have been productive) trying to beat the final level of <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/zuma-deluxe"><span style="font-style: italic;">Zuma</span></a>, I
can certainly attest to this.
Indeed, in his interviews with casual players Juul somewhat
surprisingly found that more are likely to quit playing a game because
it is too easy than because it is too hard. Casual games do, however,
give their players a fighting chance, introducing complexity and
ramping up the difficulty only gradually. And, perhaps more
importantly,&nbsp;they minimize the tedium; once a player has
completed that difficult level, for instance, she will never have to
play it again unless she wants to. Once upon a time, IF epitomized the
hardcore gaming ethic, being littered with difficult, often illogical
puzzles, not to mention endless battles with the parser and the
geography. Every player who remembers the supposed "golden age" of the
1980's can tell stories of playing for days and days, reaching the
end... and finding she forgot to do something back on the fifth turn,
making the game unwinnable. There are still too many games like that
today, of course, but the second approach that Victor Gijsbers <a href="./spag56.html#king">described in SPAG's last issue</a>
is quickly becoming conventional wisdom for many of us. It's not only
an approach that aligns us more squarely with the casual gaming model,
but it's also an approach that I believe is simply essential if IF is
to grow as a form of gaming and/or a form of literature. Viva la
revolution.<br>
<br>
Finally, like the best hardcore games a good casual game has the
quality of <a href="http://emshort.wordpress.com/2008/05/24/make-it-juicy/">"juiciness,"</a>
meaning that virtually every action the player takes is rewarded with
interesting, appropriate feedback. Again, one could never describe IF
of the golden age as juicy, but we're getting better all the time. Just
providing descriptions for all scenery objects is a big step, a step
that Inform 7 in particular seems to have greatly encouraged, as even
untested, substandard games written in that language often describe
their worlds in relatively complete fashions. Context-specific failure
messages in lieu of such generic text adventure yawners as "Violence
isn't the answer to this one" is another big step, one that fewer take
but most of the best games do. Through such error messages we as
authors can actually teach the player about his character and the
storyworld in a natural, non-frustrating way. Moving forward, I would
like to see more flexibility in accepting alternate ways of
accomplishing things. If the player tries something reasonable to his
character and his situation, it should either work or give him an
interesting, plausible reason why it doesn't. This means that if I am
carrying an ax with me I should not have to solve a sliding blocks
puzzle to open the door in front of me. Or, if I do, the door better be
made from steel. And whatever you do, don't tell me that "Violence
isn't the answer to this one."<br>
<br>
So, then, the best of modern IF conforms quite well to qualities three
through five. Some but by no means all conforms to quality one, and
quality two remains problematic. And what do I think of all this? Well, I
think that IF shares many qualities with casual games, perhaps even
more than it does with hardcore games, but it also remains in many
respects more demanding of its player than the typical casual effort.
This is not entirely a bad thing. Still, we should continue to strive
to get even better at qualities three through five, for I believe these
to be unambiguous positives. We should continue to experiment with new
ways of introducing IF conventions to newcomers, in the hope of finally
stumbling upon something that truly <span style="font-style: italic;">works</span>. And we
should welcome any casual gaming fans that embrace IF, but we should
not lose our soul in the process. I firmly believe that IF as a form
has the potential to say more than <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/cake-mania"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cake Mania</span></a>;
we should&nbsp;celebrate that potential. Perhaps we can even
convince the Jay Is Games folks to give more substantial IF a try after
we lure them in with these one-room "escape" games. Regardless,
and&nbsp;while we should pursue the casual gamers where
appropriate, we should also keep looking for ways to reach another
important group who might appreciate what we have to offer even more:
readers.&nbsp;<br>

</span></span></span>Casual
gaming site Jay Is Games is running a competition for one-room or at
least snack-sized IF with a theme of "Escape!" It's attracted no fewer
than 30 entries, including some big community names as well as plenty
of newcomers. All are available now for download or browser-based play.
You can also comment and share entries directly from the website.
(Other competition organizers may want to take note...) This is a very
important development in the ongoing quest to gain some more exposure
for IF outside of, well, places like this. SPAG's next issue will
feature reviews of all 30 games.<br>

One Room Game Comp 2010</span></span><br>
Franceso
Cordella is running another One Room Game Comp for games that consist
of, you guessed it, just a single location. Entries in English,
Italian, or any other language are welcome. The deadline for submitting
for games is March 6, 2010 -- perhaps not enough time to develop
something from scratch, but if you have anything in the oven that might
suit...<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Spring Thing 2010</span><br>
And
Greg Boettcher is running another Spring Thing this year, primarily for
(polar opposite alert) longer works of IF of the sort that don't really
fit well into the other, more snack-sized competitions. Send him your
intent to enter by March 1, and your finished game by March 31. And
Greg could always use some help with prize donations.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Post-Comp Comp</span><br>
Every
year there are plenty of promising games to be found in the big annual
Comp that are damaged by bugs, a questionable design choice or two, or
their authors simply running out of time. Sarah Morayati is running a
new Comp for some of those games -- as well as some that many of us
thought were pretty nifty just as they were -- to have a second
go-round. You have until February 28 to replay and re-judge <span style="font-style: italic;">The Believable Adventures of an
Invisible Man</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Byzantine
Perspective</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rover's
Day Out</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yon Astounding
Castle! of some sort</span>.
Rank them -- in order of most improved, not absolute quality -- from
first to fifth and send your votes to Sarah at sarahcryst SP@G

to participate.<br>

PAX East: Intrepid Journalist Needed!</span></span><br class="">
<hr class="" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">As
many of you know already, IF will have a significant presence at the
upcoming <a href="http://www.paxeast.com">PAX East</a>
gaming convention to be held March 26 through March 28 in Boston. Jason
Scott will be premiering his long in-progress and much anticipated
documentary on IF, <a href="http://www.getlamp.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Get Lamp</span></a>,
and J. Robinson Wheeler, Robb Sherwin, Aaron Reed, Emily Short, and
Andrew Plotkin will be participating in a panel discussion on
"Storytelling in the World of Interactive Fiction." Also, Andrew
Plotkin has arranged for a "People's Republic of Interactive Fiction
Hospitality Suite" at the Back Bay Hilton, wherein will take place some
more informal panel discussions as well as plenty of opportunity for
socializing and evangelizing to curious newcomers. All told, it could
add up to the most significant mainstream gaming exposure IF has
received since the early 1990's. I'd love to be there myself, and I'd
love to cover it in SPAG. Unfortunately, I can't do either, due to
having expatriated myself to Denmark last year. That's why I need you.<br>
<br>
If you are going to PAX East, and would be willing to write about the
experience for SPAG, please contact me. While you certainly don't have
to limit your activities at the convention to only those that are
IF-related, I would like firsthand reports from the big panel
discussion and the film premiere, as well as a general slice of the
life in the suite. Some photographs would be wonderful as well. So,
aspiring IF photojournalists, here is your opportunity. You would be
doing a wonderful service to SPAG and to IF in documenting this
important -- nay, historic -- coming out party.<br>

<span lang="RU">I actually
started to really learn English because of a videogame. Although it's
true that I&#8217;ve had had English in school from 3</span><sup><span style="font-size: 7.5pt;" lang="RU">rd</span></sup><span lang="RU">
grade or so, it never really sparked my interest; it was all about
grammar,
vocabulary, and stories of Bob and his cat which was stuck up the tree,
at
which point&nbsp; he _____(have) to get it down. Then, my parents
got their first PC. Sad but true, I didn&#8217;t play my first IF from tape
or on a
college mainframe; I was born in the 80s. Our computer was a 386, and
it ran
Windows 3.1. A colleague of my father gave him some floppies: mostly
office
software, some games. One of the the latter
was <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/space-quest-ii-chapter-ii-vohauls-revenge"><span style="font-style: italic;">Space Quest II</span></a>,
an early Sierra game featuring graphics but still heavily
text-based.&nbsp; Only when I replayed it years later did I see the
humor, the
whole wackiness of the situation, the silliness and references.
Eleven-year-old
me saw a very scary sci-fi adventure tale of a wondrous new planet,
ugly
monsters, life and death. I was intrigued; I was thrilled. Scared
witless, I
played for hours on end. Speaking of
witless, the game was, of course, in English, which&nbsp; explains <i style="">why</i>&nbsp;I didn&#8217;t get the&nbsp;
humor,
couldn&#8217;t get many things to work, and was generally pretty clueless.
(The point
where I was stuck the longest was a maze, though.&nbsp; Grrr,
mazes.) </span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">My interest in
the English language was rekindled in high school.&nbsp;I chose
English as an <i style="">Abiturfach </i>(something
resembling an
A-level course.)<br>
To help with my
skills, a friend gave me some books, mostly Pratchett, in English, and
so my
journey began. DVD's started to become big, and another friend and I
started
watching the English language tracks to improve our ear for the
language (and
also as a weak excuse to keep ourselves from doing some <i style="">real</i>
studying.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">Then one day, I
was unenthusiastically browsing a German Cthulhu forum where they
talked about
Mythos-based games. One of the games linked to was Michael
Gentry's&nbsp;<a href="../a.html#anchor"><span style="font-style: italic;">Anchorhead</span></a>.
I was intrigued;
I was thrilled. As with <span style="font-style: italic;">Space
Ques</span>t, I had my Oxford Advanced Learners on my
lap at all times. I was hooked on
IF. I fondly remember having a crack at cave crawls, puzzlefests,
Speed-IF's,
quite amazing at the effort and talent that went into so many games.
The
broadness of perspectives, the cleverness of the writing, humor that
works,
overrated established authors. How couldn't I be? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">However, playing
these games have showed me the limits of my grasp of English quite
painfully.
In books or movies, you can skip words or phrases you don&#8217;t understand.
In IF,
it is, of course, never that easy. Something you don&#8217;t quite get might
contain
a hint you need. A message you brush off as atmospheric might be
important, and
of course, the whole mood of a piece might be important to
understanding it. This has the
very odd effect that sometimes games which are written in plain, simple
English
are easier to understand for me than the better-written ones. For
instance, I
didn't really understand <i style=""><a href="./spag56.html#broken">Broken Legs</a> </i>because
the writing is <i style="">too good. </i>The
innovative descriptions, the whole subtlety and ambiguity of is
amazing. And
way over my head.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">Eventually I
reached the point where I wanted to write a game myself.&nbsp;At
the time,
Inform 7 had just gone public beta, and as I had virtually no
programming
background, the natural language aspect intrigued me, and I stuck with
it.
I&nbsp; decided to participate in the 2006 IntroComp with a game
called&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Jack
in the Box</span> (a conscious wordplay, in case you're
wondering; it's about a man
called Jack who enters a magic box, not they toy or the food chain). I
hope that one
day enough time will have passed&nbsp; so&nbsp; I can say,
&#8220;Well, I was
young...&#8221; Boy, what a mess this game is. Among the faults
my game has (just from being a first game), there are some language
issues that
make me cringe today. Spelling, grammar, it all is an utter mess.
Misuse of
similes, misplaced words,&nbsp; missing synonyms. (The quote that
began&nbsp;this article is
from a letter in the game.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">While you might
argue that you don&#8217;t need to write in a second language to mess up a
game this
badly, one interesting error is the use of &#8220;headlight&#8221; instead of
&#8220;skylight.&#8221; This is no
oversight &#8211; I didn't look up the wrong word or anything. I was
convinced a
headlight is a small window, high on a wall. (Maybe because it's
overhead?) And
didn't bother to check. Did I mention <span style="font-style: italic;">Jack in the Box</span> had
next to no beta-testing? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">Language
errors&nbsp; are blaringly obvious, but once you get past the
beginner's
struggles, there are other more subtle problems. Call them cultural.
These
especially apply to games which are set in the US, but even a game set
in a
generic contemporary city or country&nbsp; may suffer
problems.&nbsp; Do you
use the metric system, or imperial units? What kind of money? Do you
mention
supermarket chains, or more generally, brand names? (I don't mean
product
placement such as easily recognizable things like Kleenex.) Do you try
to
emulate an accent or dialect? My giddy aunt, that can be a tough one,
me old
china. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">Let's say you see
those problems and decide to write a classic cave crawl instead. You
still have atmosphere to worry about. For example, suppose there is a
pond. You
might give its size (converting the metric to imperial units), but that
is not
very evocative. You want to say it's &#8220;tr&#252;b&#8221;. Off you go looking for the
English
word. <a href="http://dict.leo.org/?lang=en">A&nbsp;German-English
online dictionary</a> gives &#8220;caliginous
/ cheerless / cloudy / dingy / dreary / dull / hazy / mirthless / muddy
/
turbid(ly) / unclear.&#8221; It can be complicated enough to find the word
that's
technically right; To find the one that conveys the mood&nbsp;
you're aiming
for... that's often a tough one. (I would've gone for murky, by the
way.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">Finally, if you
use Inform 7 as a programming tool, we come full circle to the problem
of
understanding. The IDE uses phrases very similar to natural language,
and easy
ones at that, so no problems there. The&nbsp;problem
is understanding the manual.&nbsp; First, there is the language
barrier, then
there is the technical aspect. I did very little programming before I
joined
the IF community, and I often find it hard to understand the manual.
This can make
writing in a second language quite the chore for non-natives. You have
to
translate the manual in your head, then understand it, apply it, code,
find
decent (or at least understandable) text for your
descriptions,&nbsp;and then
hope you didn't accidentally or unknowingly fall&nbsp; for any of
the trappings
mentioned above.&nbsp;Maybe this is
different for other programming languages that don't depend on natural
language so much. A complaint often aimed at Inform 7 is that people
think it
understands more than it does- come to think of it, that may be a
problem for
native speakers, too. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">In conclusion,
the above may make the endeavor seem pretty wearisome (taxing?
strenuous? a
handful?). Yes, yes it is, like carving something out of stone with a
chisel
two sizes too small. Why do it? Why not be content with playing English
games
or writing games in my mother tongue?<br>
Technicalities
aside (Inform 7 is very easy to learn, as opposed to most German
languages
until recently), I blame the Internet. I like the thought that people
all over
the world will play your games and maybe even enjoy them.&nbsp;My
last game had
testers from Finland to Cambodia. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span lang="RU">What it really
boils down to is this: if you're reading this, I'm sure you're well
aware of
how immersive Interactive Fiction can be (much more so than most static
fiction) and all of its thrills, how much fun it is to discuss, the
triumph of
finally being able to code that car chase or releasing a game, the
anticipation
of new transcripts or reviews, the glorious wreckage of your brain as
you think
up inspired XYZZY responses, or why&nbsp; &#8220;&gt;JUMP&#8221; works
while the PC is
hanging from a cliff. I wouldn't want to miss it for the world, and on
top of
this, hey, I learn some more English.</span></p>

with the Top Finishers of IF Comp 2009</span>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">As usual at this
time of year, I am proud to present interviews with the authors of the
top three games from the recently concluded IF Competition. Thanks go
to all of them for taking the time answer my questions so thoughtfully.<br>
<a name="eve"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Eric Eve, Author of <a href="./spag56.html#snowquest"><span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span></a></span><br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: As a perennial top
finisher in the Comp, you're no stranger to regular SPAG
readers at this point. I understand, though, that you've been elected
to the
office of "Assessor" at Oxford for the upcoming academic year.
Perhaps you could explain to those of us not versed in the vagaries of
the
English university system exactly what that means...</span><br>
<br>
Eric: So far as I know the office of Assessor is unique to Oxford
University. Each year three &#8216;ordinary&#8217; academics are elected by
their respective colleges to the offices of Senior Proctor, Junior
Proctor and
Assessor (each college taking their turn on a prearranged rota). The
office of
Proctor dates back to the thirteenth century, but that of Assessor is
somewhat
more recent, having evolved out of a role first created in 1960.
Collectively
the Proctors and Assessor act as representatives of Congregation (the
body of
all teaching members of the University, who in Oxford have ultimate
sovereignty
over the university) to keep watch on the administration (largely by
attending
dozens of University committee meetings, by membership of the
University
Council, and through regular meetings with the Vice-Chancellor). The
Proctors
also have a number of ceremonial functions (particularly at degree
ceremonies)
and a responsibility for student discipline and the conduct of
university examinations,
while the Assessor has particular responsibility for student welfare
and
funding.&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal">While acting in their official
capacity the Proctors and
Assessor are distinguished by wearing a dark suit with white shirt,
white bow
tie and bands.<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: When we spoke at
around this time a year ago, you had just had a new book
published, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Healer-Nazareth-Eric-Eve/dp/0281060010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266323360&amp;sr=8-1">The
Healer from Nazareth: Jesus' Miracles in Historical
Context</a>. How
has its reception been since?</span>
<br><br>
Eric: I haven&#8217;t exactly been overwhelmed with feedback on it
yet, but the reviews I&#8217;ve seen so far have been very favourable, and I
now have another book contract from the same publisher (for a book
about the
oral tradition behind the Gospels).
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: Do you have any
personal contact with another Oxford academic who has made a
minor contribution or two to IF, Graham Nelson?<br><br>

</span>Eric: I&#8217;ve not had a great deal of personal contact with
him,
but we have met for lunch a couple of times.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: But we are
actually here to discuss IF, and, more specifically, your entry
this year, Snowquest. You mention in your notes to that game that you
decided
to force yourself to work within the confines of the .z8 format rather
than
allowing yourself the expansive luxury of Glulx, in the hopes of
producing an
end result that was leaner and more focused than some of your earlier
efforts.
How do you feel about this decision in retrospect? Would Snowquest have
been a
better game if you had had more storyspace to work in, or do you think
the
restriction produced the effect intended?</span>
<br><br>
Eric: I have slightly mixed feelings, to be honest. I decided to
restrict <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>
to .z8 format for a variety of reasons: partly to counter my
tendency to write games that are a bit too big for the IF-Comp, partly
as a
technical challenge, and partly so that the colours would work properly
in the
exit lister. I&#8217;m reasonably happy that keeping <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span> to z8
format
broadly achieved these objectives, but there were places where the
implementation could have been deeper if I&#8217;d allowed myself to switch
to
Glulx, although then there&#8217;d have been the danger than I&#8217;d have
ended up making the game too big again! So, in the main I&#8217;m reasonably
happy with my decision to restrict <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>
to Z-Code, but I very much doubt
it&#8217;s a restriction I&#8217;ll be in any hurry to place on myself again.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: The aspect of
Snowquest that impressed me most is the barren winter
landscape that is the setting for most of the game. Do you have any
personal
experience with mountaineering, or did you draw your impressions
entirely from
books and other background research? Anything you found particularly
inspirational in this regard?<br><br>

</span>Eric: I have no personal experience of mountaineering at
all, and I
didn&#8217;t consciously do any research for the game, so the impressions
must
have been drawn from books, films, photographs, and my imagination.
Well, that
and my personal experience of snow; quite apart from the odd amounts of
snow
we&#8217;ve had in Britain from time to time, I have spend four Januaries in
Vermont, the first of which (in 2000) was very cold and snowy indeed.
<p class="MsoNormal">For whatever reason, the idea of a
trek across a barren
snow-clad landscape to find some source of ancient wisdom in a mountain
was the
generative image of the game; but this was an idea that popped more or
less
fully-formed into my mind from no obvious particular source.</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: Conversely, most
of my criticisms of Snowquest come when the game departs
from this straightforward story of survival, as in the long Blade
Runner-esque
dream sequence and the ending. I felt at times like you tried to cram
too much
into too small a game (see the question above), and that the game might
have worked
better if it had remained entirely in the mountains. Are you satisfied
with the
overall structure of the game?<br><br>

</span>Eric: Yes, broadly, apart from the ending (more on which
below). I
wanted to do something a bit different in <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>, and not
least to try to
confound player expectations. If I&#8217;d kept it as a straightforward
survival story, I wouldn&#8217;t have felt that the game had done anything
interesting
or new. One could, I suppose, imagine a version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span> minus the
early
dream sequence which ended with the protagonist triumphantly
discovering &nbsp;the
Book of Yashor (and perhaps returning to Old Mundle with its secrets),
but
then, however well crafted it may have been, it would have been just
another &nbsp;rather
predictable fetch-quest. Indeed, a very early version of (or perhaps,
precursor
to) <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>
was rather like that, and I wasn&#8217;t at all pleased with the
result. I felt the game needed some kind of twist at the end to be
ultimately
satisfying.
<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;m aware that more than a few
players didn&#8217;t like
the dream sequences or the twist at the end or the way <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span> played
with
perceptions of reality, but I&#8217;m still happier to have ended up with
something a bit risky and controversial rather than something
completely safe, conventional,
and a bit too predictable. In a way, reading the variety of differing
opinions
reviewers have expressed about the game, and the various ways in which
they
have tried to interpret it, is more rewarding that winning the IF-Comp
with
something more straightforward might have been.<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: You did mention to
me in our preparations for this interview that you had
two possible endings in mind for Snowquest, and that you now regret
choosing
the one the you did. Can you tell us what the other ending would have
been, and
why you now wish you had gone that way instead?<br><br></span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>Eric: Sure, but I should first issue a major spoiler
warning for
people who are thinking of playing the post-comp release, which
incorporates a
version of the other ending: you might want to skip over my answers to
the next
two questions until you&#8217;ve played the new version. (If you&#8217;re not
planning to play the post-comp release, or you&#8217;ve already played it,
then
by all means read on).
<p class="MsoNormal">The earliest alpha and beta versions
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span>
ended with a
form of the FBI agent plot in which the parcel really did contain
drugs. This
was even less satisfactory than the ending released for the
competition, as became
immediately apparent from tester feedback. I then came up with a
completely
different ending in which Mr Wolf was a visitor from the future who had
come
back in time to stop Jennifer crashing in the storm on the way to
Farpoint
Weather Station, since this visitor from the future knew that Benjamin
Yashor&#8217;s weather measurements would prove critical to countering
climate
change in his timeline, but couldn&#8217;t take place unless the electronic
components carried by the PC were safely delivered. In many ways this
ending
tied in much better with the themes of the first part of the story, but
in its
beta version it seemed to create more problems than it
solved.&nbsp; Not least
of these was that the figure from the future was now friendly instead
of
threatening, so the ending presented no final challenge, and no scope
for the
final stick-throwing puzzle which many beta testers really liked. Also,
this
time-traveling ending seemed to create an insuperable number of plot
holes. I
therefore went back to a version of the false FBI agent plot, which
gave the
player a clear challenge at the end, while trying to salvage some of
the best
parts of the time-traveling ending, such as the importance of the
weather
measurements at Farpoint. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another issue I was originally
concerned about was the whole
credibility of the time-traveler ending: your own comment elsewhere
that you
were glad that Snowquest turned out to have a mundane ending was the
kind of
reaction I was anticipating in making Wolf a false FBI agent rather
than a
visitor from the future, which I feared some players might find just
too
far-fetched.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So at the time the false FBI agent
plot seemed like the least
bad choice, but in the light of the reviews I&#8217;ve since read I think I
probably ended up with the worst of all worlds. On the one hand the
false FBI
agent plot didn&#8217;t really fit well with the first part of the story,
while
on the other hand the elements borrowed from the time-traveling plot
didn&#8217;t cohere too well with the false FBI agent plot. Moreover, while I
thought I&#8217;d covered the plot problems reasonably well, I obviously
didn&#8217;t do so in a way that satisfied most players, either (in some
cases)
because they failed to notice the explanations given, or (in others)
because
they didn&#8217;t find them credible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the wisdom of hindsight I
think I would have done better to stick with the time-traveler plot
and try to
sort out the problems with it (which is what I&#8217;ve done in the post-comp
release). Even if that risked alienating some players who might prefer
something more mundane, it would have made Snowquest more thematically
coherent
overall. The time traveling plot is arguably a better match with the
slightly
surreal nature of the earlier vision, and the explanations given by a
time-traveler
from the future could have been a much better match to the events and
images of
the first part of the game than those given by a false FBI agent.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">SPAG:
Sarah Morayati, author of Broken Legs and whose own SPAG interview
follows
yours, is running a Post-Comp Comp for authors who were not satisfied
with
their games as first released to have another chance to polish and
bug-fix
their work. You just mentioned that you revised the ending for this
version. Can
you tell us about the other changes you've made?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eric: Yes, the ending is the main
thing that&#8217;s different in the
post-comp version I&#8217;m submitting to Sarah&#8217;s competition. Basically,
I&#8217;ve gone back to the time-travel plot (which I now think would have
worked better all along), while trying to iron out some of the wrinkles
that
made me hesitate about it first time round. If nothing else, Sarah&#8217;s
comp
will give me a good opportunity to see how some people react to this
different
ending.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The other changes are
fairly minor, mainly fixing the odd bug
and typo that turned up in the comp version (thank you everyone who
sent in a
transcript or pointed out a problem in a review). I cut out the tennis
game
scene from the early dream sequence (mainly to give myself more room to
play
with in the revised ending, but also because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be
much missed). I&#8217;ve also slightly tweaked the conversation with Old
Mundle
so that he&#8217;s a bit less heavy-handed in prompting the player what to
ask
next.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: </span>You also
produced another game earlier this year, this one a World War II
period mystery called <a href="./spag56.html#shelter">Shelter
from the Storm</a>. While I have you here, perhaps
you could tell us a bit about that worthy effort's inspiration and
writing
process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eric:
Following various discussions on RAIF I&#8217;d for some time
wanted to write a game in which people could try out different
narrative voices
and tenses to see which worked best for them. The immediate inspiration
for the
story was the film&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051759/"><span style="font-style: italic;">I Was Monty&#8217;s Double</span></a>,
which I&#8217;d
just watched on DVD while looking for plot ideas. In that film an actor
who
looks a bit like General Montgomery stands in for him while the real
Montgomery
is preparing for D-Day (in order to mislead the Germans). This gave me
the idea
of an actor being employed by British intelligence to impersonate a
senior
officer, but to vary the idea I made it a German who was to be
impersonated.
Putting the action in a remote country house suited the plot reasonably
well,
but also suited the format of IF, allowing a limited cast of characters
and a
limited geography, the storm being a convenient plot device to force
the
protagonist into the house and keep him there. The idea of locating the
house
on the edge of Salisbury Plain came directly from my father&#8217;s war
reminiscences, since he was posted to Salisbury Plain (to work on a
mock-up of
the Siegfried Line) on receiving his commission in the Royal Engineers
in 1940.&nbsp;From that point on it was largely a question of
devising a plot
with just
enough characters to create a number of plausible suspects for the
murder
mystery, of planting the right clues in the right places, and then
orchestrating the action to plug any obvious plot holes (with a great
deal of
help from my beta testers) and to have the protagonist solve the
mystery at
about the right point in the story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG:
One thing that always strikes me about so many of your games is that
they take
place in quite vividly imagined and well-developed storyworlds.
Certainly the
universes of (for instance) <a href="../s.html#square">Square
Circle</a> and <a href="../e.html#elysium">The
Elysium Enigma</a> could support
many more stories, yet you've never indulged in sequels. Is this a
conscious
choice, as in Arthur C. Clarke's famous declaration that he "doesn't do
sequels" before he, well, started to do (mostly wretched) sequels, or
are
you just too excited by the next storyworld to dwell in the previous
one too
long?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eric: I haven&#8217;t made any deliberate
policy decision not to do
sequels, but I&#8217;ve tended not to do them because I&#8217;ve been trying to
do something a bit different with each new game (at least, different
for me, if
not necessarily different from other IF). There&#8217;s also always been the
sneaking worry that a sequel might not live up to the original, but end
up as
something of a sub-standard derivative rehash.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The two examples you cite
are rather different. The genesis of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Square Circle</span>
was the eponymous puzzle; everything else was devised to give the
puzzle a reasonably interesting setting. If that ended up creating a
universe
rich enough to support other stories, that&#8217;s just a happy accident!
It&#8217;s very different with <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Elysium Enigma</span>, the universe of which has
been with me for many decades, and in which I&#8217;ve written (and
rewritten)
a number of extremely amateurish novels that should certainly never be
published. So that universe not only could support, but already has
supported,
many more stories, if only in my imagination.</p>
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: I haven't done an
exhaustive inventory, but I suspect you to be the most
prolific IF author of the past five or six years, even out-producing
the
tireless Emily Short. Like Emily, your contributions to IF's technical
and
philosophical underpinnings have also been immense. So, a simple
question: why
do you do it? Some aspects of IF development are of course great fun,
but
there's quite a lot of difficult drudgery in polishing a game for
release, and
the global readership is not exactly, shall we say, immense. Are the
rewards
worth the labors? (But then again they must be, right? Else why would
you do
it?)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Eric: Well, I suspect there have been
several equally prolific authors
(David Whyld is one that springs to mind who has been vastly more
prolific than
I), but to answer your question, I do it because I enjoy it. As you
say, some
aspects of IF development are great fun, and even aspects of the
beta-testing
phase can be enjoyable, not least seeing testers&#8217; reactions and
thrashing
out ideas with them. But, as you also say, there&#8217;s also quite a lot of
difficult drudgery which one just have to grit one&#8217;s teeth and get on
with. Two things make the rewards worth the labours: the first is the
chance to
indulge my creativity in a form in which I seem to be reasonably
proficient, and
the second is the feedback from players. Although the global readership
for IF
is relatively tiny, the proportion of that readership that write
reviews or give
other kinds of feedback is relatively huge, and subjectively it&#8217;s the
volume of feedback more than the number of readers that makes the
effort feel
worthwhile. To give a concrete example, writing and polishing <span style="font-style: italic;">Snowquest</span> was
considerably less work than writing and polishing <span style="font-style: italic;">The Healer from Nazareth</span>,
but I&#8217;ve seen far more reviews of my latest IF than I have of my latest
book!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That said, I doubt I shall
be quite so prolific in the future,
or at least the immediate future. For one thing, I shouldn&#8217;t be
surprised
if taking on the role of Assessor leaves me less time for IF during my
year of
office. For another my current WIP is one I want to take my time over,
so I don&#8217;t
expect I shall be releasing any IF works in 2010.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: In addition to being a
newcomer on the IF scene, it's my
understanding that you're also a bit younger than many of us. That's
always refreshing to see! Perhaps we could open this interview by
having you introduce yourself to SPAG's readers and tell a little bit
about yourself.'</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: I'm
a student at UNC, finishing up my third year. I'm studying English and
journalism, which unfortunately means that what I'll be doing in five
years or so is anyone's guess, although it'd hopefully involve some
sort of writing. On the more personal side, I'm a latent theater geek,
as well as your garden-variety geek. My non-IF hobbies include
collecting CDs, reading everything I can find and thinking of less rote
ways to describe my hobbies.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: Where did you first
learn about IF, and what about the form
interested you so much that you decided to put into it the huge
commitment that is required to produce a game of the polish and
complexity of Broken Legs?</span>
<br><br>

Sarah:&nbsp;I'd known about IF for almost a decade, actually -- I
used to spend a
lot of time on this online games site Free Arcade, and they had a
section for "text adventures." It had <span style="font-style: italic;">Adventure</span>, some of
the Scott
Adams games, the works. And somehow, this was the best part of the
site. I don't know why. But a subsequent Google (well, at the time it'd
be AltaVista) trawl led me to the Adventure Blaster compilation, which
I still think is one of the best introductions to IF for newbies out
there if about a decade outdated. It got me into IF, at any rate.<br>
<br>
As far as writing, I'd first told myself that I was going to enter
the 2008 comp, but after a month or so, it became pretty sure that my
Inform 6 coding exercise of a cave crawl wasn't exactly going to do
very well. I certainly wasn't proud of it, so why should anyone else
be? And then the comp deadline rolled around and I started to really
regret that decision -- enough to tell myself that no matter&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">what</span>
happened, I was entering in the 2009 comp with something I could be
proud of.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: You've mentioned
that you've spent some time around theater circles,
and that's pretty clear from your game as well. Would you care to tell
us a bit more about these experiences?</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: I was a huge chorus and musical theater geek in high school.
Think&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Glee</span>
without the AutoTune. My sister was more into it than I was, but
I still did a few productions -- school revues, children's theater,
community shows, the like. Once I got to college, though, most of this
stopped; my questionable acting skills, absolute lack of anything
resembling dance skills and sudden escalation of time spent at the
newspaper shut that down pretty quickly. My sister did, though. Last
year, she'd fly out to New York and California and all over the country
a couple times every month auditioning for schools. And while, from
everything I've heard, her experience doesn't really resemble <span style="font-style: italic;">Broken
Legs</span> (thank god), it was nevertheless my inspiration.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: In writing Broken
Legs not only did you have to deal with all of the
usual complexity of writing a substantial work of IF, but you also
overhauled the standard Inform parser's normal responses to a greater
extent than I can recall seeing since last year's Violet, and that's a
major, often frustrating undertaking in itself. Perhaps you can tell us
about the development process of the game, and how long each stage took.</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: The
basic idea of the game had existed since last fall, but it was just
that -- an idea, a vaguely sketched room, some flavor responses and
nothing more. I didn't really have Lottie's voice down yet. I had
absolutely no plot save an amoebic idea of what would have been a
terrible puzzlefest. (Search the cabinet, which is in a waiting room
for some reason, to find the milk that was somehow left in there, and
pour it into the conveniently placed water bottle...) From time to time
I'd attempt to hammer out characters, puzzles and/or a plot, but it
went nowhere.<br>
<br>
And then everything came together one afternoon. I know it's
clich&#233;d to describe it as an epiphany, but that's exactly what it was.
All the characters, what they were like, how they'd interact with each
other, the like. So I spent a couple hours diagramming things and went
from there. While there were slight changes from the initial plan (it
wasn't originally going to be as sequential as it ended up, but that
would have required about five times the time and coding; Mary was
originally supposed to just back out after witnessing all of the
sabotage, but I thought that was a cop-out; that sort of thing), the
finished product more or less resembles what I wrote down that day.<br>
<br>
What wasn't a part of this vision was the ending. This was more of
a "hmm, it'd be sort of cool if..." thought midway through coding one
day. And eventually, with some input from ifMUD to make sure it wasn't
complete crap, I rewrote/re-tinkered a few parts of the game to
accommodate it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: When one thinks of
Broken Legs, one aspect -- more specifically, one
unforgettable character -- tends to rather overshadow its many
interesting aspects. I speak, of course, of the PC, Lottie Plum. You've
made it clear in other places that Lottie is not (thank God) you. So,
who is she? Do you know her? (I hope not.)</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: Lottie
is not me. Honest! I thought I should get that out there again. She's a
mix of several different people, including (I'm ashamed to say) me
during middle school. But then, she isn't so implausible. Look at the
titles of a bunch of Broadway songs -- "I'm the Greatest Star," the
like. Look at the character types reality TV, advertising, and the like
are pushing onto kids at younger and younger ages. While her
character's obviously exaggerated for humor, it's far from
inconceivable that she could really exist.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: What was it like
spending so long with Lottie? Did you ever feel the
urge to start making catty, disparaging comments about everyone and
everything around you? Did you ever wish, after spending countless
hours with her, that you'd chosen to make Lottie just a bit nicer?</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: It
wasn't exactly pleasant. It frightened me how effortless it was to
write in her voice, which of course spurred all sorts of angsting about
"does this mean she's really me?" There was a period during beta
testing where I couldn't stand to look at the game. I hated that I had
spawned it, hated that I had gotten too far to give up, and hated that
I was about to unleash this person upon the world. Of course, some of
this might have just been the fact that I was in the middle of beta
testing. And I eventually got over it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: As you <a href="http://selfasfractal.blogspot.com/2009/11/talking-on-broken-legs_23.html">wrote
recently in your blog</a>, Broken Legs is one of a
dismayingly small percentage of IF that passes the <a href="http://www.amptoons.com/blog/the-mo-movie-measure/">Bechdel
test</a>,
meaning essentially that it contains substantial interactions among at
least two named females, and that these interactions do not revolve
exclusively around the subject of men. This is not really a surprise,
of course, when we consider that IF arose out of and is still largely
beholden to the still male-dominated tech/nerd culture, and that the
creation of believable character interaction is still a sore spot in IF
theory. That's also a big reason that having a voice like yours working
in the form feels so refreshing. And yet on the other hand, as you also
mention in your blog, your game does not exactly paint women in the
most positive light. Do you feel like a Traitor To Your Sex? Okay, I'm
just being silly... but I am interested in knowing more about your
thoughts on these subjects, if you'd care to share them.</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: First,
I'd just like to make it clear that this phenomenon is by no means
restricted to IF. It's a big issue in TV and film, for instance -- I
think the canonical example was that the only movie one person could
think of was Alien, because two women were talking about the alien. If
a smash hit has mostly male characters, nobody raises an eyebrow, but
if it has mostly female characters, it's a Great Big Anomaly worth
several trees' worth of shocked speculation. So if IF has the same
problem, it's a reflection of the culture more than anything.<br>
<br>
That said, I definitely did struggle with this. On the one hand, I
do try to have female characters in everything I write, as much because
that's what I know as because I'm trying to make a tiny dent in things.
On the other hand, nobody in <span style="font-style: italic;">Broken
Legs</span> is exactly a role model. Part
of this comes with the environment -- it's significantly more
competitive for women in theater just because there are more of them --
but that obviously doesn't let me off the hook.<br>
<br>
I should note, though, that the characters aren't all equally
horrible. I was a bit surprised when a couple reviewers implied this.
Seraphina, for instance, isn't so bad, or at least I wasn't trying to
portray her as such. And you have to keep in mind that everything you
see about the characters is heavily filtered through the PC's eyes, and
she's hardly an egalitarian. In some places this is more clear than
others.<br>
<br>
Finally, the male characters are, if not as prominent, as bad as
the female characters. If you had to ask me who the absolute worst
character in the game was, I'd say Richard Plum. That bit about the
hitman isn't an exaggeration.<br><br>
<b>
</b><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: I
mentioned in my own review of Broken Legs that in overhauling the
Inform parser so totally in service of its characterization it reminded
me of <a href="./spag53.html#Violet">Violet</a>. I
have to say that it also reminded me of Violet in
another way: much of its enjoyment for me was spoiled by puzzles that I
just found too hard, unfairly so. How do you feel about the puzzle
design in retrospect -- and do you plan to make changes in a new
release?<br><br></span>
<b>
</b>Sarah: Well, puzzle design is something completely new to me.
I've
been writing for years, and I'd done some dabbling in programming, but
neither of these really prepared me for making puzzles -- or, as the
case may be, making puzzles that are comprehensible to others. This
constantly came up in beta testing; if anything, the initial version
was even more unclued than what made it to the comp. While I'd still
keep the basic design of the game if I were to do it over again,
there's a lot I have to learn by way of cluing puzzles.<br>
<br>
That said, I do plan to address a lot of this in the post-comp
release. It'll be a bit delayed -- the work I planned to get done this
month got derailed by about a million things at once -- but it'll
exist. Hopefully it'll be finished or near-finished by the time you
read this.<br><br>
<b>
</b><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: You're
holding a Post-Comp Comp for authors who wish they'd done a
better job of preparing and polishing their games first time around.
Care to tell us a bit more about it?</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: I
came up with the idea after eavesdropping (it was during the judging
period, so I couldn't do much more than eavesdrop) on ifMUD on #craft.
The conversation eventually turned to the fact that there's no shortage
of bugs, mistakes and generally poor choices in comp games, but there's
a huge shortage of post-comp releases. It's not restricted to
newcomers, either; it's an across-the-board shortage. And since so many
out-of-comp releases are raising the bar again and again, some people
were worried that the Comp would develop a reputation as a dumping
ground for half-finished, halfhearted games. So I floated the idea for
the Post-Comp-Comp on the authors' forum, and I was pleased to see that
there was so much interest. Anything that inspires people to improve
the body of IF is good in my book.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: I understand that
you've got some other IF projects on the go. Any
teasers you'd like to share?</span><br>
<br>
Sarah: Barring
another major real-life intrusion -- and I'm pretty sure I've used up
my quota of those for the year -- I'm entering the 2010 comp. The
idea's pretty sketchily formed at the moment, but I'll drop this hint:
it's horror. <br>
<br>
The other project I've got in the works is an even bigger
departure. It's puzzleless, for one. It's going to be real-time -- it's
the reason why I coded the Basic Real Time extension -- with a
soundtrack. Right now it's only in extremely skeletal form, but I'm
hoping to get it done at least in the next few years. I probably won't
release it in the comp.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">[Sarah was also kind
enough to put me in touch with the star of Broken Legs, Ms. Lottie Plum
herself. So, without further ado...]</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: So, Lottie, when
Sarah came to you to ask if she could write a game
about your experiences in the world of theater, what was your initial
reaction? Why did you decide to say okay?</span>
<br><br>
Lottie: My initial reaction? Like, what initial reaction was I supposed
to
have? I thought she was like a complete freak and basically nobody who
ever needed to exist anywhere in the world. But then she said I'd be
sort of famous. And if someone is such a no-life that they're going to
promote me places why would I turn it down? It's not like <span style="font-style: italic;">American Idol</span>
ever called me back.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: Have you played
much IF yourself?</span><br>
<br>
Lottie: No. I have better
things to do and I'm actually really surprised that I'm wasting my time
with this interview thing. It doesn't even have cameras.<br><br>
<b>
</b><span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: Were you
surprised when Broken Legs took second place in the Comp?
Or were you disappointed that you and Sarah was not able to manage any
clever sabotage to knock Rover's Day Out out of the running? On the
other hand, there were a host of weird interpreter problems with Rover,
weren't there? Hmm... Lottie, were you at work behind the scenes after
all???</span><br>
<br>
Lottie: Well, it's not like I was happy because there is just no way I
should
be beaten by some stupid story about a dog. Like, it was so ridiculous
that I didn't even play the thing. Why would I? I don't like go around
watching other people play my roles or sing my songs. So they just
totally deserved whatever was screwy about it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: So, how's it going
for you now at Bridger? Or have you already made
the leap to Broadway?</span><br>
<br>
Lottie: We&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span>
talk about that. Period. Oh, and I'm not speaking to you anymore. Bye.<br>

<p>Jack: By day, I'm involved in cancer research, so there isn't
much of
a connection to IF or other forms of creative writing. As part of work,
I have been known to write the occasional program or script to make my
life easier, but I'm not a professional programmer by a long shot.</p>
<p>I had played IF back in the mid-1980s, mostly on my 16k <a target="_blank" href="http://classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/">PMC-80</a>,
a TRS-80 clone -- yes, green and white text and programs on cassette
tape. I started off with playing some Adventure International games,
which were miracles of compactness. In 1986, a friend introduced me to
the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>
game</a>.
It was the first time I had played an Infocom title and also the first
time I had touched a Mac. I didn't sleep for the next 30 hours or so. I
absolutely loved that game. After that, there's a big gap up to around
2006 when Ben mentioned in passing that IF isn't dead. He told me about
the IF community and inform, showed me RAIF, and let me loose on an
unsuspecting world. <span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="334,340,link%2Fmanual,http%3A%2F%2Fclassic-computers.org.nz%2Fsystem-80%2F:555,592,link%2Fmanual,http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifwiki.org%2Findex.php%2FThe_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy:" __wave_xml="By day, I'm involved in cancer research, so there isn't much of a connection to IF or other forms of creative writing.

<p><span>Ben: </span>For a while I was working in
the Chicago theater community as a
professional sound designer and musical theater composer, but
eventually I had to choose the more traditional path of being a
professional programmer. I was a co-designer/founder of the Subversion
version control system back in 2000, and then became a co-founder of
the Chicago Google Engineering office in 2005. I now manage a team of
about 10 Google engineers. If you've ever hosted an open source project
at <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/">code.google.com</a>,
that's the product I develop by day.</p>
<p>My
first exposure to IF was as a 9 year old kid on my Apple IIe; my mom
brought home Infocom's&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Deadline</span>
and I was hooked. The plot was too
complex for me, but in my tweens I really got into <span style="font-style: italic;">Trinity</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hitchhiker's</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Leather Goddesses</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Suspect</span>,
and my absolute favorite -- <span style="font-style: italic;">A
Mind Forever Voyaging</span>. I then accidentally rediscovered IF
a decade
later when I stumbled across Graham's z-machine work in the late 90's.
I was running a z-interpreter on my Apple Newton and watching Inform 6
evolve. I quietly watched RAIF through most of the aughties, playing
each year's IFComp winners, but remained a relatively silent
fanboy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">SPAG: In doing a bit of

<p>Ben: I think I accidentally introduced Jack to the Inform
language when he,
after a long D&amp;D session as gamemaster, pointed out that one of
his
scenarios would work perfectly as a solo text adventure. I drafted up a
sketch of what it would look like in Inform 7, and I think this got him
excited about writing text adventures -- he immediately jumped into
Inform 6 and wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Nine-Tenths

she runs every year. Jack and I each participated in that as a way of
"learning" Inform; nothing forces you to learn faster than a deadline!
It allowed us to get our "newbie first games" out of our systems, which
are typically pretty awful in the "hello world" sense. One gets so
involved in the learning the technical intricacies of the language that
you lose sight of the important things like story and character.

<p><span>Jack: </span>Mostly it translates, except
for scale and difficulty. The complexity
of IF games climbs very quickly when you start adding more props, more
characters, and more degrees of freedom of action. While this richness
and open-endedness is fine when you've got a live person moderating the
game, it's a steep task for rule-driven game mechanics plus a parser.
As for difficulty, particularly for verbal puzzles, something that may
fly in a group of ten players working in parallel may come across as
poorly clued and all but insurmountable in IF. In a group, each person
can pitch in their own take on a puzzle, and people play off each
other's insights and incremental advances, but in IF the hinting has to
be more obvious and persistent, and there needs to be some way around
the really difficult puzzles. Apologies for certain puzzles in

very interesting to learn that you both come from a tabletop RPG
background. Perhaps I detect the beginning of a trend here; some other
authors who have a splash in IF circles in the last few years --
notably Victor Gijsbers and S. John Ross -- also cut their teeth in the
realm of funny-looking dice. And of course it would be great to forge
stronger links between these two hobbies. (Says the guy who spent two

<p><span>Jack: </span>Sure. I don't want to overplay
the RPG angle -- we tend to play
a couple games a year, and those games don't pay much attention to the
commercial reference material, we just sort of roll our own, playing
somewhat fast and loose with rules in favor of more "dramatic"
sessions. That ability to toss away the rules on a whim makes it hard

<p><span>Ben: </span>The key element of good RPG

compelling stories. That's Jack's big strength. I think my own strength
comes more from the theater community -- I have an overdeveloped sense
of drama. When Jack erupts in a font of ideas, I tend to direct and
narrow them down into a story arc that "feels" right.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="The key element of good RPG experience is the ability to invent compelling stories.

<p>Jack emailed me a
complete 'screenplay' -- a hypothetical transcript of the game -- in
May 2009. I was so excited by it, I volunteered to help him write it.
From there, I took on the role of Editor/Producer/Co-Implementor. Jack
had all the brilliant ideas and writing, and I introduced him to
standard software development practices. I suspect we may the first
team ever to use version control and a bug tracker to collaborate on a
game! Most authors write alone, so the need for collaborative software
tools isn't so great. But I recommend them to everyone, even if working
solo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jack: This pseudo-transcript took about three months to write,
while I
fought down the compulsion to start coding. Having this reference
document in hand was central to our collaboration, as we could work on
different sections while remaining consistent with the overall
structure. In retrospect, I wish we had solicited more comments at this
stage. The reference document "baked in" a number of design decisions
that proved unpopular in general distribution. Some of the plot
elements and game mechanics were too ingrained to fix when we received
comments about them during beta-testing or after the actual release of
the game.</p>
<p>Taking this experience into consideration,
during development of the reference document for our next project,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hoosegow</span>,
we asked a broad group of reviewers for comments ranging from
overall plot and voice to fairness of the puzzles and technical
implementation. We're hoping that this will improve that next game in
ways that beta-testing can't address.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="This pseudotranscript took about three months to write, while I fought down the compulsion to start coding.

<p>Ben: Honestly, we sort of
sniffed our way through the collaboration at first. We were timid when
we first started implementing the story. We weren't even entirely sure
it would be something worthy of entering into IFComp; this was meekly
decided later on.</p>
<p>Our process was typical software
engineering. We started with a design document (the imaginary game
transcript), then filed tasks in the issue tracker which we then 'took'
for ourselves to prevent stepping on each other's feet. I had to teach
Jack how to use the Mercurial version control system, but once he
figured out merging, we were all set. After three months we had a
workable game, followed by a month of beta-testing (with 8 friends!)
and bug-fixing. The <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/rovers-day-out" style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(102, 77, 159);">whole

<p>In
a nutshell: Jack has all the great ideas, and I'm more often the
editor. [Jack inserts an editorial comment here: sometimes, this is not
the case and roles are reversed]. I help shape the flood into a
reasonable stream. :-) And I think this is one of the secret-sauces to
any creative endeavor, whether it be writing, composing music, making

Jack: </span>I've enjoyed the collaborative nature of the
project, and
completely second Ben's comment about having someone to bounce things
off. Everyone needs a little reality check now and then.
<p>On
a technical note, collaborative tools really reduce the burden of
getting this sort of project done. The reference document for RDO was
written in GoogleDocs, where could both work on it at the same time.
For our current project, we drafted the document in Google Wave, and
had our early phase reviewers directly edit and comment within that
shared space. Formal version control for the project code added some
overhead, but it was well worth it. We now have a team of loyal
beta-testers who are contributing bug reports (all too regularly) via
project issue trackers. I'm not sure I would remained this organized if
I were working on a solo project, so the very fact that this is a
collaborative project keeps me both motivated and adds discipline.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="I've enjoyed the collaborative nature of the project, and completely second Ben's comment about having someone to bounce things off.

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Jack: </span>My
intention at the beginning was to write a game based on
false narrative, but have it be fair to the player. RDO isn't based on
a specific story, but is a reaction to the sort of story where
characters are in some kind of artificial world, and find out at some
point that -- surprise -- they're not in the real world, they're in
some sort of construct. And then the scales fall away, and they can see
the big picture. That sort of a story feels unfair, in the same way as
a bad detective novel that never gives the reader enough to solve the
crime. So, the intention here was to give the player some sense that
what they're seeing and hearing isn't the full story. Since the work is
interactive, my intention was to give the player some agency in peeling
back the layers of illusion over the course of the game, arriving at
the end with an accurate view of the game world.</p>
<p>While
thinking along those lines, I had the idea to include side commentary
from David and Janet, a sort of in-game fourth wall. I started off
thinking that their comments would mainly be humorous, like the talking
heads in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystery
Science Theater 3K</span>, but as I played with the dialog
(and hunted for an ending), it occurred to me that their dialog could
provide establishing background early in the story and that the
characters themselves could enter into the story towards the conclusion.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Jack: </span>I
agree that there is a tendency to write towards linearity
when drafting a document that reads from top to bottom, but one way or
another, the ideas have to get down into some medium so we can discuss
them. It felt natural to write the game more or less in the order of
events within a text editor. Even in the RDO transcript, though, I put
in some parenthetical notes about flow control, i.e., what would happen
at nodal points in the story. We did not map out a formal skein because
the number of branch points wasn't excessive, and some tended to join
up again later in the story, but I think it would be reasonable to
write labels into the transcript and sketch out a reference skein for
more complicated projects.</p>
<p>In working on our present
project (<span style="font-style: italic;">Hoosegow</span>),
we had the same concerns about linearity, so we
started with a graphic representation of the puzzles and the various
end states, and then created a network showing which combinations of
actions would be required to reach those end states, and which key
intermediate states would be prerequisites. Then, we wrote the
transcript top to bottom with reference to those states. That hybrid
approach lends itself well to developing puzzles with multiple
solutions and games with multiple outcomes.</p>
<p>We'll keep
experimenting with ways to draft and refine the game during design, and
I doubt we'll ever choose the same method twice.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="I agree that there is a tendency to write towards linearity when drafting a document that reads from top to bottom, but one way or another, the ideas have to get down into some medium so we can discuss them.

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Jack: </span>Funny,
huh? For us it was a month of knuckle-biting self-doubt
and confusion. On one hand, we had some very positive responses, on the
other hand, I know that some people felt the game was good in a
technical sense, just not fun. I feel like we particularly failed in
that latter case, because our intention was to tell a fun story. I will
say that the reviews that were published during the Comp were very
helpful for understanding why our story turned off some people, and
that feedback should help us with future projects.</p>
<p>I was
surprised about some sources of criticism. It seems to me that sci-fi
has been so overdone in IF that many people are automatically biased
against the genre; all things being equal I think stories that are not
based in sci-fi will generally do better in the Comp. From general
reaction, I would also note many players have a very low tolerance for
technobabble (even technobabble based on real science).</p>
<p>I
was also surprised by the number of comments we got about making the
status-bar a source of information in the game. I heard a lot of , "but
I *never* look at the status bar!" comments, which begs the question of
why we have status bars. I suppose the obvious answer is "to give
status, not critical information."</p>
<p>The big one, though was
the repetition. You have to do the same mundane tasks several times.
Yes, we knew this was annoying, and we tried to abbreviate it as best
we could but cutting the repetition early in the practice runs and
allowing some streamlining in the later game. When we revised RDO for
post-Comp release, we have tweaked this further, but we cannot entirely
get rid of it. As I said, it's a design decision that was baked into
the game at an early point. The central story in RDO concerns an AI
that has to work through tasks in a specific order. To the AI, each run
is new. It wouldn't be self-consistent to have things work differently
in later runs. Our hope was that the player would see the earlier runs
as a learning experience, and that the repetition was pay off later in
the game when the player has to not only repeat some of the tasks, but
understand what they mean.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="Funny, huh? For us it was a month of knuckle-biting self-doubt and confusion.

It seems to me that sci-fi has been so overdone in IF that many people are automatically biased against the genre; all things being equal I think stories that are not based in sci-fi will generally do better in the Comp. From general reaction, I would also note many players have a very low tolerance for technobabble (even technobabble based on real science). &lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;I was also surprised by the number of comments we got about making the status-bar a source of information in the game. I heard a lot of , &quot;but I *never* look at the status bar!&quot; comments, which begs the question of why we have status bars. I suppose the obvious answer is &quot;to give status, not critical information.&quot;&lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;line&gt;&lt;/line&gt;The big one, though was the repetition. You have to do the same mundane tasks several times. Yes, we knew this was annoying, and we tried to abbreviate it as best we could but cutting the repetition early in the practice runs and allowing some streamlining in the later game. When we revised RDO for post-Comp release, we have tweaked this further, but we cannot entirely get rid of it. As I said, it's a design decision that was baked into the game at an early point. The central story in RDO concerns an AI that has to work through tasks in a specific order. To the AI, each run is new. It wouldn't be self-consistent to have things work differently in later runs. Our hope was that the player would see the earlier runs as a learning experience, and that the repetition was pay off later in the game when the player has to not only repeat some of the tasks, but understand what they mean."></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span></span>Ben: There was a common pattern I
noticed. People who were already
methodical programmers seemed to enjoy the repetition -- they
immediately recognized the repetition as meaningful and a giant clue
saying "Hmmm, I should be learning something as I do this". And they
were subsequently rewarded later in the game for their "training". Most
normal people (no offense to programmers) Just Want To Do Something
Already, had no patience for the repetition, and didn't even consider
that it might eventually result in delayed gratification. My wife, for
example, who is normally MUCH better at solving IF puzzles than I am,
didn't even finish playing <span style="font-style: italic;">Rover</span>

directions, and we wanted the game to have depth no matter which

<p>Jack: If I were writing a game outside a Comp setting, my
natural inclination
would lean more towards the Zarfian-cruel end of the spectrum. The way
we implemented this boarding scene in <span style="font-style: italic;">RDO</span> did feel a
little too
generous to me, but on the other hand, in beta-testing, most players
flailed around fairly ineffectively during their first playtest. If
zero out of eight meant getting carved to pieces and then blown up, it
would have been a very poor pay off for slogging through the apartment
chores in the earlier part of the game. So, we decided that no matter
what happens, the player would get to the next scene. Our reasoning was
that from the player's perspective, there would still be a sense of
jeopardy (at least the first time they played the game) and that even
if their actions weren't particularly effective, they must have been
doing *something* during that time (hopefully, not hitting
z-repeatedly, hoping for a quick and merciful death in the cold vacuum
of space).<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="If I were writing a game outside a Comp setting, my natural inclination would lean more towards the zarfian-cruel end of the spectrum.

In mid-beta testing, one of testers did us a big favor by being very
frank and saying that the world does not need another dream sequence.
We stepped back and realized that the section didn't work at all as a
dream sequence, but it had already been coded. Consequently, we reached
down the game's throat, ripped out its entrails, jumbled them about and
shoved them back in. That's how we ended up with the current boarding
scene. Adding more finesse wasn't possible within the time constraints
of the comp, and in the post-comp revision, we decided not to change
the nature of the game dramatically.<span class="__wave_paste" __wave_annotations="" __wave_xml="The dreadful truth is, we had originally made that section a dream.

<p>From the beginning of the
Comp, we had an interesting experience with interpreters. The Comp
recommended Spatterlight, and within a few hours of the Comp going
live, we got bug reports. We had tested on Spatterlight, but not after
adding the Blue Screen of Death. It turns out that Spatterlight could
not handle a GLK graphic function correctly, so we wrote a patch to
work around it. Next came notices that some of the text showed up
garbled in Gargoyle. That really threw us because we had tested the
game in Gargoyle in both Linux and windows, and considered it a main
platform. In trouble shooting, we learned that it worked just fine on
our 64-bit Linux test machine, but not on 32-bit Linux installations.
Another patch. We wanted it to run on interpreters without status bars
(to make it run on ClubFloyd for instance): another patch. Finally, we
could not run the game on the Java-based zag interpreter. Zag seems not
to have been maintained lately and lacks many of the features required
to play an Inform 7 game, so we had to perform major surgery on RDO to
make it run under Zag.</p>
<p>We also had a number of
interpreter-related issues regarding the formatting of text, for
instance, the conversation between Janet and David. All this boils down
to a lot of heterogeneity in the interpreters. It's not so bad as the
world of web-browsers and their issues with standards compliance, but
it does add a lot to the effort required to really polish a game for a

could serve as the backstory for the escape game.</p>
<p>Escaping from jail is a hackneyed theme (heck, even the Brady
Bunch did it -- see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidbrady.com/eb/buncheps3.html#bunch50">episode
#50</a>),
so we knew we'd have to really put our mark on it to bring it off. Our
plan was to focus on two areas: puzzles and humor. Any grandiose ideas
we had about clever ways of implementing conversation went out the
window when we had five weeks to get the project from concept to code.</p>
<p>Between
family and work commitments, we couldn't really focus on the game until
January, but once we got going, we moved quickly. We shopped the story
concept around to a number of
readers
a number of readers, including a few reviewers that hadn't enjoyed
<span style="font-style: italic;">Rover</span>. Our
intention was to see if we had some blind spots and to try
to get a more broad-based review than we had with <span style="font-style: italic;">Rover</span>.</p>
<p>We
received some really excellent advice on plot and structure, but also
on the process of writing itself, including character development,
setting and style.</p>
<p>As that process was concluding, we translated the prototype
transcript into Inform 7 code, and we were beta-testing the front end of the game
while writing the second. It wasn't a pretty sight, but we managed to
compress six months of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rover</span>
development into about five weeks of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hoosegow</span>
development -- and here, I'm including the first week of the

of Saugus, Massachusetts, holds a <a href="http://www.saugus.net/Contests/Halloween/2009/">Halloween

open to entrants from anywhere in the world. These stories can be
traditional static fiction (the vast majority) or IF. Last year in an
unprecedented explosion no further than three works of IF were entered.
What follows are reviews of those three games.<br>

</table><br></span>While a work of "horror" in the sense that you play an
apparently newly
molded vampire who has just crawled from his grave as the game begins, <span style="font-style: italic;">Awakening </span>is
more Mel Brooks than Anne Rice, playing freely mixing and matching
Gothic
clich&#233;s such as the graveyard, the deserted and run-down cathedral, and
the creepy old caretaker. It's very old school in its construction,
perhaps unsurprisingly in light of the fact that <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=0n0yf75eg6z8mbl9">its
author created a
number of commercial text adventures back in the day</a>, but
thankfully
free of the typical old school annoyances, and generally
well-implemented by the standards of its genre. Its puzzles are
unlikely to stump you for very long, but are enjoyable enough to solve.
There's even an NPC, that being the just mentioned caretaker, who is at
the heart of the most memorable puzzles.<br><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">
</span>Of the three IF works entered into the 2009 Saugus.net
contest, this is
my favorite. It's no masterpiece, but it does what it sets out to do
competently and reasonably successfully, and never really tries the
player's patience in the process.&nbsp;That said, I was left
wishing it
had offered just a little bit more: more personality in its (perfectly
competent) writing, more allowable interactions (particularly with the
caretaker), and just a bit more ambition. Perhaps we'll get those
things in another game from Mr. Gardner; this feels a bit like a first
Inform 7 game pumped up into releasable form. In the meantime, this
game isn't a bad way at all to kill half an hour or so. And welcome
back to IF authorship, Mr. Gardner;&nbsp;I hope to see more of
you.&nbsp;<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">The Lighthouse</span>
is quite a short game, and, as its title would imply, very much
Lovecraftian horror in spirit. It's neither poorly implemented nor
poorly written, but nevertheless broke down for me quite quickly when I
found myself losing faith in it as a piece of fiction. <br>
<br>
You
play a young tourist determined to visit historic and creepy old St.
Buwch Lighthouse. Naturally, the day you visit is marked by a
tremendous downpour. In such circumstances the dead body you find
before you even make it to the lighthouse door hardly comes as a
surprise. Being the protagonist in an adventure game, your first
thought is of course to search the body, on which you discover an empty
bottle of sleeping pills. This leads you to announce to another
character just a little later that he "committed suicide." Would anyone
really leap so definitively to that conclusion from that evidence? One
might say it looks likely he might have committed suicide, but to just
announce it as an open and shut case rather strains credibility.
Further, when asked, "You aren't the Johnson boy, are you?" you reply
that "That must be the young man I found... outside." Again, you
have&nbsp;made quite a conjectural leap, this one even more
breathtaking than the one before. Clearly it's important to the story
that the player come into possession of these facts, but simply
inserting them into the mouth of the protagonist is hardly the proper
way to go about it. I briefly wondered whether I might be the evildoer
covering my tracks -- but, alas, no such twists were forthcoming.
Things get even more absurd a bit later, when you are expected to
attack and kill a heretofore thoroughly unthreatening someone based on
your spotting "a flash from her hand -- as if she's carrying something
made of steel." Perhaps you are&nbsp;playing an omniscient of some
sort.<br>
<br>
In
the end there is a suitably creepy, if firmly genre-bound backstory to
uncover, with some interesting final &nbsp;choices to make that can
lead to one of several endings. Nor is it overly difficult or
frustrating, although it might require a bit of learning by death if
you don't routinely leap to attack people who carry something shiny
into your vicinity. But all its positives are so undone by the clumsy
plotting that they lose all impact. Mr. M&#252;ller has shown himself
capable of producing original, memorable work; his <a style="font-style: italic;" href="./spag53.html#Story">Bedtime
Story</a>
was my favorite of the 2008 Introcomp. With this game, though, he's
rather badly missed the mark, assuming said mark was the creation of
a&nbsp;believable piece of fiction.<br>

</table></span><br><b style="">&gt;INTRO<o:p></o:p></b>

<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ll be upfront: my personal experience probably biases my
interpretation of this story in ways that maybe not everyone else can account
for.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Having taught English in <st1:place w:st="on">Southeast Asia</st1:place> I have a special affinity for the scenes
and characters crafted by Mr. Whittington in <i style="">Love is as Powerful as Death, Jealousy is as Cruel as the Grave</i>;
they all seem just so much more real to me for having my actual experience
there to which I can compare them, and ring true.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>I don&#8217;t wish to say that the game isn&#8217;t flawed --
it has its flaws -- but I do wish to emphasize that I think the narrative in this
Cambodian ghost story stands far above any problems in its coding.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Could it use more polish?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Maybe, but a strong story is already <i style="">there</i>
and on the strength of it I still definitely recommend <i style="">Love is as Powerful as Death</i>.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;CONVERSATION<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the story unfolds through conversation-based
gameplay using the verbs ask, tell, and say.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The writing generally ensures conversational subjects are clearly marked and easy to trigger.&nbsp;<span style=""></span>&gt;TALK TO X or
&gt;TOPICS will re-display available subjects at any time, though sometimes
omitting context-sensitive options.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Topics
are also numerous and varied enough that choice -- or, in a few instances, the
illusion of it -- remains consistently present.&nbsp;<span style=""></span>Responses remain not only colourful, but
authentic.<span style=""> </span>In my experience the game&#8217;s conversation
mechanic, while simple, does create something truly engaging.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;SPEEDBUMPS<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I did run into speedbumps and you probably will too.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Scenery description shines like the burning
jungle sun, humid and wet with your own uncontrollable sweat; implementation is
sparse.&nbsp;<span style=""></span>There&#8217;s some&#8230;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><s>&gt; Guess-That-Word</s>
<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><s>&gt; Guess Word</s>
<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><s>&gt; Guesswork<o:p></o:p></s></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><s>&gt; Guess work</s>
<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><s>&gt; Guess &#8220;work&#8221;</s></i>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="">&gt; Guess the Verb</i>
in triggering conversational responses at times.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Though I felt frustrated at some points -- and
I&#8217;ll admit, I don&#8217;t often have a long fuse -- the game&#8217;s writing held me in
it.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The unflinching sincerity in the
game&#8217;s representation of Westerners in <st1:place w:st="on">Southeast Asia</st1:place>,
its detailed imagery, and a sense of foreboding, of a mystery to unfold kept me
going.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;CHARACTERIZATION<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="">Love is as Powerful as
Death </i>contextualizes its characters realistically.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>They are the focal points of this game.&nbsp;<span style=""></span>These characters struggle with their values,
previously-held certainties, and even each other in an alienating environment.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>There&#8217;s an existential desperation in all of
them, even if not all of them seem aware of it.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Each is also characterized by unique diction and dilemmas that
complement their characterization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>For his own part, Roger (our protagonist) comes off as an
alienated, analytical guy who wants to do good work, but gets pushed around -- or
aside -- too easily.<span style=""> </span>He obviously resents
this, but can&#8217;t always reassert himself in the manner he would like.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The story&#8217;s diction helps bring a lot of Roger&#8217;s
interior character to light through both little word choices (like when he
attempts to be witty in the opening scene) and in whole passages that deviate
from expected portrayals (like the description of the mausoleum).<span style="">&nbsp;</span>In fact, it&#8217;s largely the whole
characterization of Roger and the way it exposes his rising internal conflict
that made the overall effect of the ending work for me.<span style=""> </span>It gave me chills in a way I don&#8217;t think I
can fully describe just now -- especially not without spoilers.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>&gt;X HAM <st1:place w:st="on">SANDWICH</st1:place><o:p></o:p></b></p>









<p class="MsoNormal">I do remember being a bit bothered by, strange as it may
sound, the description of a ham and cheese sandwich in the game.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>First of all, the name of the item is merely
&#8220;ham sandwich&#8221; and it&#8217;s not until the player actually decides to &gt;X HAM
SANDWICH that we see it is a ham <i style="">and
cheese</i> sandwich.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Such derisive
attention to cheesestuffs surely merits only a <i style="">Cheez Whiz </i>rating for this game, <i style="">if</i> that.<o:p> </o:p>Second, third, and infinitely, there are all kinds of
considerations that could go into a sandwich, after all.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Obviously, what sort of cheese is on it?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Is it cheap, processed, pre-sliced
American?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>A mild Emmentaler?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>A thick, irregular hunk of cheddar hacked off
from a block or wheel?<span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p>Then we get that it has ham &#8220;from the deli in town,&#8221; but
that hardly seems descriptive given the vast potential differences between how
ham&#8212; let alone <i style="">delicatessens</i>&#8212; might
be prepared.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>How thick is the ham?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Is it like from home?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Was the deli open air, swarming with
flies?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>And what kind of bread was it on?<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Personally, I always think of ham &amp;
cheese as being on that sort of soft, white bread that squishes when you grab
it and leaves the indents of your fingerprints.</p>







<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>When I found this isolated, little piece of the Occident [in
a tupperware <i style="">(sic)</i> container, no less]
I considered how a friend&#8217;s mom used to always pack his sandwiches at school
and thought, &#8220;What an interesting juxtaposition.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>What sort of associations might it bring up
for our protagonist?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Only I discovered
that Roger had very little to say about it or its taste for that matter.<o:p> </o:p>I was sorely disappointed at first, but later considered how
lack of detail in some of the more mundane objects featured could serve the
narrative.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Roger is probably not a
sandwich connoisseur, and details like the things we eat can often end up
glossed over in our memories over long periods despite their contextual
importance, especially if something much more memorable, more horrific or
unsettling overshadows them in the telling.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;X MAUSOLEUM<o:p></o:p></b></p>





<p class="MsoNormal">The last part stops all the talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it&#8217;s traditional IF compass-and-picking-up-stuff
style.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>more local stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8230;it made me feel more alone.&nbsp;Conrad Cook <a href="http://onewetsneaker.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/some-notes-from-cambodia-continued/">mentioned
in his blog at one point</a>&nbsp;that it&#8217;s easier to track movement of one expression into another than to
determine the meaning of expressions in isolation&#8212; I wonder if that stands for
gameplay as a method of expression?<i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;ENDING<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Without spoilers, it&#8217;s hard to talk about the ending.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Creepy.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>For a second I thought maybe I&#8217;d missed something -- it felt sort of
sudden and ambiguous -- but it gave me pause -- then vertigo.<span style=""> </span>I swished it over in my brain and gave it
another read.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>It lingers still in my
mind, somehow all-too-real and yet almost like an episode of <i style="">The Twilight Zone</i>&#8230;</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p><b style="">&gt;INTRO<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;This is how later you would remember these events, almost
as if reliving them, going over the details again and again, trying to
recapture the feel of events, putting yourself into them as if they were
happening for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Backup </span>is

the "third backup unit for the Eastern Cascade Facility computer
network," said facility being a sort of receiving and shipping station
for goods and workers in the "Prosperity Commission," an economic
federation of many planets. Normally you are kept offline in reserve,
but you've been woken up now because a group of scruffy granola-eating
rebels have attacked the base, disabling the primary computer systems
and threatening to derail the capitalist dream the facility represents.
You are the last hope for the free market on this world -- if you
choose to be. Yes, Virginia, there is a moral choice to be made in this
one.<br>
<br>
Gameplay&nbsp;is, as Mr. Weir openly acknowledges, very reminiscent
of C.E.J. Pacian's <a href="./spag52.html#mute"><span style="font-style: italic;">Gun Mute</span></a>.
After orienting yourself to your computerized, disembodied
consciousness, you will find that you can take control of a drone robot
equipped with a "plasma sword" that looks suspiciously like a
lightsaber. Indeed, plasma swords are "the only weapons which function
in the facility's weapon dampening field." The meat of the game
consists of a series of progressively tougher combats with the invaders
of the facility, whom you encounter one by one as you work your way
closer to the plasma reactor which they are hard at work destroying and
you are supposed to protect. Cleverly, when one of your drones gets
"killed," you are not killed as well; your consciousness merely returns
to your computer core to manufacture and inhabit another drone. Thus it
is effectively impossible to lose while playing <span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span>. On the
other hand, it's not explained why the invaders remain so passive,
allowing you to send robot after robot against them, and never simply
march into the computer room and pull your plug.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span> is
not a long game at all, and so the ultimate resonance of its moral
decisions is more limited than it might if you had the opportunity to
spend more time with this world and these characters. That said, Weir
handles the moral quandary fairly even-handedly, even if I suspect I
know on which side his sympathies really lie. (Hint: they don't lie
with the corporation.) Is it better to have an economic system with the
maximum individual freedom and the minimum government interference,
allowing those with intelligence and ambition to make truly staggering
amounts of money -- and leaving many other to wallow in poverty? Or is
it better to have a system that regulates (and taxes) things more
tightly, perhaps frustrating the more ambitious and even throttling
innovation to a certain degree but also guaranteeing everyone a certain
minimal standard of living? Or, in short, is economic freedom or
economic equality preferable? These questions are interesting ones for
me in particular, having recently moved from a country that lives by
the former policy to one that lives by the latter.<br>
<br>
For all that, though, I was left a bit disappointed by at least one
aspect of <span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span>.
I was very intrigued by Weir's statement that <span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span> "requires
tactical thought as a challenge rather than puzzle-solving," as I am
very interested in finding ways to build more realistic, fluid
storyworlds for IF. I was therefore disappointed to realize that Weir's
claim is really rather a hollow one. Just as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gun Mute</span>, defeating
each of your opponents in <span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span>
is just a set-piece puzzle, and one that often involves a fair amount
of trial and error and authorial mind-reading at that. An interesting
wrinkle is the ability to defeat opponents violently (killing them) or
relatively nonviolently (just beating them up a bit and knocking them
out), another aspect of the game's moral dimension, but in no way does
this game feel "tactical."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
implemented acceptably if not superbly, and even features a nice little
training section to easy you into the mechanics of using your plasma
sword. As usual from this author, <span style="font-style: italic;">Backup</span>
delivers an enjoyable, well-written experience with a wrinkle or two
that you might not have expected. It's well worth an hour of your time.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ghost Town</span></span>
is not, first of all, a remake of the old Scott Adams game, but rather
an entirely new effort that may just be the first IF game I've ever
played that came from my new home of Denmark. It's also a very
ambitious effort: lengthy, heavily plot-focused, and featuring
occasional music and some nice hand-sketched artwork that suits the
mood quite well. It's in fact among the most ambitious creations I've
ever seen in ADRIFT. But that, of course, is a two-edged sword. After
being thrilled upon installing Windows 7 to learn that it allowed me to
completely uninstall Microsoft's bloated&nbsp;media player, imagine
my delight when the ADRIFT Runner told me I had to reinstall it if I
wanted to hear the game's sounds. Every time I fire up the ADRIFT
Runner it seems to find new ways to confound and annoy me.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The plot of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ghost Town</span>
has you coming into an unexpected inheritance from your long-dead and
heretofore completely unknown great-grandfather, conditional upon your
spending a single night in the deserted old ghost town&nbsp;of
Battle Creek, New Mexico. This doesn't, of course, make a great deal of
sense, but it does afford you a reason to go into Battle Creek and
chase and be chased by things that go bump in the night, as well as
giving you the opportunity to meet a hot lawyer chick, whom you first
see from an angle that pleases you very much.
<p align="center"><img style="width: 699px; height: 309px;" alt="" src="images/ghosttown.png"></p>
Hot chicks are in fact a pretty important part of this game; you'll
meet several more as it continues. While there's nothing wrong with
&nbsp;a bit of harmless escapism, I found something just a bit
creepy about this game's handling of its women. They are so obviously
objectified, so constantly ogled over that I often felt I was learning
more than I really cared to about the author's own fantasies. Doubtless
the reactions of other readers will vary, from feminist outrage to
complete approval. For my own part, I will merely say that the wait for
a truly sexy piece of IF continues.<br>
<br>
The writing is rather haphazard, sometimes&nbsp;contradicting
itself within the same paragraph. X ME, for instance, yields this:<br>
<br>
<samp>Although you actually do know what you look like you decide
to run through your statistics again.<br>
You are male (not a bad thing...) not too bad looking, some women even
think you are handsome.<br>
You stand 6&#180;6&#8221; dark hair which is just slightly longer than a crew cut
which suits you just fine. The dark color goes nicely with your
green/gray eyes and your chiseled chin gives you a determined look that
most women find hard to resist.<br>
You are wearing a pair of well worn jeans which is a little too long so
you have found it necessary to roll them up into cuffs. But hey..
you're an old fashion guy anyway. A plain white T-shirt and a pair of
sneakers complete the picture.<br>
.&nbsp; You are wearing well worn jeans, a pair of sneakers and a
T-shirt.<br><br>

</samp>Do "some women even think I am handsome," or do "most
women find me hard to resist?" There's a fairly wide gulf between these
two statements, after all. And yes, the odd spacing and misplaced
period are in the original. <br>
<br>
And unfortunately the general parser- and storyworld-shoddiness that
marks so many ADRIFT games pokes through in this one as well. You will
often spend time struggling not with the situation in the storyworld
but with the interface. At one point early in the game, for instance,
you're riding shotgun with the hot lawyer chick in her SUV. She tells
you to watch out for a certain small path that should lead to Battle
Creek. I struggled for a long time here, as no longer how long I WAITed
the scenery outside never changed. Finally I realized that the game for
some reason expected me to move the SUV about with compass directions,
even though I wasn't even the one driving.<br>
<br>
It strikes me that this game was implemented as a linear series of
events, and its author never really considered what might happen if the
player did not follow the path set for her. Although four beta-testers
are listed, I at least once found myself stuck and had to restore due
to having completely confused the game with an unexpected action.
Perhaps the testers were playing from the walkthrough?<br>
<br>
It pains me to have to write such a harsh review, because it's quite
plain that much work went into this game. But a lack of final polishing
combined with the general shoddiness of ADRIFT undoes it in the end. A
big game like this
needs to inspire faith in the player -- faith in its fairness, faith in
its implementation,&nbsp;faith in its storyworld modeling, and
faith in its author. This game, alas, does not do that. It's very
difficult to persevere with it for many hours when one is constantly
wondering whether each new problem is a legitimate puzzle, a bug, or
just a game of Parser Fun. In the end, I did what I suspect most of you
would do; I gave up.<br><br>

[It's always interesting to peek at the activities of the non-English
IF communities. Valentine does just that with this capsule review of a
recent CYOA-style game from the Russian URQ community. -JM]<br>
<p><i>- Is that you, daddy?<br>
- Sonny, you better don't touch this sore subject...
</i></p>
<p>
In this short game, which is announced as the first episode of a
serial, you play the youngest son of an Irish farmer. They left you
back to look after the farm and to do chores, while the rest of the
family goes to the fair...
</p>
<p>Brilliant humour (several phrases will linger in my mind for a
long
time) and an astounding dynamism of action somewhat reminiscent of the
late stages of <a href="../s.html#shade"><i>Shade</i></a>
by Andrew Plotkin are this work's main assets.
</p>
<p>Some drawbacks are also present - both stylistic and
programmatic.
They are mostly of "a master's negligence" kind, but the authors
overdid it somewhat.
</p>
<p>Don't be irritated by the shortness of this review - the game
is definitely worth playing... that is, if you can read Russian;).

</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">
My Uncle George</span>
is a simple interactive short story of the modern sort. It has no
puzzles. The game is based upon conversation with the NPC prominently
named in the title. The endgame is soon reached as the player is
confronted with a significant decision to make. The ending text varies
depending on what the player chooses to do.<br><br>The story is pretty
much the same regardless of what ending the player reaches. The fate of
the PC himself is barely affected at all by the outcome. There are
essentially three such outcomes, denoted by messages that can appear
within the standard game-over asterisks. Within the three outcomes,
there is some variation of the ending text, depending on the specific
action that the player had taken.<br><br>This sparing plot is presented
in first person, which allows the player to become more closely
acquainted with the PC's thought processes than second person. The
stream-of-consciousness narrative voice produced by the tense is
integral to the game. In general, I believe second person is better for
interactive fiction, but the style of this work would be lacking if the
author had not used first person. The writing is good enough to make an
impact on the player without being excessively emotional. The exception
to the high quality of the writing is the dialog, which attempts to be
natural and colorful. However, it seems standard for colloquial dialog,
as if it were trying too hard. The main method employed to give the
characters their own voices is frequent use of profanity.<br><br>Like
the writing, the worldbuilding is excellent and well-crafted. The game
world seems much more fully implemented than it actually is. There is
only one room in the game, but the PC can hear things going on in
adjoining locations. The PC and Uncle George are the only characters
that are actually coded, but the player learns about several background
characters not only through dialog, but also by witnessing the direct
results of their actions. In fact, some of these background figures
seem to be better characterized than the one coded NPC. Multiple
sessions, exploring different dialog options, flesh out the PC by
revealing information about his life and family.<br><br>It would be
nice if the conversation system were as well-developed as the
worldbuilding. Unfortunately, dialog is revealed through the use of
only one command, the tried-and-true ASK. Most topics that the NPC can
be asked about produce several lines of interchange between the two
characters, which at least helps the bulk of the gameplay to feel
slightly less like an interrogation. Still, a more detailed approach
with topic suggestions and the TELL command would have been more
interesting and more interactive. I'm not sure if a conversation menu
system would have worked because more than half the game could then
potentially be reduced to selecting menu options, but I think it would
have been better than the minimalist approach taken. Granted, the
simple conversation system is thoroughly implemented in that just about
any topic that reasonably fits the context is recognized. Additionally,
I discovered a few topics that have nothing to do with the story or
setting, but are simply natural things to say in a real conversation.<br><br>The strongest point of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">My Uncle George</span>
is its rich and detailed atmosphere. The genre is everyday
slice-of-life, even if the story is not about a routine event. I prefer
more speculative scenes myself, but the level of detail executed with
the skillful writing was enough to hold my interest. Conversely, the
weakest point is the plot. It is a bit disappointing that the action
taken by the PC in the game has no effect on his fate. The NPC's fate
does hang in the balance to a greater degree, but his character was not
developed enough for the player to sympathize with him much.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">My Uncle George</span> is a worthy little piece of IF, and it makes for an interesting way to spend half an hour.<br><br>

</table></span><br>I quite like Shamus Young. If you aren't familiar
with him, he writes prolifically about videogames and (occasionally)
tabletop RPG's on <a href="http://www.twentysided.com/">his blog</a>, and also draws&nbsp;<a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/stolen-pixels">a biweekly comic</a> for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Escapist</span>.
He brings a perspective that I don't find too often in mainstream
videogame criticism; he's a bit more mature than most, always willing
to say it like it is, and quite frequently genuinely funny. And so I
check in on his blog from time to time, even if some of what I find
there, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=7180">video of a complete playthrough of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mass Effect</span></a>,
strikes me as about as interesting as reading the phonebook. I particularly appreciate his tireless advocacy for better
storytelling in mainstream videogames, and his willingness to call out
even critical darlings like, yes, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=7004">the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mass Effect</span> series</a>
for their failings in this area. I was immediately interested when I
learned that Mr. Young had created a new IF game, not only because he
has quite an Internet following and thus might introduce IF to some
newcomers, but also because I was genuinely curious to see what he
would come up with.<br><br>The game is, as the title would imply, a
satire of pretty much every FPS game of the last ten years.
Ridiculously over-the-top opening cinematic, cardboard action movie
characters, ultra-violent gameplay, and even the occasional sound or
graphics glitch... it's all here. FPS conventions are&nbsp;skewered with a
keen eye. The response to your taking one of the medkits you find
incongruously lying about is typical:<br><br><samp>You tear open the MedKit and immediately use everything inside at once.&nbsp; Why save any for later, right?</samp><br><br>Unfortunately,
many of the bugs you'll encounter do not exist in the game being satired
but rather in the text adventure doing the satiring. And incongruous
responses and unimplemented scenery abound. To be fair, Mr. Young
clearly said when he posted the game on his blog that it wasn't done --
literally. There is no ending; you merely come to a point where there
is just nowhere else to go. <br><br>Whether
he ever finishes it or
not, this is of course a slight work, and if you are blissfully unaware
of the genre being satirized you will likely find it baffling. If
you've played your share of FPS games,&nbsp;though, or even watched
someone else playing,&nbsp;you might find it worthy of a laugh or
two even in its current rather dishevelled state.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">

</span>&nbsp;<br>Textfyre's first commercial IF release, <span style="font-style: italic;">Jack Toresal and the Secret Letter</span>,
was an underwhelming experience for most who played it, or even those
like me who just played the demo. Not only was it hampered by an
unwieldy and bloated Silverlight-based interpreter, but it seemed to
have lost its soul somewhere along the way of striving to appeal to a
market-researched young adult demographic. It therefore makes me doubly
happy to be able to say that Textfyre's second release, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shadow in the Cathedral</span>,
does not suffer from the same problems. First of all, you can download
and run it in your interpreter of choice as a good old Glulx story
file. But more significantly, it's a solid, occasionally spectacular piece of plot-focused IF,
featuring a well-imagined storyworld, an interesting story, and some
crackerjack writing.<br><br>The world of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cathedral</span>
is at bottom Victorian steam-punk, hardly a setting that has been
lacking in fantasy fiction of the last twenty years. It's painted
vividly, however, and embellished with some original details, the most
obvious of these being the society's obsession with clocks, to the
extent that the eponymous cathedral exists essentially to provide a
scaffolding for and a place to worship the Cathedral Clock, which hangs
"large as the setting sun" in its dome. You play Wren, a young orphan
who was taken in by the nearby abbey to serve as a "2nd Assistant Clock
Polisher." Shortly after play begins, you witness something you really
shouldn't have, and then it's off to the races to foul a Dastardly Plot
that reaches right to the top of the church hierarchy. Things don't
slow down much at all for the next six to eight hours; the plot just
keeps rushing you breathlessly along. You may well feel as out of
breath as Wren by the time you get to the end.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cathedral</span>'s<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>plot
is essentially a linear series of events, affording the player little
to no opportunity to reshape things to her liking. The danger of this
type of construction, especially when it is as frenetically paced as it
is here, is that the player can feel like a sort of football, kicked
from one NPC to another and given granular tasks to solve but no say in
the big picture; a role more typical of a corporate middle manager
than&nbsp;the hero in a&nbsp;work of&nbsp;fiction. And to be sure, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cathedral </span>does
suffer from this to some extent. It is always either Wren (voicing his
thoughts to the player) or (more often) the NPC's, whether villains or
heroes, who have the Big Ideas that send the player scurrying about,
reacting but never really acting. But&nbsp;I know from experience that
creating heavily plotted IF is difficult, especially in a larger scale
work such as this one. The strengths of the rest of the game were
enough to let me easily overlook this aspect of it, even if I do hope
for a bit more design ambition for the next game in the series.<br><br>Chief
among those strengths is the writing, which is done in first person and
has the sort of wide eyed "gee whiz" quality one might expect from its
genre, but nevertheless feels thoroughly natural, never coming across
as a man struggling to write down to children. A lovely touch are all
the clock-related puns and exclamations Wren and others indulge in,
such as "Clockwise!" and "Skip a tooth!" Such things really bring the
storyworld to life, as does the fairly well worked-out philosophical
basis of the game's society, which posits that clocks and other
mechanical creations are fundamentally superior to nature. (Exactly the
opposite of our own culture, with its cult of the natural and organic.)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cathedral </span>is
quite a lengthy game by modern standards, and the amount of actual
content it offers is even more considerable, for you will not spend a
substantial portion of your hours with this one wrestling with puzzles,
as you might in old school epics like <a href="../c.html#curses"><span style="font-style: italic;">Curses</span></a> or Ingold's own <a href="../m.html#muldoon"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Muldoon Legacy</span></a>.
There is rather always something new happening, always fresh text to
read. It doesn't place too many demands on its player, with the result
that it feels oddly like a more casual version of conventional IF even
as its length distinguishes it from the more common snack-sized games
of today. I actually would have liked to have been allowed to spend a
bit more time just poking around and exploring some of the crannies of
its world,&nbsp;but there always seemed to be another crisis to deal
with. I also wouldn't have minded some more intricate puzzles, puzzles
for which its storyworld certainly had the potential, but in the end I
will always take puzzles that are too easy over puzzles that are too
hard.<br><br>Of course, Textfyre&nbsp;expects money for this game --
$9.95 US to be precise. In that light, the smattering of bugs and
inappropriate responses that I encountered stick out a bit more.
Ironically, I suspect the testing process was complicated by this being
a commercial product, with the (presumed) requisite need for NDA's and
the like. Regardless, and while it's not a disaster by any means, the
game perhaps have used a few more than its five listed testers.
Likewise, it's bare-bones presentation, featuring no illustrations or
other embellishments whatsoever, seems problematic for Textfyre's
stated goal of drawing its customers primarily from those unfamiliar
with the joys of textual IF. (Ironically, in this area it has the opposite problem from that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Secret Letter</span>, which looked like the victim of an explosion in the interpreter factory.)<br><br>But the big question for those of us who already know about the joys of a screenful of text and blinking command prompt is, is <span style="font-style: italic;">Shadow in the Cathedral</span>
worth spending money on in light of the huge variety of free IF
available today? Well, it's certainly not a technological or artistic
game-changer, but it is a thorough compilation of current IF
design wisdom placed at the service of a richly intriguing plot and
setting; exactly the sort of work, in other words, that should be
happening in IF now that the endless formal experiments of the late
1990's and early 2000's have pretty much exhausted themselves. I have
my doubts about many of Textfyre's approaches,
but I certainly don't regret spending $10 on this product. If you
believe as I do that good work is worth paying for, I don't think
you'll be disappointed after purchasing <span style="font-style: italic;">Shadow in the Cathedral</span>.<br><br>&nbsp;<a href="#Contents">Back to

</table></span><br>In the <a href="./spag55.html#Editorial">editorial for the SPAG issue # 55</a>,
Jimmy Maher told about his IF-authoring experience, and wrote, among other things, these phrases: <br><p><i>I now wonder if there might be a better way, a way to simplify the job of the IF author... 
I am even considering... whether putting some constraints on the player's interactions would really be such a bad thing.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, most members of <a href="./spag48.html">the Russian IF Community</a> know the answer: menu-based games! (Or, to
use a more habitual term, CYOA). And yes, in spite of being developed with a parser-oriented platform, <i>Walker and Silhouette</i> clearly is menu-based.
</p>
<p>The player advances the story by clicking her/his way through what
the game author calls "keywords" - highlighted object and/or action
references in the descriptions displayed. (Alternatively, the object
names can be typed at the prompt, but it's really not worth bothering.)
This approach works fairly well (that is, if you don't have a deep
abhorrence of menu-based adventures). I'd probably even go a step
further than the author did, and would remove the last parser rudiments
that neither are needed to finish the story nor add anything in terms
of entertainment value. In fact, the few "traditional" commands not
fitting the overall game paradigm that remained in the game are likely
mimesis breaker if the player decides to use them for some reason. (I
didn't test this aspect of the game thoroughly, but for instance
attempts to <i>talk</i>
to a character resulted in inappropriate responses several times). On
the other hand, there's been at least one moment when I felt the game
insisted on its menu-based nature too much. It was sort of a riddle,
for which I knew the correct answer, but just typing it in at the
prompt didn't work, and my protagonist and I had to (uselessly) spend
several turns guessing.
</p>
<p>If a bit more technical criticism is allowed, I'd complain about
some (pretty many, in fact) responses to keywords remaining unchanged
on successive clicks, and the player characters not disposing of some
items in their inventory in time (which, again, leads to mimesis breaks
when these items are referenced to later in the game). However, all
these issues are rather minor.
</p>
<p>The story is about the police detective Nate Walker and the former
dissident Ivy Blissheart joining together to investigate a murder.
Several little details - e. g., the game being structured in
chapter-like segments, circular bruises all over the victim's body,
visiting the Asylum, tentacled monsters, and the cane carried by one of
the PCs - reminded me of another work, namely, <a href="./spag56.html#king"><i>The King of Shreds and Patches</i></a>. I can't tell whether it was gentle 
parodying, an influence the author of <i>W&amp;S</i> remained unaware of, or just pure coincidence. One thing is sure, however - it's not plagiarism, since in 
every other respect, <i>Walker and Silhouette</i> is entirely different. It's lighthearted, it's loaded with great humour. The writing is brilliant. As you 
might have guessed from the previous lines of this review, the PCs are switched in the course of the game. <i>W&amp;S</i> certainly isn't the first work to do 
that sort of thing, but it still uses this device quite effective. Literacy is an aspect where <i>Walker and Silhouette</i> succeeds unreservedly.
</p>
<p>The puzzles are mostly on the easy side (which is not surprising for
a menu-based game), but satisfying to solve nevertheless. The only
exception probably is the final fight, which demonstrated how difficult
it sometimes is to keep a puzzle fair and realistic at the same time.
The author clearly opted for fairness here; on the other hand, he used
this opportunity to insert a couple more of his hilarious jokes, so
that in the end, I didn't mind. For those who prefer <i>reading</i> the story rather than <i>playing</i> it, there's a clever hint system (activated by the current player character 
thinking).
</p>
<p>I liked <i>Walker and Silhouette</i> a lot. Sure, that's partly
because I prefer humorous games in general; however, I also felt it's
somewhat deeper than just comedy. But I'd better stop expatiating about
it now, since it'd be just spoiling the fun for the reader.
