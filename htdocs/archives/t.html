[Note: In the original version of Neil's review, the game's title was
maintained in strict lower case -- "t-zero" -- after the game's own
fashion of referring to itself. I've changed the case for the sake of
readability only. --Paul]

NAME: T-Zero
AUTHOR: Dennis Cunningham
DATE: 1991
PARSER: Custom
SUPPORTS: PC
AVAILABILITY: Shareware ($20)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/pc/t-zero.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/pc/t-zero.zip</a>
VERSION: 1.04

T-Zero is an anomaly of IF. Released in 1991, after the heady Infocom
days but before Inform and the renaissance of IF, T-Zero is a
surprisingly modern game. Dennis Cunningham's puzzle-based work evokes a
rich atmosphere in a land familiar and yet unknown.

Cunningham sees himself as a programmer with literary leanings and -- on
the evidence here -- succeeds in both. T-Zero runs as a stand-alone DOS
game, released in full as shareware.

"An Adventure for the Time Being", the subtitle, sums up the story.
T-Zero is an adventure game. A literate, immersive piece of IF, but
foremost an adventure game. The player-character must locate six objects
"scattered across ages and landscapes", objects which are to be
transported "somehow...to progressively future time zones where they can
right the troubled times." Echoes of other games, such as Level 9's
Lords of Time, and premonitions of Nelson's seminal <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses</a> and <a href = "j.html#jigsaw">Jigsaw</a>.
(Cunningham had hoped to quote extensively from T.S. Eliot -- compare
Jigsaw -- but permission was not granted.)

As the subtitle also suggests, time is the motif running through the
game. Time and words, although there is much more going on than
chronological word-play. A typical example is this extract from the
opening:

   It's just as well that you were dismissed from the museum--your
   duties as combination custodian and librarian involved either
   re-shelving books and dusting off clocks or rewinding timepieces and
   dusting off books. However, you were onto something.

An ex-libris librarian, then, the PC has an account to straighten with
the mysterious owner of the museum (a museum devoted to time,
naturally), Count Zero. Just what the Count is up to, and how the
troubled times might be righted, is pieced together as the game
progresses.

As the game opens, the status-line, in addition to the usual location
and score, reads "6:00AM * Day 1 * Present"; there is a strange compass
in the initial inventory. It is clear that the PC could be visiting time
zones other than the Present. Indeed, once inside the museum, there is
time for the Past, Present and Future...and beyond.

While T-Zero is not overly large, much more exploration is required than
in other games of a similar size. Time is realistically modelled (how
could it be otherwise?); each move takes five minutes of game time. The
world reflects the current time: the sun rises and sets, hours are
chimed, and so on. Exploration is also necessary since some objects do
not appear at once and some actions must be performed at the right time
-- although precise move-counting is uncommon.

The writing is strong, often thematic. Responses defy the conventional,
sometimes cheerfully breaking mimesis, but always seem appropriate (try
'g' or 'turn'-ing a fixed object). A favourite is the response to a word
not understood by the parser, "That word comes from an unknown realm."
Cunningham is not afraid to impose his eclectic world upon the player
and the effect can be entrancing:

   Moebius Strip.    
   The racing strip here twists in on itself to form a continuous band
   without inside or out. Contenders, defying gravity, adhere to the
   track whether right-side up or upside down.

   There are a tortoise and a hare here. The hare is running moebius
   strips around the tortoise which assuredly continues with measured
   progress.

   > get hare
   You miss by a hare's breadth.

T-Zero is impressive technically, particularly considering that it was
written without the aid of an authoring system. Unlike some stand-alone
games, the parser is well up to Infocom standard, handling full
sentences and even genuine adjectives without a murmur. Cunningham
appears to have implemented an object system of sorts: the parser knows
that poppies and marigolds are both types of flowers, for instance.

Most interesting are the meta verbs that become available later in the
game: 'find', 'where', 'copy' and 'imagine', the latter which "allows
[the] player to 'visualise' unencountered objects or locations."

The parser does not pretend to understand more than it does -- which is
commendable -- but can lack synonyms and, if rarely, lack objects
mentioned in the room descriptions, which is less commendable. It can
become confused between verbs and nouns, for instance with 'lever' and
'plant', and plural objects must be referred to as 'it', not 'them'.

Version 1.04 of T-Zero is available on the IF archive. The interface has
all the conveniences expected: command history, scripting, customisable
colours. Function keys are programmable, the arrow keys can be used to
enter directions, standard short-cuts (except 'z') and undo all work.
Cunningham has added some neat touches, too, like an inline menu for
disambiguation and selection, and careful use of colour.

The puzzles, on the whole, are not hard in themselves provided the
language, time or popular culture references are familiar; the game has
built-in context-dependent hints. However, a certain amount of waiting
around and verbal dexterity is required, and I found the insight for
some of the puzzles slow in coming. When the insight comes, the
consequences can be delightful. There is a well-signposted maze early in
the game, one which exhibits Lewis Carroll-like qualities.

On occasion, I was reminded that the game does not neatly sit in the
Infocom tradition. Exits, to take one example, are not consistently
listed in room descriptions because an 'exits' verb is provided instead.
The descriptions thus seem more natural and concise, at the cost of the
repeated use of 'exits' when first exploring. Increases to the score, to
take another example, are signalled as default by a small tune, not by a
textual message (although of course the status-line changes).

There are three main criticisms that can be brought against T-Zero. The
first is that the expectations of contemporary IF have shifted from
those of the early 1990s. Death, for instance, can occur instantly
without warning in the most unexpected ways. While UNDO will remedy the
situation, such happenings only irritate. Similarly, some puzzles (to my
mind) assume too many Americanisms. And finishing with full points is
harder than it ought to be. The player has a Bill of Rights, remember?

The second criticism is that sometimes Cunningham's world is too
detailed. The PC has a limited carrying capacity, as do all the
containers to be found. Objects in or on another object are tediously
listed (sand in an egg timer, for instance). The world seems rounded and
understanding -- but too easily the parser is seen to be lacking real
knowledge. None of these things is wrong by itself but their cumulative
effect can become tedious.

Finally, on occasion, Cunningham over-reaches himself. While not quite
guess-the-verb, the syntax to perform a desired action can be elusive: I
found the moebius strip infernally demanding, for example. While often
delightful, the linguistic ingenuity can be frustrating and the parser
trying (no more trying than Inform or TADS, it should be added). When it
works, however, the game works splendidly.

It's unclear whether the author is still accepting registration for
T-Zero. Various email addresses are given in the documentation, but a
search of the web reveals no homepage. Other shareware IF from the time
-- see the review of <a href = "h.html#humbug">Humbug</a> in SPAG #11 [or, indeed, in this very issue!
--PO] -- has now passed into the public domain.

T-Zero is an anomaly. Although not to the liking of everyone, definitely
recommended: it is, arguably, a piece of modern IF before the modern
era, so always lacking the full attention it deserves. An unusual game,
unwittingly reflecting its unusual place in the history of IF.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag24.html">SPAG #24</a> -- March 24, 2001

One day, about 10 years ago I found myself ready to give up on my amber
colored IBM XT. Maybe it was the flicker of a screen too old to be any
good, or the speed of a processor so slow that words didn't appear until
10 seconds after I was finished typing, but I'd finally had enough and
was getting ready to get rid of the old hunk of junk.

My real lament was that outside of some word processing and spreadsheet
programs, there was really nothing I could do with my old XT. So, I
explained my dilemma to a programming buddy and asked for a little help.
He promised he would download a few games for me off a local BBS and
when the disk finally arrived it turned out to be only one game and
something called a "text adventure" to boot.

Now I was sort of familiar with text adventure games, as I had played
the <a href = "z.html#zorktril">Zork trilogy</a> way back in the early 80s, but what I was unaware of
was that the quality for most shareware games produced during the early
nineties was very low (relative to today, at least). It was a stroke of
fortune then, that my friend downloaded for me the competently created
T-Zero.

T-Zero chronicles the bizarre plight of a recently fired and evicted
Museum custodian who is charged with figuring out what his former
employer and game antagonist Count Zero is up to. The story starts off
with you waking from uneasy dreams with the realization that you were
onto something incriminating about the Count just before he fired you.
The bulk of the game then revolves around you trying to get back into
the museum to rediscover what exactly it was that you'd latched on to.
It's a simple premise to get started on that eventually turns complex,
with bit players galore, conspiracies, plans for anti-utopic world
domination, and time travel to a past and future world vastly different
from the one you started out in. Confused yet? Well there's more afoot
here than a simple time travel game where the same room's locations
change to reflect your temporal journeys. The plot goes from the
mundane, to the prehistoric, to an Orwellian nightmare with landscapes
that are as evocative as <a href = "s.html#sofar">So Far</a>'s surreal worlds but held together more
succinctly, with the common thread of slightly familiar settings that
change notably over different time periods. Here for example, is a
sketch of a sawmill described in the present, past and future: 

Present:

   Abandoned Mill
   Yellow dew-drenched mushrooms pop through the scattered timbers and
   redwood sawdust that mark the site of an abandoned mill.

Past:

   Sawmill
   You've lumbered onto a mill with a conveyor belt that lazily leads
   under whirring sawteeth.

   Since all the forests you've encountered in this era have been
   characterized by immature growth, you vaguely wonder about the
   purpose of the mill.

Future:

   Gristmill
   Although nothing is being ground here, a host of befuddled joggers
   relentlessly power a series of studded treadmills. Their emaciated
   bodies suggest that they are attempting something more than mere
   exercise.

That's some pretty awesome prose in my opinion. The beauty of
Cunningham's writing style is that it's so economical, with nary a word
wasted. His room descriptions give the reader enough information to
accurately describe the setting and mood, while leaving a good part of
the surrounding scenery to the reader's imagination. The only criticism
about these beautifully rendered scenes is that Cunningham seldom if
ever puts in exit descriptions. I've always found that writing exit
descriptions tends to break up the flow of a room description, and
certainly, one of the reasons I think I enjoyed T-Zero's prose as much
as I did was because of the lack of phrases like "There are exits
leading east, north, and southwest," tacked on to the end of each
paragraph. Having said that though, take a look again at the text in the
preceding sawmill description. Do you have any idea how to exit this
location? Yeah, me neither. One of the real drawbacks of T-Zero is that
you'll probably have to try all 8 cardinal directions upon entering each
new room (until you become more comfortable with landscape), and that
can be a real pain; especially in a day-and-age where we would expect
exits to appear in every room description. A small quibble however, and
it does very little to detract from this game.

The prose was also particularly good when it came to NPC dialogue. The
NPCs by-and-large tend to be pretty one dimensional in terms of their
conversation. More often than not you'll get responses like,
"<character> is too preoccupied at the moment." when you ask a question.
But when you find a conversation topic that the character has something
to say about, the responses are typically witty and reflective of the
absurd nature of the NPC and the game's surroundings. Here's an example:

   > Ask Prufrock about Count Zero
   "My former Prince seems to be intent upon squeezing the universe into
   a ball and rolling it towards the future without regard to who's
   flattened in the process. I'd like to see his head, grown slightly
   bald, brought in upon a platter."

What's more, the principal NPCs, like many of the game's items, are
"reusable", which is to say that you need to utilize their skills on an
ongoing basis at different points in the game.

The fabulous prose also fleshes out what is in essence a big
house-o-puzzles-type game, making the substantial differences between
the game's diverse surroundings seem, well... almost seamless. The puzzles
themselves are genuinely hard. Not many of them are unfair, but there
are 3 or 4 incredibly obscure puzzles, that will probably irritate you
to no end. One of them revolves around a <a href = "n.html#nord">Nord-and-Bert</a>-style
turn of phrase, a culturally biased colloquialism; another two involve
some extremely suspect lateral thinking; and finally there's an
ultra-obscure puzzle centering on a reference to a Beatles song that I
didn't get until I saw Oasis do a cover version a few years back. By and
large however, the puzzles are well done and integrate effectively with
the story. All the puzzles are clued (Hmmm... I won't say well-clued,
because not many of the solutions are exceedingly obvious) in one way or
another, with a huge emphasis placed on the way object, dialogue and room
description text is worded for some of the tougher puzzles. In fact,
word association may be a good exercise when you find yourself stumped.
Among the more standard-type puzzles there are some interesting spins,
with perhaps the most novel maze I've ever seen (It's actually a
pleasure to map out once you find the key), the most original key I've
ever encountered, and some great lateral puzzles that involve actions in
one time period affecting the landscape of another.

The game's objects are also many, varied, and interesting. Some of the
more notable ones include items that enable you to look at your
surroundings as they're presented in the future and in the past, which
results in a few hilarious descriptions like this one: "It's a good
thing you're merely looking into the past because if you were actually
present, you would be impaled on the sharp point of a... etc.", and
objects that speed up, distort, and even reverse the flow of time (the
status line in this game takes one heck of a beating!). There's also a
huge amount of reusability with the game's items with an adventurer's
backpack full of many, apparently single-use, items that can be
transformed or broken apart to form other important items. If that isn't
enough, still other items have interesting mechanics or physics all
there own, and I often found the experimentation process with these
items to be as much fun as solving some of the more satisfying puzzles.

So, to wrap up: T-Zero is a well-crafted game in almost every sense. In
fact, considering the production date of this game (way back in 1991), I
was surprised to find how easily I felt it could rival some of today's
better games in terms of story, puzzles, and game design. Now, that's
not to say that it doesn't suffer from typical problems associated with
shareware games of that era, because at times, it most certainly does.
I've already mentioned the problems with listing exits in room
descriptions and one-dimensional NPCs, but there are also problems with
the parser handling very few synonyms, and the parser demanding exact
and complex syntax for what should be very easy commands. The game
unfortunately can also be put into an unwinnable state in many
situations without player notification, and I can't begin to imagine how
frustrating it would be for a player to make it all the way to the
game's end only to realize that something crucial was rendered
unattainable near the game's beginning. Still, there are more than
enough user-friendly player aids to make up for these shortcomings. As
the game progresses, new verbs may become available to you such as
"WHERE" (a command which lists the last place you left an object once in
your possession) and "FIND" (a command reminiscent of the "GOTO" verb
from Irene Callaci's <a href = "d.html#danger">Dangerous Curves</a>, that effectively puts the parser
on autopilot until you've reached the destination you just typed in.)
Similarly, the parser is extremely helpful in pointing out where it
didn't understand your message, with menus to help choose between
ambiguous objects and arrows pointing out the parser's problems with
your commands. Here are a few examples:

   > Get go
     ^   ^
   Please one action at a time

   > Get xyzzy
         ^
   That word comes from an unknown realm.

   > Drop book
   You possess more than one of those. Please choose between them:
      > Scarlet book.
      > Tan book.
      > None.

All this, and with a parser that appears to be home-brewed to boot! Wow!

All I can say is I was lucky that T-Zero was the first shareware
text-game I played. T-Zero spoiled me, with its nifty puzzles, beautiful
story, and delicate prose, and in a way I've been looking for that same
playing experience ever since (and, I've of course found it on occasion
:). You can imagine my chagrin when a few years later, I found the IF
Archive and began playing the easily executable crop of AGT games, and
found them nowhere near as entertaining, challenging, or playable. On
that fateful day when my friend downloaded T-Zero, imagine what path my
life may have taken had he instead given me a copy of <a href = "s.html#cardigan">Space Aliens
Laughed at My Cardigan</a>. I'd probably be homeless and penniless on the
street as I write this!

VERSION: Release 1 (SmoochieComp original)

Oh this is sweet -- a delightful little story of a night of adventure.

You play a mysterious secretive character who steals kisses from women
caught unaware. The whole game is like this. Well, most of it. Really.
Go play it if you have 5 minutes to spare. The game is as compact as it
is amusing.

The light-hearted mood is sustained by excellently conceived prose
heavily peppered with overt prompting to move the player along. I found
myself using verbs I would never think to use in any other game. There
are no puzzles to speak of and the story is very much on rails after the
first few rooms. It never ceases to amaze me what can be accomplished
with such sparse geometry, objects, and NPC interaction -- a sign of
very effective writing.

And lastly, if you haven't done so already, play through "<a href = "s.html#shade">Shade</a>" (Zarf's
Comp 2000 entry) prior to this one for maximum effect. That should quiet
any feelings of missing out that those who're not ifmud regulars may
have.

VERSION: Version 1.0

This is the first one I played (if that makes a difference).

I loved the writing in &quot;Tapestry,&quot; particularly the purgatorial prologue
scenes.  Vivid and absorbing, the prose makes you feel, which is rare
for I-F.  The author of this game seems to have put the most effort into
his writing of any of the Inform entries, as indicated by the fact that
it's both the longest Inform entry and one of the shortest actual games.

The depth comes from the &quot;fiction&quot; aspect, not the &quot;interactive&quot; aspect.
All the interactive scenes are short and small and offer relatively
little room for experimentation, since the major choices you must make
are limited to one of two paths.  Still, I'm a sucker for multiple
endings.

Most surprising to me: Neither of the paths is decidedly &quot;better&quot; than
the other.  Doing what the web-weavers say changes nothing, but gives
Timothy an impression of strength and willingness to accept what has
been done.  Doing what Morningstar says is right always ends in someone
else's tragedy.  Yet the insightful, non-judgmental epilogue makes
either choice feel proper in the grand scheme of events, adding depth to
the otherwise simplistic plot.

All in all, a nicely polished entry, with imaginative characters, and
a story that could do with perhaps a bit more overall interactivity.
Daniel Ravipinto is either a new author to watch closely, or a
pseudonym, and if he's the latter I'm dying to know his true identity.

PLOT: Simple but effective (1.3)         ATMOSPHERE: Not much (1.3)
WRITING: Quite good (1.5)          GAMEPLAY: A bit clunky (1.1)
CHARACTERS: Sketchy (1.1)          PUZZLES: Few (0.8)
MISC: Ambitious, not wholly successful but interesting (1.8)
OVERALL: 7.0

Daniel Ravipinto's Tapestry is the sort of game that can really only
be done once: any imitation would lose the impact that the original
had. It tries to do something, moreover, that very little IF tries to
do--defend a position--and if the overall experience isn't entirely
successful, the player should at least recognize the novelty of the
ground it's breaking.  Though less a game than a philosophical
position, Tapestry does what it sets out to do reasonably well; it
didn't, however, make a persuasive argument as far as I was concerned.

The basic idea is relatively simple: you play a man named Timothy
Hunter who has died, who meets one certain personage offering a choice
and then three others who offer two more choices, distinctly
contrasting, and who is given the option to replay key scenes from his
life and reconsider certain moments. The choices--you discover this
immediately, so I don't feel that I'm giving much away--include your
decision to attend a key meeting to help a client when your mother was
dying, your decision to kill your wife when she was suffering from a
painful disease, and your failure--it's hard to construe it as a
decision--to avoid a pedestrian in the car accident that ended your
life. You are given three choices; I won't spell them out, but they
hinge on changing the events as opposed to changing what you make of
them.

It may fairly be said that the game element of Tapestry isn't
extensive; there aren't really any puzzles, and what there are, I'm
afraid, mostly derive from choosing syntax or figuring out fairly
specific responses that the game demands. There's one moment in the
second scene where I knew perfectly well what I wanted to do but
couldn't figure out the precise wording, and the hint menu didn't
help. In that respect, Tapestry might work better as straight fiction
than as IF: giving the story its own pace, rather than tying its
advancement to figuring out actions, might have made it more
powerful. (Though the game is technically proficient in several
respects--the hint menu adapts to your situation quite skillfully, for
one thing, and the situation changes to block off certain paths in
subtle but effective ways.) At any rate, the game element is good
enough to tell the story/make the argument, which is all that's really
needed.

The nature of the paths you're given and of the way the game treats
them makes it reasonably clear that there's a &quot;right&quot; way, and two
&quot;wrong&quot; ways, to go about this; the game locks you into your path once
the choice is made, and the eventual consequences and the terms in
which the games sums up your decisions at the end leaves little doubt
about that. While I don't dispute the logic or philosophical force of
locking you onto your trajectory, on the game's terms, it does limit
the realism element somewhat; in theory, you might have learned from
one experience and want to take a different sort of path at the next
decision point. At the very least, having to play through the thing
when your decisions are foreordained--when the game is simply waiting
for you to input the correct things, not giving you choices as
such--is a bit frustrating; I'm not really sure whether it would have
been better to let it all scroll by than to provide the illusion of
interactivity. It also limits the realism of it all somewhat to
suppose that, if certain key life decisions were changed (and these
are about as key as they get), everything that follows would have
turned out the same, or sufficiently so that your decisions aren't
changed. Even if the game is more an argument than a real-life
depiction, these things affect the persuasiveness of the argument;
when the author is both setting a somewhat contrived scene and staking
out a position that depends on it, it feels like he's stacking the
deck.

I bring all this up because, on the terms that the game presents them,
one can't really argue with the &quot;right&quot; choice; the others are laden
with awful consequences and negative adjectives. But it's not clear at
all to me that this is a fair depiction of the choices; at the very
least, I think I could rewrite key moments of the game without
changing the basic plot or structure to make either of the other two
plots the preferable one. The game didn't, in short, convince me that
my choice was actually justifiable or correct, merely that the author
wanted me to know that he believed it was. That's interesting, in its
way, but not very persuasive.

My main problem with Tapestry, in short is one that I can't really
blame the author for, as such, but it impeded my enjoyment of it
regardless: there was no path that actually reflected what I, speaking
for myself, wanted to do. I should probably say that I'm a
moderate-to-conservative Christian with very definite ideas about what
would or wouldn't imperil the state of one's soul, and it's not at all
the author's fault if the game's outlook leaves me a little cold. That
said, though, I found a certain incoherence in Tapestry; the ending
struck me as so nihilistic that nothing that came before really seemed
to matter much. I can't really explain without spoilers, but suffice
it to say that all the endings seem agnostic--if not outright
atheist--about the protagonist's ultimate fate, which made all of the
foregoing feel a little hollow. Put another way, the game stacks the
deck again, by making it seem as if everything depends on your
decisions but not actually giving you much difference in the
resolution. The author is, of course, free to say all this, but
implicit in the nature of the argument is that the player has to
swallow the author's entire worldview, not simply look at the validity
of what he's saying. And as I resisted accepting the author's
assumptions, the story didn't work very well for me.

Tapestry did, I must admit, make me think about the situation it
presented; it was hard for me to give a clear answer regarding what
I'd do (besides &quot;not do the things in the first place&quot;) because it's
such a bizarre situation and because the terms aren't spelled out very
clearly.  Am I actually reliving my life? If not (as noted above) how
could it be that I can change parts of it and not change the whole
thing? There are Christian arguments for all of the positions, but I
found that the weakest ones were for the path that the author clearly
preferred, which struck me as interesting. It could fairly be argued
that I should have seen where things were going from the beginning and
qualified my objections, and I did have a sense from the first quote
and from the identity (which I did get, along with the <a href = "#trinity">Trinity</a>
reference) of the first NPC. But I still think there's an incoherence
in setting the one figure against the other three, since they come out
of specific traditions that presuppose specific things, and putting
them together just never feels like it makes a lot of sense. More
accurately, I don't think the first character really belongs in the
game, at least not in the role he inhabits; the author is free to
rethink the real nature of that person, of course, but the rethinking
isn't well enough developed for me to buy it. I don't, in other words,
think that the presence of that specific character makes any sense
outside a certain context; it may be a product of my biases, but those
specific biases are not uncommon in the world.

Despite my differences with it, though, I must grant that Tapestry is
a well-written and, mostly, well-crafted work, with plenty of thought
behind it. Whether or not I agree with the views expressed in
Tapestry, I look forward to future works by Mr. Ravipinto.

Of the 1997 competition entries, among the most memorable, and the
most ambitious, is Graham Nelson's &quot;The Tempest&quot; -- but it may also be
the hardest to rate. Certainly, the extensiveness of the Inform
hacking is impressive, and the sheer concept of adapting a drama and
making it interactive is novel -- but the game does not, in truth,
meet all the challenges the task presented.

For the few who don't know: this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's
&quot;The Tempest.&quot; Your role is that of Ariel, the fairy servant to
Prospero, the protagonist of the play, and you must complete a series
of missions given you by Prospero to (a) move the plot along and (b)
win your freedom. The text of the play is virtually all there within
the game, and, essentially, when you do something right, the play
moves along; you're given a series of situations within the play where
the action stops, in a sense, and you need to do something to restart
it. After the first scene, you can never make the game unwinnable; you
can take as long as you like to hit upon the right thing to do to move
things along, and no one will complain. The responses to your actions
are written entirely in Elizabethan, perhaps the best part of the
whole thing for me; an unrecognized verb elicits &quot;That instruction,
that verb, doth elude me,&quot; and &quot;get violets&quot; brings this response: &quot;I
pluck me nodding violets from this darling bed.&quot; Swearing will yield a
rich variety of insults, including this: &quot;Mind thy tongue, thou
paunchy pottle-deep plume- plucked strumpet!&quot; There is, in short, wit
aplenty.

There are also, however, some serious problems. Your required actions
are not always obvious, even with a copy of the play in hand, and
there is no walkthrough or hint system to help you along. Though there
are very few puzzles as such -- though one, requiring that you unlock
a cabinet, is rather confusing and frustrating -- simply figuring out
how to do whatever Prospero has commanded often takes considerable
guesswork. Limiting the difficulty somewhat, though hardly in a
positive way, is the small set of commands that the game recognizes;
once the player figures out the 10 or 15 actions that are helpful, the
experimentation required for any given problem is reduced
somewhat. The problem remains, though; a bottleneck at the very
beginning, in the form of actions that require some intuition even for
those who know the play, makes the difficulty of the whole enterprise
obvious. Other problems abound -- at one point, even though you can
fly, you are required to swim, not an obvious turn of events. The one
significant puzzle requires such trial and error that it breaks the
spell, so to speak, in that the other characters involved never
comment on your presence. And translating some of your tasks into
interactive-fiction actions sometimes results in some strange
creations, notably three homonculi that you carry around.

Nelson takes considerable care to make this a performance of the play,
not an innovation on it. Most obviously, you are prevented from
speaking your own words -- you cannot ASK a character about anything
-- though Ariel will speak lines at the appropriate time,
independently of you. This isn't generally a problem -- it would
confuse things if you tried to interact with most of the characters
anyway -- but given that there are scenes and actions added that
aren't Shakespeare's, it doesn't seem that a few questions to Prospero
(with the responses described rather than recorded -- &quot;he tells you
that...&quot;) would break the spell. True, the game does have a note on
each character available when you type the name at the prompt -- but
there are other things that bear explanation. The desire to avoid
dialogue that isn't Shakespeare's is understandable, but it shouldn't
override the necessity that a player understand what's going on.

Also problematic is that some of the action does not actually turn on
anything Ariel does, meaning that, in some cases, _very_ lengthy
stretches of text go by before you get a prompt again -- which isn't a
problem the first time, but might be if you have to replay that
section for some reason -- and in other cases, you set off a scene
merely by walking into a room. And in a few cases, though your action
does trigger the advance in the plot, the connection feels a bit
strained -- and it's those cases where what's required of you is
particularly hard to guess. Ariel changes shape now and again, as the
play dictates, but the way you prompt them -- when you do; sometimes
it just happens -- feels random and impossible to guess.  Though these
problems speak to the difficulty of the project, it is undeniable that
Tempest is not, for all its charm, a particularly playable game.

Even so, I enjoyed the experience -- though, I must say, I enjoy
Shakespeare as a whole, and being thrust into the middle of the play
was entertainment enough for me. Simply having a setting to match and
make sense of the action was in many cases helpful and illuminating --
it made sense of the plot in a way that Shakespeare's stage directions
sometimes do not -- and the cut scenes that happen in response to
certain actions give the player a sense of how the story
progresses. And even though there is a feeling of being distinct from
the play, in that the prompts only come when the action stops and you
have to restart it, that does reinforce the sense that you're
controlling the events on the island and the various characters are,
in a sense, puppets. Of course, your ability to manipulate them is
severely limited by the plot of the play; there isn't much real
freedom to test your power. But the sensation is interesting all the
same.  I found the &quot;performance&quot; genuinely involving in a way that
simply reading the text could not reproduce. The sequence of events is
variable, to some extent -- certain scenes can be triggered at
different times -- but never, as far as I can tell, can you delay or
speed up an event in a way that doesn't make sense. And whatever the
other faults of Tempest, it must be conceeded that Nelson's
Elizabethan is outstanding; even the most mundane responses are
written convincingly.

The difficulty remains -- how to rate this? Though the gameplay
limitations of Tempest are considerable, they are there for a valid
reason, not simply inadequate coding -- and, as such, I decided they
shouldn't count too heavily aganist the game. Though it doesn't &quot;work&quot;
especially well, the concept as put into practice works about as well
as it could, and the author should get some credit for a worthy
effort. I gave it a 7 on the competition scale, and think that a few
minor changes -- like the addition of a hint system, ideally in
Elizabethan -- could make this one highly enjoyable.

    &quot;Yet look, how far
    The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
    In underprizing it, so far this shadow
    Doth limp behind the substance.&quot; 
                         -- William Shakespeare
                     The Merchant of Venice III.ii.126-129

The Tempest attempts a great deal, and achieves much of it despite
being somewhat flawed. The work presents itself not as a game, but as
an &quot;interactive performance&quot; which asks the player to perform as the
magical will of Shakespeare's Prospero, guiding the spirit Ariel
(a.k.a. the parser) through the plot of The Tempest (the play), though
not necessarily in the order in which Shakespeare wrote
it. Remarkably, this complicated positioning of subjectivity works
quite well (and opens some unexplored territory for the mixing of
first, second, and third person forms of address in IF). It is blended
with a new approach to dialogue which prevents the player character
from speaking at all but presents many screenfuls of dialogue between
other characters (and sometimes including Ariel himself), the
exchanges broken up by pausing for keystrokes between each character's
lines. In a sense, the player's commands to the parser become
essentially stage directions issued to an onstage persona via a
magical conduit. This idiom also works beautifully, bestowing the game
with a powerful aura of theatrical performance. The Tempest is
entertaining and innovative; it often feels quite magical to inhabit
the Prospero/Ariel connection, and to take part in a groundbreaking
interactive experience. I think that the game also has great potential
as an educational tool, allowing readers to experience Shakespeare's
language in a new and thrilling way.

All this being said, however, the Tempest is not without its problems.
Actually, perhaps the game just has one major problem which manifests
itself in several ways. Although the game does an excellent (sometimes
astonishing) job of rearranging Shakespeare's scenes and lines to fit
the interactive mode, the fit is not perfect. Several times during the
game I felt faced with responses which, if not complete non sequiturs,
were certainly only tenuously connected to the command I had
typed. Tempest wrenches in bits and pieces of dialogue from all over
the play for various purposes, pressing them into service as room
descriptions, parser rejoinders, and other sundry purposes. Sometimes
they are perfectly suited to their purpose and sometimes less so. When
I was on the wrong end of this continuum, my relationship with the
game became strained -- the parser's responses were beautiful, but
didn't make enough sense, and not because of any opacity in the
Elizabethan English. This situation creates a problem with the game's
puzzles: usually interactive fiction prose can be written in such a
way as to suggest subtle hints to the problems facing the
player. However, when control of the prose escapes the author, those
hints become harder and harder for a player to come by. It is to this
difficulty with the prose (and, of course, to the lack of any hint
system or walkthrough) that I ascribe the problems I've seen players
having, often with the very first puzzle of the game. With a typical
piece of IF, the game could simply tailor its responses to help the
player along -- the Tempest often achieves this goal, but all too
often it falls short.

Plot: I predict that a certain contingent of voices will raise the hue
and cry over what they perceive to be the Tempest's lack of
interactivity. I wasn't able to finish the game in two hours (far from
it, in fact -- I got only six points, another example of an excellent
competition game which breaks the two-hour rule), but the parts I saw
made it pretty clear that the game leads you along rather carefully
from one plot point to the next, allowing for very little
branching. My own opinion is that this structure is not a problem --
after all, the piece bills itself as &quot;more a 'performance' than a
'game',&quot; and as such it's perfectly appropriate for the Tempest to
enforce a certain degree of rigidity to accommodate the exigencies of
its plot. In fact, what this achieves is the inclusion of a much more
complicated plot than is common in interactive fiction; by limiting
the player's ability to affect the narrative stream, the game allows
the complexity of Shakespeare's plotting to shine through even in this
challenging new form. I'm satisfied with the trade-off.

Prose: I suppose this is where I ought to weigh in on the debate over
the originality of a work like the IF version of the Tempest. It's my
opinion that the IF Tempest is absolutely a different piece of work
from the Tempest, the play. Yes, the author uses almost the entire
script of the play, but I would argue that such usage is not
plagiarism, because whatever Shakespeare's intentions, I think it's
safe to say that the play was not written to be adapted into
interactive form. Consequently, I don't see the IF Tempest as any less
an original work than Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility or, for
that matter, Shakespeare's MacBeth (whose plot was lifted from
Holinshed's histories.) Yes, the seams do sometimes show between the
author's additions and Shakespeare's text -- these are the work's
weaker moments. However, in judging the Tempest's prose, I judge not
the quality of Shakespeare's writing, but the quality of its usage in
its new medium -- on that basis, more often than not, it succeeds.

Puzzles: As noted above, this is where I identify the major weakness
of the Tempest. [SPOILERS AHEAD] I cite as an example the first puzzle
of the game, where Ariel must blow a storm to upset the boat and set
the plot into motion. The reason that players are finding this puzzle
so difficult is that it requires rather close knowledge of the play
(and not just of the play's first scene), which most players, even
very well educated ones, are not likely to have at their
fingertips. No hint is given of Ariel's powers or of his purpose in
regard to the ship. Now, in a typical IF game, there might be a
sentence or two in the introductory paragraph which introduces the
idea and sets players on their way. However, because of the
constraints imposed by using a collage of prewritten text, these hints
are unavailable and thus players flounder in a
&quot;read-the-playwright/designer's-mind&quot; sort of puzzle. It won't be the
last time.

Technical:
writing -- The prose did an excellent job with handling a number of
difficult technical tasks with regard to writing and using Elizabethan
English.

coding -- I found only one bug in Tempest (at least, I think it was a
bug), among a thoroughly reworked library of Inform responses and the
introduction of a number of excellent devices for the presentation of
dialogue and clarification of the plot.

VERSION: Release 1

Hoary as the genre is, I'm a big fan of Lovecraftian horror, and The
Temple manages to nail the obscure sense of existential menace that
makes it work; the city it depicts feels almost like a living thing,
aged, decrepit, and full of hate, although the descriptions do provide a
few moments of unintentional hilarity (the "irregular-sized basalt
blocks of irregular size" spring to mind). Though there are no elements
that are specific to the Cthulhu Mythos that I could detect, the
dream-world setup echoes the best of Lovecraft's work, and while
Charles' longing for his lost love seems more out of Poe than anything
else, it certainly adds a welcome complexity to the theme; there's hope
as well as despair, which makes the ultimately positive ending fit the
story better than it would in a straight Lovecraft pastiche.

I enjoyed the puzzles and felt them to be generally well-integrated,
although that could reflect my own bias in favor of messing around with
rituals. I did need to consult the walkthrough at one point, since
knowing how much Lovecraft liked cats, I hadn't thought of throwing
things at the one in the game, but for the most part there were enough
clues to know both what to do next and why it was important.

The inclusion of an NPC in the same situation as the player was a nice
touch, permitting a few fun puzzles that required teamwork, and cleverly
allowing the author to play up the horror of the situation without being
forced to manipulate the player too heavy-handedly. I did run into one
fairly significant design bug -- Charles helped dig me out of a cave-in
after I opened up a portal and sent him back to his own time! -- but
aside from that, the game was quite solid.

It's true that The Temple isn't fleshed out as completely as it could
have been -- leaving plenty to the reader's imagination is a critical
part of Lovecraft's style, but it still would have been nice to know
more about the presence trapped in the vial, or have a better idea about
where the cultists generally got their victims -- and the puzzles
generally feel lightweight -- boiling two powders together isn't quite
as eldritch a ritual as I'd have liked. But it succeeds quite well at
evoking and sticking to a mood, and presenting gameplay that fits that
mood admirably.

VERSION: Version 3.3.1 (competition release)

Most of this game's text is written in a rhyming verse that many will
doubtless find tiresome, but that I actually liked. The sparse, tortured
syntax captured the feel of the piece quite well. However, it did cause
a bit of a problem when unaltered library messages were encountered. And
even when the messages were altered there was some evidence of
sloppiness, as when a message says you're alone even when you're not.
But such things remained minor annoyances and overall the text flowed
smoothly.

The story, on the other hand, often went in fits and starts. The game
follows an inverted logic (candles that take in rather than produce
light, etc.) that can be maddeningly difficult to unravel. While
checking the clues sometimes provides an "aha!" moment, just as often
the feeling is more along the lines of "well I wonder why _that_ would
work?" On the plus side, the game features a unique (as far as I know)
dual scoring system and a simple yet shrouded back story that I found
fun to unravel.

Overall, your mileage may vary, but I found Kaos an enjoyable pastime
and would recommend it to anyone willing to enter its skewed vision.

Do you know why you don't see any extremely tall golfers on the PGA
tour? Sure there are the odd anomalies, but by and large most
professional golfers are under 6'2'' (and over 90% shoot right handed,
but I won't get into that). The reason: Tall golfers have more in the
way of mechanics that they have to get right to hit a ball properly.
Because their arms and legs are longer, and correspondingly the arc of
their swing is bigger, the distance traveled from back swing to contact
is longer and more can potentially go wrong as the clubface approaches
the ball. As a result, any mistake (i.e., opening up the club face too
much) during a tall golfer's swing is magnified to a much greater extent
than it would be had the golfer been shorter. Having said that, if a
taller golfer gets all of his mechanics in place correctly, then the
resulting swing should produce a much better drive, all things being
equal, than that of a shorter golfer because of the extra power provided
by the increased leverage of the golfer's longer arms and body. The net
effect of this concept is that good shorter golfers should be more
polished and consistent than good taller golfers, but when taller
golfers get everything done correctly, they should be able to produce
better individual results than shorter golfers. 

Strangely enough, this concept parallels many an IF piece (nice segue,
eh?). Before we look at the comparison, let's start with a little IF
theory. The larger the IF game, the more rooms and more objects to
implement, and the greater the combinatorial explosion. What it means to
a game designer is this: Every time you add one object to the game, you
have to consider how it may need to interact with every other object in
the game. In essence, by adding one object you're potentially DOUBLING
the number of interactions that may need to be allowed (or disallowed,
with appropriate "you can't do that" messages). 

An example of how this can be a problem crops up in one of the largest
IF releases in recent memory, <a href = "m.html#mulldoon">The Mulldoon Legacy</a>. Mulldoon is a game
that taxes Inform's memory capabilities with an incredible amount of
rooms and objects. Although still impressively good, the problem with
its first release was that players tried to utilize obviously single-use
inventory items in logical ways, even though the author hadn't accounted
for all the possible uses of the many items in his game. And, in a few
cases, alternate solutions were found that were never intended by the
author. This lead to a bit of frustration on my part, although once I
thought about it, the sheer task of trying to come up with all the
possible combinations in a game like Mulldoon would be quite difficult
even for the most experienced author. 

The point is that the bigger the game, the more little oversights and
errors can be magnified into bigger ones and, much like a tall golfer's
swing, can cause adverse affects that affect the bigger picture. Suffice
it to say that bigger games that are technically competent and
consistent deserve much praise due to the sheer difficulty of reducing
this combinatorial explosion. The combinatorial explosion (or lack
thereof), is also the reason why I would expect a higher degree of
polish for a smaller game and be much more critical of such oversights.

Textfire Golf is a fairly small game and so, keeping my previous
opinions in mind, I would expect a high degree of polish (not as nice a
segue, I know, but I've been trying to work that golf analogy into a
review for, like, ever, and this seemed an appropriate place to do it).
To be honest, I would expect a high degree of polish anyway because of
the name in the authorial credits, so it was no surprise that Textfire
Golf impressed me in many ways. 

A halfway Z-abuse (not completely ASCII art-based like Z-snake, for
example), Textfire Golf also incorporates an interesting storyline for a
quick 9-hole game of golf. What makes this game really work though, is
the arcade-like feature of being able to control your ball's pace and
trajectory. This is done with a power meter that you stop with a press
of the space bar, and a trajectory meter that will result in you
slicing, hooking, or driving dead center. The method follows the
standard arcade power and trajectory meter pretty faithfully, and is
certainly an improvement on some of the older style golf games I've
played (the one I'm thinking of involves pushing a little white ball set
in the arcade's console, which gave the player little to no control over
the ball's distance and direction). 

The course itself isn't too difficult to play, and with the benefit of
the UNDO command you can always go back and retry a stroke if you've
made a mistake (if only it were that easy in real life). I actually
would have preferred it if the author removed the UNDO command, just to
keep us a bit honest. It would have, at the very least, provided me with
more incentive to replay the game in an attempt to get my score a little
lower. For players who only play the game to fiddle with the golfing
interface, this is especially true. Still, even with the UNDO feature
enabled, there are many reasons to try replaying this game as there are
multiple endings that take into account almost every contingency you can
think of (i.e., hitting your ball out of bounds 20 times in a row, or
putting with your driver). I came up with roughly 16 endings myself, but
I'm sure that there are more I didn't find.

The fiction side, as is typical of a Cadre game, is well written with
witty dialogue and Mr. Cadre's trademark snarky parser. The best bits of
prose for me came from your foursome's bastardized golfing lingo and
constant cheap shots. Here is a typical example:

   Ted's ball sails over the bridge and lands on the far side of the
   lake.

   Ed taps the ball off the tee and onto the fairway. "You do realize
   that if you keep us here till eleven it's coming out of your pay,"
   Ted points out.

   Fred shanks the ball into the lake. "Maggie, call Aquaman!" Ted
   yells.

Although interaction with the NPCs is limited (all you can really do is
ask your caddy for a certain club type), the interaction with the game's
environment is surprisingly rich, as the author has allowed for many
common golfing actions (common cheating techniques for example), and
some not-so-common actions that generate some interesting non-default
responses. Each hole is described creatively as well, and that's more of
a challenge than you'd probably think considering most golf holes have
similar types of scenery.

The storyline also proves to be more substantial than its initial
premise of a simple foursome of golf. You play the part of Ned, a lowly
hack who works for a construction company and wants to play with the big
boys. When an opening in the usual foursome appears, you're invited to
play and with the invitation comes an opportunity to assert your
position within the company's hierarchy. What may get lost while you're
enjoying the mechanics of swinging your golf club and taking in the
beautifully described scenery however, is that there are lofty issues
afoot with the PC. Ned, as it turns out, is a character fraught with
insecurity; so much so in fact that his constant overanalyzing leads to
an abnormal inability to act. In this respect, he reminded me of the
2000 XYZZY-award-winning PC from the 2000 IFComp game <a href = "r.html#rameses">Rameses</a>. When I
played through Textfire Golf I could see shades of J. Alfred Prufrock's
quote, "Do I dare to eat a peach?", creeping into the protagonist's
mindset as his constant self-critiquing leaves him unable to act, and
this was similar to my playing experience with Rameses. 

Comparing Rameses' protagonist with Ned, the big difference is that
while both are overanalytical in their mindset and are therefore unable
to act proactively, the Rameses PC WILL NOT act regardless of what the
player types. This essentially relegates the player to the role of
conscience or voice of reason that the protagonist refuses to listen to.
Ned, on the other hand, can be broken out of his cocoon to do just about
anything. Also, unlike the Rameses PC where the failings of the
protagonist are specifically driven by his own inabilities, Ned seems to
have a streak of bad luck working against him that affects him
regardless of his actions. Of the 16 or so endings I found in the game,
none were positive (although it may be the case that I never saw the
optimal one). It's as if the golfing gods are punishing him for having
the hubris to elevate himself above his current place in the corporate
chain.

Hmmm... maybe I'm overanalyzing a bit. I suppose it could also be the
case that Ned's just unlucky and a bit shy. Also, keeping the author's
previous works in mind, there seems to be a real trend towards more
realistic endings as opposed to the overly happy, utopic ones. The
comment here may be that Ned was na&#239;ve in the first place to think one
golf game could change his future. Whatever the case, Ned is an
interesting PC to be sure, and more than I expected considering this
game was initially labeled a Z-abuse. 

OK, I think I've said enough. Let's wrap this baby up. For you golfing
fans, I think you'll get a real kick out of Textfire Golf and it's novel
golfing interface, and for everyone else, the dialogue and scenery
descriptions coupled with a more-than-skin-deep NPC are worth the time
it takes to download.

[This review contains some plot details, but spoils no puzzles.]

The introduction to &quot;Theatre&quot; explains that you are an estate agent,
trying to sell an old run-down theatre in a slum area of town.  It is
late in the evening, and you're in a hurry to see off the buyer and set
out to the opera, when you remember that you left your pager in the
basement.  After collecting it, you discover that your car has been
stolen, and a nasty thug turns up to make sure that you don't wander
off.  It looks as though you're going to have to spend the night in the
theatre unless you can find a phone and call the police.

You have to play through the above.  It takes a minimum of about ten
turns, but it feels very forced because the game won't allow you to
explore until you have finished the opening, and the &quotYou can't do that
yet, because that would be contrary to the plot&quot  messages come thick and
fast.  Perhaps the author could have found a more natural way to
restrict access to the rest of the theatre until the opening was
finished.

After the opening, the game becomes much wider.  You explore the haunted
theatre, at first in search of a way out, and then in search of magical
items necessary to thwart a certain evil power.  You find yourself
collecting the scattered pages of the 1898 journal of Eric Morris, the
man who drew the architects' plans for the theatre, which gradually
reveal a tantalising story of how he fell in love with Elizabeth, a
mysterious and beautiful woman who persuaded him to alter the plans in
nefarious ways.

My first impressions were very favourable.  The developing plot was
intriguing, and the atmosphere well-judged.  I imagined that the focus
would be on some tragic and melodramatic incident in the history of the
theatre (perhaps, I speculated wildly, this would be a jealous rivalry
between two leading actors over a woman, or a spurned prima donna who
killed herself).  The puzzles were logical and not over-hard, and the
programming was excellent: almost everything I tried produced an
intelligent response, and there were never any problems guessing verbs.
The developing journal entries kept me interested in looking around for
more.

If anything lets the game down, it's the quality of the prose, which
feels as though it has been very hastily written, without much attention
to grammar.  There are few memorable or vivid descriptions, and lots of
clumsy phrasing.  This is a particular problem with the journal entries,
which have an unfortunate Adrian Mole tone.

However, the game becomes weaker as it progresses.  The early sections
are original and interesting, but there comes a point where the game
loses its atmosphere and becomes a standard fantasy set in
H. P. Lovecraft's &quot;Cthulhu&quot; mythos.  A couple of scenes (the monster in
the library and the rats in the tunnels) feel as though they could have
been lifted straight out of Infocom's game &quot;<a href = "l.html#lurk">Lurking Horror</a>,&quot; also based
on Lovecraft's books.  The interesting exploration eventually comes to
an end with the disappointing realisation that this has been a simple
treasure hunting exercise: you have to find a collection of colour-coded
jewels of power and leave them in the correct place.

The author explained to me that because of time constraints, he hadn't
been able to spend as much time on the ending as he would have liked.
&quot;Theatre&quot; certainly feels as though it reached a certain point and then
was finished off in a desperate rush.  There are many loose ends: for
example, it is hinted that there is a cellular phone in the theatre, but
this never materialises.  Some of the closing scenes are very
unfortunate: for example, the appearance of Elizabeth near the end
completely spoils the characterisation of her that was established
through the journal.  It's very disappointing that there is no real
attempt to link the plot with the potentially interesting milieu of
early twentieth century theatre.

I don't want to sound too negative.  &quot;Theatre&quot; is excellent when
considered only as an adventure game, with good puzzles and superb
game-play.  I felt that it lacked the consistency and prose that would
have made it a good piece of fiction too.  But then I feel the same way
about <A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork</A> .

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag6.html">SPAG #6</a> -- July 26, 1995

In this game you are a property agent who, having just shown some clients
around a decrepit theatre, are annoyed to realise that you left your
electronic pager in the old building.  The game begins as you re-enter the
theatre with a view to retrieving this object before meeting friends at the
opera.  Suffice to say things do not go quite as planned.

_Theatre_ is very distinctly split into the traditional opening, mid-game and
end-game.  Indeed, the three sections seemed rather too distinct from each
other, lending a rather disjointed feel to the game.  Also contributing to
the feeling of disjointedness is the atmosphere, which changes about half way
through from ghostly psychological horror to semi-Lovecraftian `icky' horror,
more reliant on physical revulsion than a sense of `something's wrong'.  This
is a shame, as it reminds the player too much of _<a href = "l.html#lurk">The Lurking Horror</a>_ which
is the better game.  The opening is nice 'n easy for beginners with plenty of
advice in case you don't know what to do next.  This may be frustrating for
more experienced players as it is very linear.  The middle game opens up
more, with several well thought out but familiar puzzles open to the player
at once.  However, as mentioned above, there is a sudden change of direction
in the atmosphere and style of the game, which was not to this reviewer's
tastes. The end-game is where _Theatre_ really falls down though, with a
short sequence of ill- or un- explained puzzles which, once finally solved,
leave the player with an unsatisfactory ending and a bitter aftertaste.

Hmm, the previous paragraph gives the impression that I didn't like
_Theatre_.  This is not true, there are many good points to recommend the
game.  For a start it seems an excellent game for the beginning IF player,
boasting several pages of a well written `Introduction to text adventures' as
well as a short non-interactive demonstration and a useful explanation of the
way the parser works.  The parser itself, in common with all Inform games, is
excellent.  The puzzles, although they've mostly been seen before in various
incarnations, are both logical and fair (again apart from the last few). 
There are also some nice little touches along the way, such as the system for
reading the diary pages which you pick up along the way (a clever use of
Inform's menu system), the adaptive on-line hints, and the fact that the game
starts in verbose mode rather than brief.

To summarize, _Theatre_ is far from perfect but is perfectly adequate with
several enjoyable moments and a nice `polish' to it.  It is a damn sight
better than many shareware games out there, and it's free.  Try it, you might
like it.  Akk!  I can't believe I wrote that...

NAME:     There's a Hole In Your Bucket
AUTHOR: Karen Tyers
EMAIL:   <a href = "mailto:karvic@tesco.net">karvic SP@G tesco.net</a>
DATE:     1998
PARSER: PAW (Professional Adventure Writer)
SUPPORTS:      Spectrum and emulators
AVAILABILITY:  Adventure Workshop, 36 Grasmere Road, Royton, Oldham,
               Lancs, OL2 6SR, England
Also: Adventure Probe Magazine,
      52 Burford Road, Liverpool, L16 6AQ, England
Other games may be had for C64 and Amiga, inquire of author.
Price:  A small fee for postage and handling to the Workshop
or an optional donation to Adventure Probe magazine if emailed by Karen.

Adventure Probe is a small, hand assembled magazine published by Karen
Tyers.  It contains reviews, hints and a walk-through each month.
Most of the games are for the C64 or Amiga, but some are pc.  Its
listed price is two pounds sterling (in England).  There is no
provision for foreign money.  The February issue has 50 pages, 6&quot; x
8.5&quot;.  For those in UK, there is a telephone help line and solutions
can be downloaded.

BUCKET is a charming small game based on a folk song, &quot;I've Got A Hole In
My Bucket, Dear Liza&quot;.  The player first learns that his wife, Liza, wants
some water to wash the windows and there is none.  During his search for
a water source and a bucket, he finds the duck pond is empty and the ducks
are miserable.  Blossom, the sow, is most unco-operative and the chickens
are hungry.  By frequent use of the LOOK command coupled with BEHIND, IN,
or UNDER, the player's search is rewarded with objects leading to success
in achieving this goal.  Besides the farm area, there is a five room house.
Liza does not contribute much, but is an npc.  The only HELP is a reminder
to follow the words in the song.

Emulators: the Lunter Z80 emulator (registered) is used by the author
with Win 95 and she reports that it works fine.  OTOH, I use DOS and
found that the Lunter emulator (shareware) did not work well with the
pentium/60MHz, but does work well with a 486/30MHz.  I downloaded the
other pc emulator and it does work with the pentium, but not .z80
files.  Of course, that may just be my pentium.  I was playing with
the PAW .z80 file and not with a .sna file.  The author now has a
proper .sna file ready.  At some future time, she hopes to have pc
versions written with Inform or TADS.

The song: There's a hole in my bucket dear Liza, dear Liza.
          There's a hole im my bucket, dear Liza.
              Well, mend it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry.
              Well, mend it dear Henry, mend it.
          With what shall I mend it, dear Liza? (etc).
              With some straw, dear Henry (etc)
          But the straw is too long, dear Liza, (etc)
              Well, cut it, dear Henry (etc)
          With what shall I cut it, dear Liza? (etc)
              With an axe, dear Henry (etc)
          But the axe is too blunt, dear Liza (etc)
              Well, sharpen it, dear Henry (etc)
          With what shall I sharpen it, dear Liza? (etc)
              With a stone, dear Henry (etc)
          But the stone is too dry, dear Liza (etc)
              Well, wet it, dear Henry (etc)
          With what shall I wet it, dear Liza? (etc)
              Try water, dear Henry (etc)
          In what shall I fetch it, dear Liza? (etc)
              In a bucket, dear Henry (etc)

I prefer not to rate games.  I enjoyed playing this one or would not
offer a review.  There were two 'hunt the verb' problems; one easily
resolved, but the other could be a sticker.  However, this could be a
difference in culture, so Americans might have more trouble than
others.  I am not sure younger players with no experience with C64, RS
Color Computers, Spectrum, etc, would be interested.  These games do
not resemble MYST, et al, but are great for older players.

TITLE: There's a Snake in the Bathtub
AUTHOR: Edward Griffiths
EMAIL: ?
DATE: 2006
PARSER: Inform 6
SUPPORTS: Z-code interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware
URL: <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/bathtub.z5">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/bathtub.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 1

I came across this game largely by chance: it was announced in the usual "recent 
additions to the archive" post, but I don't think it was mentioned on 
rec.games.int-fiction or otherwise promoted to the community. So it may not have 
gotten much notice.

Mild spoilers about the structure follow; if you want to avoid all contact, stop 
reading now, though I think I would have been glad to know these things, myself.

The premise of the game is exactly as given in the title: you get home from a 
hot sticky day, ready for a nice long soak, only to find that the tub is 
occupied. From there, everything just gets increasingly surreal and out of hand, 
eventually requiring visits to alternative dimensions and so on. "Slice of life" 
this is not.

There are a number of implementation details that add up to make things a bit 
frustrating. There's very little here by way of implicit action handling; 
everything has to be explicitly opened and closed for use, for instance. 
Disambiguation is sometimes inelegant. There is some mild verb guessing, too. 
You'll want to read the list of understood verbs (type HELP at the outset of the 
game), but even then, there is one important command where ATTACH FOO TO BAR 
works, but ATTACH BAR TO FOO gives a generic failure message, and it's not clear 
what's gone wrong. Moreover, there are inventory limits, and they do get in the 
way. A hint system is provided, but it doesn't cover nearly everything one might 
want hints about, and in most cases it only told me the things about the puzzle 
that I'd already worked out myself: my notes say "More of a taunt system than a 
hint system." Well, I was feeling cranky.

There are also lots of low-level immersion-breakers (or possibly bugs): for 
instance, you can fill a bathtub with water, but this doesn't seem to affect the 
other contents of the bathtub in some of the ways you might expect. Sometimes 
it's possible to interact with creatures or objects even though they are 
technically untouchable at the moment. An action that broke an inventory item 
produced the change only some of the time, and I wasn't able to figure out why  
(though this turned out not to be game-critical). Likewise, many sensible 
actions aren't dealt with; you're not allowed to throw things at a certain 
object, even though that would be my first approach if I were in the same 
situation.

Worst of all, there is an absolutely fiendish 100-move time limit on the whole 
game. I replayed and replayed, trying to optimize, but without any luck. I was 
only able to finish the game when -- quite belatedly -- I realized there was 
actually a way to disable the limit entirely. It might not hurt to have further 
hinting in the game about that possibility.

For all that, "There's a Snake in the Bathtub" is not without charm. Much of the 
game revolves around defeating various malevolent figures, and it is generally 
quite rewarding when you finally succeed; in this respect the snake reminded me 
a little of the lobster in <a href="g.html#gourmet">Gourmet</a>. Many of the descriptions and events are
fairly entertaining, and there's pleasure in the sheer absurdity of many of the 
solutions. I have less to say about this than I do about the game's flaws, 
because enumerating all the funny moments would ruin them -- but I did find 
enough here to keep me playing despite the detractions listed.

In the end, then, this is an exuberant, slightly old-fashioned puzzle-fest, 
probably taking several hours to play without outside help. Some of those hours 
will be spent retracing your steps. Players in the mood for that kind of 
experience will enjoy this piece. Those looking for a strong story or a deeply 
implemented setting would be best advised to look elsewhere. "There's a Snake in 
the Bathtub" is not for the impatient -- though if you find yourself replaying  
endlessly to make that 100-move deadline, do consider ways to make the deadline 
go away.

From: Mike Harris (M.Harris SP@G spi-bpo.com)
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag44.html">SPAG #44</a> -- April 30, 2006

TITLE: Threnody
AUTHOR: John Schiff
EMAIL: john SP@G dopplerfx.com
DATE: March 13, 2005
PARSER: TADS 2
SUPPORTS: HTML TADS interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware
URL: <A HREF="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/springthing/2005/Threnody.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/springthing/2005/Threnody.zip</A>
VERSION: Release 1.0b

Threnody bills itself as "a lighthearted, puzzle-rich fantasy game" and as such 
hits the mark.  The backstory is a pedestrian "castle full of treasures" meme, 
with the mildly interesting twist that in addition to treasure &#8220;points&#8221; 
accumulated, each of the NPC&#8217;s has a "Catena" which must be located and 
destroyed to "release" the NPC, a tally of which scores in a parallel point 
system. 

The player must choose at the beginning whether the PC will be a warrior, wizard 
or thief, as well as the gender of the PC.  While the former affects what 
options the PC has available to solve portions of the game, the purpose of the 
gender choice seems only for fleshing out the story thread.  The verbiage is 
standard "fantasy 101" with the exception that objects&#8217; and sometimes NPC&#8217;s 
descriptions contain horrible puns.  The title NPC is a talking cat and is 
generally helpful as a guide but which purpose seems more to further the story 
than the game.  I delight in both bad puns and cats; those not so enamored might 
find the game less charming.

I prefer to be very methodical when playing IF, searching and examining 
everything in a room and solving as many puzzles as possible before moving on to 
the next room.  This approach works poorly with Threnody.  Those who prefer a 
brief visit to every accessible room before beginning any puzzle solving in 
earnest might find Threnody less frustrating.  Firstly, objects that might aid 
in solving puzzles are often available; I did a lot of guessing.  Secondly, many 
rooms and locations are empty, there as "place holders."  Lastly, the game is 
full of objects that seem to be nothing more than red herrings.

This leads us to bugs. 

It is possible to locate and destroy the Catenas of some NPC&#8217;s before 
encountering the NPC&#8217;s themselves.  While the disappearance/destruction of the 
NPC should mean its absence when its location is eventually found, this is not 
always the case.  Taking the Catenas to unusual locations to be destroyed will 
sometimes trigger the same bug.  In any case, this bug allows the game to be put 
in an unwinnable state as the NPC can not be vanquished.  I also stumbled upon a 
sequence of moves that "recreated" the Catena of one particular NPC, which I 
could then destroy repeatedly for points.

In some cases there is more than one way to "beat" the NPC, but I found another 
bug involving engaging a NPC in a game of chance using an object found 
elsewhere.  While defeating the NPC in the game of chance should achieve 
success, and the NPC states that you can take the (blank) because you&#8217;ve won, 
any attempt to actually do so results in the pre-defeat response.

I found the "red herrings" to be frustrating as well.  While they may not be 
true "red herrings" but have some purpose in solving puzzles when the PC is in a 
different iteration, their sheer number gets tedious &#8211; "open (blank) with 
(blank)"; "put (blank) on (blank)" is fun for the first thirty or forty tries 
but does start to pall once one gets into triple digits.  Furthermore, while the 
PC&#8217;s carrying capacity is large it&#8217;s not unlimited.  Three quarters of the way 
through the game I found that I was no longer able to pick up objects and had to 
decide which objects in my vast inventory to jettison, hoping that I would not 
rid myself of anything truly useful in the process.

While some puzzles are ludicrously simple, some are so difficult that I had no 
recourse but to refer to the hints or the walkthrough.  There is some trouble of 
the &#8220;guess the verb&#8221; variety but in many cases there seems to be no way to solve 
the puzzle except through brute force, trying every possible combination hoping 
that one works.

Some minor squawks &#8211; default responses sometimes come up when the story would 
dictate otherwise.  For example, upon entering a room there are often lavish 
descriptions of furnishings, floor etc., further examination of which elicits 
"you see nothing special about the (blank)" type responses, or directly 
contradictory responses &#8211; "The floor is made of large slabs of a dark, rough 
stone" after the description states something very different.  The story 
emphasizes the importance of the Catenas to the NPC&#8217;s, but (with the exception 
of the title NPC) showing the catena to the NPC elicits a default "(NPC) is not 
impressed."  And speaking of "guess the verb," during play I could often not 
recall the term "Catena" or names of NPC&#8217;s and more generic descriptions such as 
"man," "crystal" or "blue" were ineffective.

In summary, while Threnody is a mildly entertaining diversion exactly as 
advertised, its flaws and generic storyline made it less than compelling.  The 
optional graphics are very much like the game itself &#8211; workmanlike, well 
executed but ultimately unremarkable, and doing little to enhance the storyline. 
Once played through as one PC I had no desire to play more than a small amount 
with the PC in a different iteration, just enough to get a feel for that 
particular PC and some of the differences in puzzle solving.  On a scale of 1 to 
10 I would rate it a 5 for difficulty and an overall rating of 5.5 to 6.

VERSION: Release 1.0

Heh. Great title. One of the neatest things about this game is the way
the TADS is made to look like Inform, the way it used to look on my old
interpreter no less. This is indeed very kewl. But on to the game!

You play a scientist at some unspecified point in the future with a
nifty device that allows people to transfer their consciousness to other
people's bodies, apparently for a short time. You are going to use the
device to vacation on the surface for a while (oh, you and your fellow
scientists are at an underwater base, did I mention?) when something
goes horribly wrong. The scene where something goes horribly wrong is
actually sort of funny, and well-coded, and in general fun. For
instance, there's an emergency switch to open the door and get out. If
you try to pull it first, the game says "It's a push switch," and if you
try to push it first, it says "It's a pull switch," just to make you
take that extra turn. This is great. Normally, this sort of artificial
time-wasting is not great, it's just annoying, but it works here because
the game doesn't start until after you don't make it out of the first
scene. Clear?

Ah, there are some great moments in this game. The first two puzzles,
involving getting out of where you wake up, are terrific and clever (and
I solved them without hints). By the way, the hints come in three
different levels of helpfulness, and are location-dependent, so that
when you are in a certain room you get the hint for the puzzle it thinks
you're working on. Not always the right one, but it does take into
account what you have in your inventory, or at least it sure seems to.
It's very cool, although (as I said) problematic. Come to think of it, I
solved the next puzzle or two on my own also. Very well done.

What's also fun about the game is that you, as the player, actually know
more about your situation in some ways than the PC does. Then again, the
PC knows what the machine was supposed to do and you, the player, do
not. So it's kind of a trade-off. Still, the quirkiness and, well, I
almost want to say naivet&#233; of the PC are really very humorous. I lose
the humor a bit when I suspect that the PC knows things about how the
computer works that he isn't sharing, but with a few hints you can get
by. The password and key puzzle from the latter section of the game is
very very tricky, but quite novel and very good. By the way, when I was
halfway through the puzzle I thought, "All right! What's 'dog' in
French?" and typed "chien" without thinking much about it. When that
didn't work, I spent five minutes trying to remember how on Earth you
say "dog" in French (since I had it wrong). But as I said, the actual
solution was terrific.

Where does the game miss out? Well, there was the frustration of not
being able to do something and not finding any hints, because I was
going about the solution in the wrong way. I assumed I needed to
re-enter a room to get something, when actually I needed to be in a
different location to get what was in the room (thus the problem with
location-based hints). And there are some spelling mistakes and
punctuation quirks. At one point, the status line lists you as being "on
on the trolley." And an item is "far to heavy" to pick up. There are
also a few missing synonyms, like using "Rosalind" after she's in
pieces. And it's tough, I know it's tough, to implement being in a
location within a room by implementing it as a separate location (which
is what seems to have happened with the metal drawers). It's tricky
because there are basic things in the larger room that you want to be
able to refer to from the smaller section of room. Let me clear things
up: You are on a large drawer, pulled out from a wall of drawers, and
the room description mentions both metal drawers and a ceiling. But from
where you are you "don't see any ceiling here," nor the metal drawers.
It's a bit misleading, but very forgivable.

Anyway! For most of the game, the writing is either effective but not
attention-getting, or startlingly funny. For instance, a metal plate
sticks up from the ground "like a wafer in an ice cream," and later a
particular item is sticking up "like a cocktail stick from a sausage."
Those are attention-getting phrases, and while not smooth or sweet, they
do bring a chuckle. I did feel pretty involved in the story, even if I
didn't realize it until I was racing down the corridor on a metal
gurney, being pursued by God knows what, and it occurred to me that I
was pretty caught up in it. The best part was, I wasn't anxious or
worried about being caught by the thing because of the overall light and
amusing tone. Very impressive.

There was one programming trick which, while I liked it at the time,
caused me some puzzle-solving problems. If there was one particular
object that the game wanted to draw your attention to, it would prevent
you from examining other things by saying "Your eyes slide back to the
<item>." That's pretty slick, and also effective because the player
looks at whatever the thing is. The problem is, a line like that at the
bottom of a room description makes me skim the room description faster,
which means I missed critical objects that were listed and had no idea
(for instance) that there was a hand scanner in the control room. 

My only other complaint would be that the ending is somewhat
anticlimactic. I always like a good long ending that really wraps up all
the loose ends, or just hits you over the head with them, and I wasn't
really sure that the ending I got with Monk-Fish was the best one. I
don't see what I could have done differently, but I still wonder. 

Overall, a very strong work with excellent writing and clever puzzles.
Great job all around!

[This review contains minor spoilers for the beginning of the game.]

It would seem to me that 1995-1996 was the Year of the Time-Travel
Game.  Over the past 12 months, we've witnessed the appearance of <a href = "n.html#night">&quot;A
Night at the Museum Forever&quot;</a>, <a href = "j.html#jigsaw">&quot;Jigsaw&quot;</a>, and &quot;Lost New York&quot;, heard
rumors of Jon Drukman's not-yet-released &quot;Forward into the Past&quot;, and
are now faced with &quot;Time: All Things Come to an End.&quot;

Yes, &quot;Time&quot; is another time-travel game (!), and a more believable one
than &quot;Museum&quot;, but not quite up to the levels of realism attained by
Graham Nelson and Neil deMause.  It is well-programmed, and for the
most part well-written (though there are a surprising number of run-on
sentences, considering the author is from the U.K.).

I personally found the introduction rather hard to swallow.  As the
game began, a brilliant scientist (me) was in danger of having his
temporal translocator research project shut down due to lack of
progress.  Within 20 turns, however, I'd figured out how to power the
machine, taking advantage of an overhead lightning storm.  Considering
that the storm is described as &quot;typical English weather&quot;, the notion
of it taking YEARS to get around to considering lightning as a power
source seems positively ludicrous!  (&quot;Great Scott!&quot; as Dr. Emmitt
Brown himself might put it.)

To be fair, though, once you get the machine working and are whisked
into a cyberpunk-like dystopian future (perhaps the direct
consequences of your meddling with the timestream?), suspension of
disbelief kicks in, and &quot;Time&quot; becomes an enjoyable and surprisingly
playable work of I-F.

This came as quite a surprise to me, because the game itself is very
linear.  It's a single-path story with little room for
experimentation, puzzles requiring a great deal of note-taking and
foresight, and plenty of opportunities to become irrevocably stuck.
Normally I dislike stop-and-start gameplay.  For some reason, though,
this didn't make me hate it, even after a dozen or so setbacks.  I
can't quite explain why: The writing is good but not spectacular; The
settings aren't all that inspired; Most of the individual puzzles are
no more clever than the average game.

Yet for some reason it was very, very fun for me to play, and
discussions with other players led to the same conclusion.  There's
something about the *way* the puzzles are presented -- never
gratuitous, but as part of the story, giving the sense of plot
unfolding before the player; layered, interwoven with one another;
with virtually all reasonable actions accounted for -- that makes one
want to keep trying, even after dying countless horrible deaths.  Just
when you think you've finally gotten somewhere, &quot;Time&quot; tells you that
you don't.  But you're close, you just know it.  Maybe one more try...

Unfortunately, if you're weary of games that make you use information
gained from past lives, there's nothing I can do to disguise the fact
that &quot;Time&quot; is one of those games.  But I found it to be so enjoyable
that this so- called &quot;design flaw&quot; didn't even matter.  I recommend
that even crusaders for &quot;realistic&quot; I-F give this one a try.  You
might be pleasantly surprised.

Just save often.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag12.html">SPAG #12</a> -- December 13, 1997

As a reviewer should, I took it upon myself to replay Andy Phillips'
Time: All Things Come to an End before reviewing it, thereby to
produce a transcript. The exercise, such as it was, afforded some
insight: when the solutions to puzzles are so illogical or obscure
that they stump me completely -- even when I've _already_ finished the
game once -- something is gravely amiss. When getting through the
first half of the thing, even after I remember the solutions to the
puzzles, takes many, many tries because I forget stupid little items
that prove essential much later on, it says nothing positive about a
game. And when I am unable to keep a coherent transcript because of
all the saving and restoring required to get through the
every-move-accounted-for sections, well, the resulting review will be
less than glowing.

Trashing Andy Phillips has, admittedly, become a trend of late, so I
will try to be as positive as possible in reviewing Time... To wit:
somehow, for some reason, I plowed through this thing to begin with;
it kept me interested enough to forgive its faults and push on to the
end. I can't explain what it was now, and I certainly don't feel
compelled to slog through games I genuinely dislike. But on some
level, for me at least, Mr.  Phillips did manage to craft a game that
held my attention, and he deserves recognition for that.

On, then, to the game. As has been pointed out, Time... is an example
of a heavily linear game, meaning that fairly narrow sections of the
thing are available at any given time -- and, moreover, past sections
become unavailable once apparently disposed with. Handled well, this
sort of game can tell an interesting story and keep the plot moving
along with the game; handled poorly, it can be both frustrating and
dull -- because the confines of the plot can keep the player in a
small section of the game for a long time, with nothing to do but
examine the same objects over and over and beat his head against the
wall. More importantly, if not designed well, the player can lock
himself out of winning the game without realizing it.

And Time..., I'm sorry to say, is linear in just about the worst way a
game can be. Things like manipulating the scenery, holding onto
objects that seem fundamentally single-use, and obtaining objects with
no apparent use -- all are required actions for unforeseeable later
events. Players are advised never, NEVER, to assume an object has
exhausted its usefulness, or to leave a game area -- for the first
quarter or so of the game, you'll be doing that every few moves --
without taking absolutely everything that isn't nailed down. Except,
of course, for those objects that get you killed if you keep carrying
them past a certain point. And then there's the object that you break
in one scene but pick up and use later, and the murder weapon that you
are expected to take with you and use in an unforeseeable way, and, of
course, the many puzzles that you must solve for no other reason than
that there are some strange objects sitting around... I trust the
problems are becoming apparent.

There are many and various puzzles in Time... that require knowledge
obtained by death. The most egregious of them involves an apartment
where, let's see, failing to hide your means of getting into the
apartment (since they are noticed by a search that begins only after
you enter the apartment) and otherwise cover your tracks before anyone
actually starts looking for you, failing to realize that the police
are outside watching the apartment and will charge at the least sign
you are there, failing to realize that the police will kill you if you
are holding certain items when they get there, failing to realize that
another person will kill you if you are holding certain different
items when the police get there, and failing to disable an bomb that
will kill the police when they get there, all result in death -- plus,
of course, there are items to obtain while you're there, and the whole
thing is time-sensitive. If this one section of the game didn't screen
out quite a few would-be players, the IF world is more persistent than
I realized.

The problem with learning by death, quite aside from the realism issue
(&quot;I'd better drop the gun because I remember from the last time that
the police will kill me if I'm holding it when they get here&quot;), is
that it makes a game less enjoyable; there's nothing like playing
through a scene 50 times to make it unspeakably boring. The advantage
of linearity is that the author can control the story he tells, but
Mr. Phillips largely sacrifices that advantage by making the puzzles
so obscure that the story does not exactly move along.

How unfair are the puzzles in Time?... There are sections where the
plot resembles an action movie and the puzzles require action-movie
suspensions of disbelief, like, say, that no one notices you stealing
a helicopter, that you can learn to pilot the helicopter instantly
(well, that a reasonably with-it first grader can pilot a helicopter,
I guess), that you can get into a second-floor apartment using the
materials that come to hand -- and these, while a bit annoying, are
part of the genre. But there are far worse moments -- for example, the
instructions at one point are that you should &quot;use the stasis field,&quot;
which I found less than helpful. You miraculously sense that a statue
is actually something completely different in disguise, with no hints
to that effect. You wait seven turns in a location for the means of
solving a puzzle to appear -- though it was there all along; you just
hadn't &quot;noticed&quot; it. Other things are likewise hidden until you type
certain sensory commands, and so on.

The game is largely devoid of helpful hints, requires absurdly exact
syntax in many cases -- notably, getting out of the map room, which
required both a huge intuitive leap regarding the procedure and a game
of guess-the-verb for the final action. Another puzzle involving a
crate is looking for a certain verb that is, in truth, used fairly
frequently in IF these days -- but not in the context you find it
here.  Magical/technologically advanced objects (the line between them
is fairly blurry here) do things that could not possibly be foreseen
-- the same object, even, will have several uses that have little in
common. There is a time-paradox puzzle that, well, seems frankly
absurd -- not only for the objects that cannot logically exist, but
for the reactions to you by someone who, even accepting the paradoz,
could not have encountered you before. (It also serves no real purpose
in the game -- it provides information that could easily have been
provided another way.) One puzzle requires such a ludicrous disregard
of scale that when I saw it in the walkthrough, I assumed I had missed
something important earlier on. And whenever you are under duress --
meaning that someone is about to kill you, which is the case virtually
every moment -- objects in your backpack are unavailable on grounds
that you have more important things to do than &quot;fiddling with&quot;
whatever -- and inventory management before the scenes (requiring
amazing foreknowledge of what you'll need) is, of course, necessary.

And then, of course, there's the writing. There are worse sins than
the occasional comma splice, but the writing here is littered with
them -- e.g. &quot;A fire burns in one corner of the room, its red glow is
highly appropriate to the surroundings.&quot; The syntax of many room
descriptions is so tortured that the idea doesn't come across, as in:
&quot;To the north of you is the vast expanse of the park's solitary lake,
looking dull, a reflection of the dark sky and equally dark feeling
about this whole place.&quot; Er, what? There is a genuine attempt here to
provide atmosphere, but too often it produces results like these:

        A well-worn road running from west to east, with the park
        gates to the north. Some distance to the east, the street ends
        in a bricked up wall, while it opens up into some kind of
        large square to the west. The area is deserted, almost as if
        the inhabitants have given up on this terrible world.

        You are in what appears to be the central area of the town,
        market stalls lie abandoned and a few people hurriedly walk
        from one area to another, as if in a hopeless attempt to avoid
        this apparent centre of the evil. Most areas have been
        cordoned off, except for the seemingly important stone
        building to the south.

Good writing usually tries to show the reader the scene and let him
infer from there, rather than telling him outright what to feel or
think; the scenes above might have been quite effective if they had
included, say, descriptions of passers-by who walk by with their heads
down without speaking to each other, or if the player had encountered
someone who was clearly afraid of a certain building and nervous about
speaking too loud.  As it is, the atmosphere here becomes
self-parodying, since evil and menace are so obvious and ubiquitous
that they become unremarkable. (&quot;And our weather report: partly
cloudy, with an undercurrent of evil throughout the afternoon.&quot;) At
times, the author lays off the brooding menace and dread, and the
results are effective...

        The moonlight casts eerie shadows onto the buildings that
        surround the central courtyard. The western edge is dominated
        by a building seemingly still in use, but the Schloss is
        otherwise deserted.

...but those moments are, alas, all too few. In one region, you are
given the message &quot;Somewhere nearby someone screams with pain, you
don't even want to imagine the horrors taking place in these depths&quot;
so often, with no variation, that it loses whatever power it had to
shock. Ho-hum, more screams of pain. Now and again, the prose turns
deep purple:

        The shocking handiwork of your murderous psychotic enemy is
        evident again, notably from the red marks left by the
        murderous tool on the man's neck.  From the depths of the
        lifeless eyes seems to come a pleading for mercy which was
        coldly rejected by the smiling sadist responsible for this
        barbaric slaughter.

The point of all this is not simply to make fun of the writing,
tempting though that might be after slogging through a game worth of
it, but to show that bad writing can reduce enjoyment of a game by
wrecking the scene it tries to set.

True, many readers will forgive excess -- but when you force a player
to inhabit a small section of the game for a while, and hence
encounter the same descriptions again and again, it behooves you as a
writer to make those descriptions effective -- or, at least, not
ridiculous. The &quot;enemy&quot; is an obvious example here; she is everywhere,
her motivations are wildly unclear, and upon your every encounter with
her, she spouts bad-guy lines from action movies that break whatever
tension had been achieved. (&quot;You fools, did you really think you could
oppose the ultimate race?&quot; &quot;You know, I'm going to have to put a stop
to your interferences.&quot;) Said by someone like John Malkovich, things
like this are forgivable; as written text, no. So often did I stop to
chuckle at this or that in Time...that the plot became rather
uninvolving after a while. And a game this big needs to be involving
-- the writing needs to be passable -- to keep the player's attention.

It should be reiterated that there are enjoyable moments in Time... --
one scene involving assumption of another's identity does build up
tension well (even if the situation is a bit oversimplified), and
there is a genuinely clever, if not wholly logical, puzzle involving
the repair and use of a strange machine. And the author is quite good
at the principle of providing payoff for puzzles solved -- virtually
every discovery rewards you with a good bit of text and more things to
explore -- which helps in a game with lots of puzzles. The climax is
suitably climactic (though unfairly difficult -- very time-sensitive
and involving a thoroughly obscure riddle), and even the overwritten
scenes have their interesting moments, notably the segment in
London. On the whole, though, there is more to learn here about what
can go wrong in a game than about what can go right.

Time to Shine was the sole entry to David Fisher's CreatureComp.  I'm unaware
of the premise of the competition, but I assume it is one where the PC is a
non-human creature.  In this case the PC is a Caputman.

Time to Shine takes place amidst a lot of humans.  The way their behaviour and 
appearance is described does do a good job of making the PC seem very un-human 
but initially in a kind of vague odd way.  This accentuates the chasm between 
the PC and the player.  Normally this sort of thing gets in the way in a game, 
but here it's intended; part of what makes the game interesting is that the 
player has to investigate the PC by having the PC investigate the game's world, 
and thereby acquire an understanding of the PC.  The various actions, and 
responses to inaction, cause the player to form an increasingly refined model 
of the PC as various hypotheses are entertained and rejected.  The resulting 
form that the Caputman's take in this player's mind is deliberately comical; a 
light-hearted theme present throughout Time to Shine.

Quite a large amount of the early game appears to be about exploring the PC's 
nature, so it's important that this be handled believably.  The Caputman PC, it 
would seem, has little knowledge of human behavour, appearance, etc, and is 
suprised by certain aspects of their anatomy (their _feet_ for example).  But 
Caputmans are apparently just as familiar with, for example, PVC as humans are. 
 Is describing something in inches a convenience for me the player or a metric 
norm shared by Caputmans and humans alike?  The game never provides answers for 
such questions.

The writing is good, error free and occasionally knowingly self-referential: "A 
few dustbins help create an original urban back alley atmosphere".  The author 
is milking a clich&#233; here and plainly know that dustbins are not an original 
atmospheric device.  Describing them as such serves only to heighten their 
importance, drawing the player to investigate them.  As if I somehow wasn't 
going to EXAMINE everything I could see anyway.  The writing has a good voice; 
it's funny without being overly comedic, and is consistent from beginning to 
end.

The PC's motivations, to get a key NPC to fall in love with him, pretty much 
have to be taken as given.  Whilst some attempt is made to establish these 
motivations and engage the player along the same lines, the attempts are a bit 
weak: "You could probably get in there unseen, but what good would that do? You 
need a plan to make your beloved love you." Do I?  Oh, okay then.  Similarly, 
one of the early puzzles revolves around acquiring an object (of apparent 
value), but in terms of the plot it's not really clear why the PC would want 
the object; the solution to this puzzle, whilst clued and fair, doesn't really 
seem sensible, though it does enrich the player's model of Caputmans.  Only 
after solving the puzzle does the purpose of the object become clear; an NPC 
provides a blatant opportunity to fill-in some of the background and purpose 
behind this puzzle but that opportunity isn't exploited.  In fact the NPC in 
question appears to be nothing more than a mysterious prop unti!
 l the puzzle is solved.

The key NPC is never described concretely and this one of the reasons why I 
think the player fails to be as motivated as the PC.  The following transcript 
fragment:
  X HER 
  Words are failing you. Sadly, she doesn&#8217;t notice you.
is typical.  I assume the author is deliberately refraining from describing the 
beauty of this person, but I think it would help the player.

Hmm, I did something innocuous but immediately am overcome with a sense of 
unwinnable state.  I restart.  On solving a relevant puzzle it becomes clear 
that I did achieve an unwinnable state (an accident of programming rather than 
deliberate design).  Still, restarting was hardly any trouble at all. Oh, 
sudden death with an attempt at comedy that isn't quite convincing.  Still, the 
action is only an UNDO away.

One early location that is revisited later on changes materially, but the only 
purpose behing the change seems to be to make you solve another puzzle 
essentially isomorphic to the first one.  Which is kinda annoying.

The game is short, very linear, and has about 3 or 4 puzzles (depending on how 
you count).  I expect most players will breeze through it in half-an-hour or 
so, I didn't use the hints.  The ending feels rushed and a bit unsurprising; it 
left me feeling underwhelmed.  To be honest I think some of the puzzles are 
reasonably solvable only because of the relatively few things available for the 
PC to do, so you'll pretty quickly hit upon the solution by trial and error.  
HINT (which is I used for the purposes of review) does indeed provide "cheap 
and easy hints", just as ABOUT avers.

The whole thing, whilst being very small and very linear, is competently done.  
There are a few missing verbs, some synonyms for puzzle-solving actions might 
help the action flow a little more smoothly, but on the whole I get the 
impression that the author knows how to do all this stuff, she just didn't, 
either through constraints of time or laziness.  ABOUT says that "this game 
hasn&#8217;t been tested by anyone at all, and it probably shows", but actually it 
doesn't really show.  Sure, some of things I complain about would probably have 
be found and fixed by a bit of testing, but there's no mistakes with the text, 
all the puzzles work technically, and there's no glaring runtime-type bugs.  It 
presents the level of polish and completeness of a playable game as opposed to 
one which is in dire need of debugging.

Whilst Time to Shine is obviously deliberately short and frivolous it does 
leave me with good impressions about the author's ability.  It would be 
possible to clean up Time to Shine a bit and thereby improve it, and this would 
probably be worthwhile for the more niggly things, but what I'd really like to 
see is the author having the confidence to produce more notable works.  I think 
she's clearly capable of it.

puzzle game. It tells no story -- there is a plot, but that plot is
deliberately paper-thin, and makes sure that it doesn't get in the way
of the puzzles. The game itself has a simple, and well-tried goal: the
scavenger hunt, where you must find objects that have been placed in
totally arbitrary, but always hard to reach, locations. The nice thing
about Tinseltown Blues is that it has no pretensions of being anything
more than that -- it's a game, to be played and enjoyed, not anything
more, and it knows it.

While the game doesn't have a plot to speak of, it does have an
interesting choice of location: Paramount Studios. The choice of a
Hollywood studio, while obviously at least partially motivated by the
fact that the game's author actually works there, is a nice touch --
where else would you expect to find office buildings side-by-side with
mechanical reconstructions of Zork I? At times, however, the liberties
that are taken with Paramount seem so strenuous -- all the NPCs have
totally cartoonish names, and some geography seems to have been tampered
with for the sake of the puzzles -- that I'm not sure the game wouldn't
have worked better in a fictional studio. If there was more in the game
that actually spoke of the real Paramount Studios I may have felt
differently, but other than a reference pamphlet and some celebrity
graves, there really wasn't anything there that had any particular
resonance for me. 

That, however, is a minor quibble, since the real heart of the game is
its puzzles. And, as far as puzzles go, it has some good ones. There are
quite a few of them, most of them in medium difficulty -- not so easy as
to not require any thought, but not hard enough to make me run to a
walkthrough at any point (which was fortunate, since the walkthrough was
written after I won the game, by myself). There are precious few
guess-the-verb situations, and it is very rare to be in a situation in
which you don't know what to do next -- it's usually a question of how.
Some alternate solutions are available, though not to all puzzles. The
puzzles aren't perfect -- there is one particular puzzle (the parrot),
for instance, where it was very clear to me what I had to do, but not
why it would help me -- I had to solve the puzzle in order to discover
why I needed to solve it. It is also possible to lock yourself into an
unwinnable state by missing certain events, but the time window given is
so wide that it's very unlikely that this would happen, as long as you
remember to wander around.

The interface presented a couple of issues, however. The game features
an item bulk system, where some items are too large to brought into
certain places, or to be carried simultaneously. This works quite well
as a way to narrow down the field of possible solutions to one or two of
the puzzles. The problem is that there is also an item weight system --
carrying heavy items tires you, and gives annoying messages and even
more annoying effects. There is absolutely no reason for this and it
doesn't contribute anything to the game.

There are some minor bugs -- a few typos, and one or two places where
items give incorrect descriptions (one locked door has the deadbolt on
the wrong side in the descriptions, though it functions correctly). None
of them seriously impaired my enjoyment of the game. Tinseltown Blues is
not an ambitious game, but what it does it does well, despite a few
minor nitpicks. If you enjoy puzzles, and want some that won't have you
pulling out your hair in frustration, I suggest trying it out.

This is a short game with a good amount of wit and charm to it, and it
shows that it is possible to make a one-room, one-puzzle (albeit a
layered, Babel Fish type puzzle) game that's entertaining.

The situation is that you are Professor Pettibone, eminent Victorian
Balloonist, on his attempt to circle the world in a balloon. Your
traveling companion has been replaced at the last minute by a Mr. Hubert
Booby, a rather shady character with a suspiciously bulging overcoat.
The puzzle of the game involves throwing enough weight out of the
balloon to clear an erupting volcano, and you have to prise items one at
a time (or sometimes, a half-dozen at a time) from Mr. Booby.

I turned to the walkthrough rather soon, just to get the game moving,
and relied on it a bit too much thereafter, worried that I was going to
do something out of order and make the game unwinnable. In fact, the
author was sometimes careful in this regard, and made it so that you
couldn't toss some items you still needed over the side. (But some you
could.) I had a few challenging guess-the-verb moments, including
figuring out the syntax for throwing things overboard, and the rather
dodgy necessity of using the non-standard verb 'MAKE' at a crucial
late-game step.

Having gotten that far, I decided to play the rest of the game without
looking at the walkthrough, which turned out to be the one time I should
have used it, because the ultimate turn of the game is a win/lose
scenario. I typed "PULL ROPE" instead of "PULL GAS VALVE ROPE," and I
lost. Since I hadn't saved the game, I had to start all over again and
replay the whole thing just to see the winning outcome, which was
irritating.

There were a couple of spelling errors, including one in the concluding
text of the winning scenario, and there were some odd tussles with the
parser on occasion:

   > cut buttons
   [...] finally, with a great rending sound the coat bursts
   open, spilling a multitude of diverse objects onto the floor
   of the basket! These items consist of a large framed painting,
   an enormous carpetbag, a bundle of twigs, a boomerang, an
   ear-trumpet, a toy donkey and a sleeping Saint Bernard dog...

   > throw twigs out
   I'm afraid the meaning of your words escapes me. Could you
   possibly rephrase that?

   > get twigs
   Take what?  

   > get bundle
   I pick up the smudge stick.

   > x it
   (the smudge stick)
   A bundle of cedar twigs and sprigs of sage bound together with
   coloured thread. [...]

   > throw twigs overboard
   I'm afraid the meaning of your words escapes me. Could you
   possibly rephrase that?

   > throw stick overboard
   I don't understand what you want me to do with the smudge stick.

   > throw stick
   I don't understand what you want me to do with the smudge stick.

   > throw smudge
   I'm afraid the meaning of your words escapes me. Could you
   possibly rephrase that?

   > throw smudge stick
   I toss the smudge stick over the side of the basket. After all
   I can't imagine what I might have needed it for...

I enjoyed the pop-up introductory picture that set the scene. The
dialogue of the game was very funny, as was the surprise of one of the
last items to be revealed hidden about Mr. Booby's person. If I had run
across this game in the Competition, I probably would have ranked it a 7
or an 8, depending on how charitable I was feeling. Overall, nicely
done.

VERSION: Release 1.0

This game has the same relentlessly cheerful narrative tone that Laura
Knauth's "<a href = "#trapped">Trapped in a One-Room Dilly</a>" did. I don't know whether such a
tone is good or bad on its own, but if the player happens to be in a
surly mood when it comes belting out at him, it can be a bit much.

However, I don't take off points for friendliness; I just thought I'd
mention it.

The first comment I'd like to make is a general one, but I'll use
"Tookie" as an example. I think that authors need to exercise restraint
when it comes to opening text. One brief paragraph will usually suffice,
if carefully crafted. If you need more than that to get across all of
the material you have imagined, perhaps what you need to do is start the
game in a different place, and have the exposition unfold interactively.

Here is the first third of "Tookie"'s opening text: 

   It started out a normal enough Saturday...

   You slept in late and watched part of the ball game in between naps,
   until Tookie, your faithful hound, ran over with the leash and would
   not be refused. You set out on a walk through the neighborhood (fully
   intending to be back in time to see the last few minutes of the
   game), when you spotted a rather strange thing in the sky.

By this point, I was already thinking to myself, "Gee, this could have
been done as IF, instead of as a cutscene." I could have started the
game plopped out on the couch, or whatever, and Tookie could have run in
with the leash and nagged at me until I figured out that I needed to put
the leash on his collar and take him outside. And then I could have been
alerted something in the sky, perhaps by Tookie, and EXAMINEd it for
myself.

It continues:

   Before you could say "Golly, I wonder what that is," an alien
   spacecraft had landed and three beings that looked like giant cats in
   silver jumpsuits had hopped out, grabbed Tookie right off his leash,
   and hustled him back into their spaceship! A voice hissed out at you,
   "Perhaps if you're clever enough, you can have him back, earthling,"
   and then the spacecraft jumped right into the ground, leaving nothing
   behind but a small hole and some scorch marks!

   Well, naturally enough, you started down the hole in pursuit of your
   dog! Man's best friend, and let's not forget this one is a purebred
   bloodhound, but the point is that no alien cat is going to steal your
   Tookie! The tunnel twisted and turned, but you followed it all the
   way down, slipping a bit at the end to find yourself here.... but
   where is here?

See what I mean? This material also could have been part of the game. It
might have been more fun, and more engaging of my interest. Although, if
it had started that way, I might have ended up being disappointed with
what I found down in the hole, which was a "collect the four gems"
set-up, with multiple puzzles obstructing the path to each one.

I can enjoy a good collect-the-gems game now and then. This one was not
bad, although I was groaning a bit when I discovered that one of the
puzzles was an algebra problem and another was a bowling match, even
though I knew there would probably be a sensible solution to each of
them.

I was going to complain about the very first puzzle in the game, the
acquisition of a ring of keys to the four locked doors, but I found out
later on that the element I was going to complain about reappeared to
more useful effect later in the game. Uh oh, thing-in-the-well won't let
me touch the keys! I'd better figure out how to defeat it! Except, uh, I
don't have anything to defeat it with. This turns out to be
misdirection, and you can get the keys anyway, and the defeating of the
thing in the well comes later on, for a different reason. Still, it kept
me thinking along the wrong lines enough so that I went to the hints
instead of solving it myself. I think that could have been designed a
bit better, because the actual solution to the keys problem, and the
in-game clues to solving it, were fairly original and clever, but I
didn't appreciate it very much because I had to look up the answer.

The game slightly confused me at one point, when I saw two rooms with
holes in the wall, one of which had a gigantic aquarium tank, and I put
a bowling ball through the hole in the wall upstairs from the tank,
heard a smashing of glass, and returned to the tank to see that nothing
had happened. I thought there was a bug, and I restarted, only to find
out the bowling ball had shown up again in a completely different place,
with no clue as to why. The in-game hints say that the aquarium is a
completely useless bit of scenery -- so, er, why is it there? Just
because the author had fun coding up a giant squid in a tank? I guess
that's allowed. I guess.

I had some gripes about the ring of keys, in that the game almost acted
like it was smart enough to disambiguate automatically which one I meant
-- I went south first, and the game took it upon itself to try the key
for that door for me. But, for the other three doors, the process was
more tedious. Once I have the key ring, the doors should just fling
themselves open when I walk in the right direction.

I want to point out two strange authorial choices that were irritating
when they did not need to be. First:

   >x door
   You can't put your finger on it, but something about the large door
   in the wall makes you think of it as a "dropping" door. There is a
   row of colored leaves hanging from the top of the door.

   >x leaves
   See the row of icicles text.

If you're going to bother to make a scenery object and give it a
description, just put an actual description there. Especially when a)
the reference is mimesis-breaking (mentioning game "text"), and b) the
reference, if consulted, doesn't make any sense:

   >x icicles
   Cool, sharp, aloof. Each icicle looks to be about a handswidth long,
   perfectly symmetrical, and slightly bluish. I suppose that's to be
   expected.

So the leaves are also cool, sharp, aloof, a handswidth long, perfectly
symmetrical, and slightly bluish, as to be expected?

The second example, similarly, shows the author taking the time to code
a response that provides an unhelpful redirection, instead of being
practical:

   >u
   The wide staircase curves around to enter the upstairs room on the
   north wall.

   Space Bar
   The walls here are decorated with black paint and pictures of stars
   and planets, which, coupled with the futuristic-looking tables and
   chairs scattered about and the bar, lead you to believe that what you
   are in is supposed to be, well, a space bar. The room is brightly
   lit, and all of the tables are empty of people, but there is a
   strange looking figure standing behind the bar. Finally, you can see
   the top of a curving staircase set in the north wall.

   >d
   There are two ways of going down from here: you may walk north to the
   spiral staircase, or enter the hole in the corner of the room.

If I can go "UP" to get here, why can't I go "DOWN" to leave by the same
staircase? You know where I want to go when I type that, because you put
the code there to print this message. Maybe it's that you wanted to make
sure I tried "ENTER HOLE" (which isn't actually an exit, either),
because the response to that command provides a hint for a puzzle. Bad
form.

I had some gripes about the solution to Eddie's math problem. [Rob's
answers have been changed to prevent the spoiler. --Paul] The problem
was that I was saying "4" instead of "FOUR," but I think that the author
could reasonably have accounted for this, sparing me trying a dozen
different variations:

   >say 4 p.m. to eddie
   >say "4 p.m." to eddie
   >eddie, 4 p.m.
   >answer 4 p.m. to eddie
   >answer 4 pm to eddie
   >answer "4 pm" to eddie
   >answer "4" to eddie
   >answer 4 to eddie
   >eddie, 4
   >say 4
   >say "4"
   >say "4 P.M."

My final gripe is that once the puzzle about Fred the bowling cat has
been "solved," you shouldn't have to sit through all ten frames of a
simulated bowling game. There really is no entertainment value to it,
especially when it's padded out with [More] prompts for some kind of
attempt at suspense. I can understand why coding this up was fun for the
author, but the effect on the player is, unfortunately, tedium.

   >BOWL <space> <space> <space> 
   >G <space> <space> <space> 
   >G <space> <space> <space> 
   [repeat 7 more times]

There is enthusiasm and energy to spare here, and some neat ideas. In
the endgame, your "performance" is assessed, which I thought was
amusing. Because I finished it after restarting, I took a few shortcuts
(such as grabbing the key ring directly), and was marked off for this.
Once again, I look forward to this brand-new author's next works, now
that they've gotten this initial batch of IF ideas out of their system,
and will have to dig a little deeper the next time.

Also, "TOOKiE'S SONG"? What song? And why the lowercase i in "TOOKiE"?

  Name: Toonesia                                Parser: TADS

  Puzzles: Original and rewarding               Supports: TADS ports
  Characters: Good, but a bit non-interactive
  Difficulty: Rather simple

In this delightful little game you assume the persona of Elmo Fuld,
millionare and hunter. When the game starts, it seems as if your
eternal adversary, Bud Bunny (that rascally rabbit!), holds a distinct
advantage: not only has he stolen your gun, but he's imprisoned you in
a room without an exit. But don't despair: you're as resourceful as
ever, and in this world the laws of nature are quite flexible... 

Does this sound familiar? It should, since this game is a loving
re-creation of the world of classic cartoons (with the names slightly
changed, probably for copyright reasons). During your adventures in
Toonesia (don't worry, you do escape your doorless prison) you'll meet
not only Bud Bunny but Dizzy Duck and other characters, and you'll end
up in a number of typical cartoon situations, hauntingly familiar yet
with certain new angles, situations posing problems that can only be
solved by thinking in the slightly twisted way of a 'toon. 

This game may not be very profound, but it's clearly one of the most
entertaining adventure games I've ever played. It's not very large and
not very difficult (and comes with extensive online hints if you're
stuck), the puzzles are all very much in character and have logical
and satisfying solutions (possibly with one exception: the helmet
problem seems a bit contrived), the ending is very appropriate, and
above all it's funny. 

My only complaint is that the game seems to have been rushed out in a
hurry (it was even released a week before the competition deadline),
giving it a slightly unpolished feeling in places. The NPCs could be a
bit more interactive, and there are a few inconsistencies (such as the
Tazmanian (sic) Devil escaping through a tunnel that ends inside a
locked cage - yet when you follow him, he's gone!). I found one quite
serious bug: for some reason, the room description of the mesa
reverses east and west, which made me quite frustrated when trying to
escape, until I literally stumbled onto the solution by
trial-and-error. 

These are relatively minor things, however. I hope that the author
will step forward after the competition to accept our congratulations;
with products of this quality, there's really no reason to be
anonymous.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag8.html">SPAG #8</a> -- February 5, 1996

I enjoyed playing &quot;Toonesia&quot;.  It captures a good deal of the flavour of
the cartoons it pastiches, and makes excellent use of the logic of the
cartoon world it takes place in: I found all of the puzzles were
solvable on the first attempt, and the majority were very good.

There were problems with the descriptions (the directions on the mesa
were reversed), and a few minor bugs (e.g., you could type &quot;enter hole&quot;
from the mesa and get there directly, rather than messing about with the
blindfold), but the main reason why I ranked &quot;<a href = "o.html#one">The One that Got Away</a>&quot;
higher was because &quot;Toonesia&quot; seemed to lack energy.

Palmer Davis <palmer SP@G ansoft.com> wrote the following in the
newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction:

    The writing could use a bit more polish, but still manages to
    capture the spirit of Saturday morning.  The NPCs don't, however --
    if you encounter Daffy Duck or the Tasmanian Devil in a &quot;real&quot;
    cartoon, he'll be in your face until Porky Pig shows up for the
    fadeout, rather than just standing around like they do here.

I agree entirely; the characters in &quot;Toonesia&quot; are too static, and the
game is directed too much by the player's own wanderings to be a
completely successful pastiche.  In a typical cartoon, Bugs would appear
right at the start and his running battle with Fudd would continue to
the end, with Fudd setting traps for Bugs and Bugs always escaping and
turning the tables.

You can make an NPC more interesting by giving him or her a strong
motivation and an ability to do things on his or her own initiative, not
just in response to the player's actions.  They are more interesting if
they react to each other's actions as well as to the player's.  And it
helps a lot just to give them many different things that they can do.
So in &quot;Toonesia&quot;, the player should have had to make several attempts to
deal with Bud, with interaction at each stage.  The other characters
should have had their own motivations and schemes which would either
provide additional hindrances, or present opportunities for subversion
by the player, or be just there for background.

Each storytelling medium has its own strengths and weaknesses. Animated
films, for instance, are wonderful at presenting frantic, surreal
absurdities. And text-adventure games are, unfortunately, poor at
creating and maintaining the pace of action in a story. 

Now, why, exactly, would I choose to point out that particular strength
of animation in the same paragraph as that particular weakness of IF? 

Because "Toonesia" is a light, pleasant hodgepodge of Warner Bros.
cartoons. And, while it effectively recreates the environment of a toon,
solving its puzzles will wreck the rabid tempo of the cartoons it's
paying homage to. 

Not that the puzzles are difficult. On the contrary, once you catch on
to their theme, which should be obvious from the game's title, the
conflicts in "Toonesia" are fairly simple, and entertaining, to resolve.

Unfortunately, "Toonesia's" other major flaw is not inherent in the
medium the author chose. While Weinstein did capture the essence of the
Warner Bros. characters, he failed to make any of them very interactive.
In the Warner Bros. world of hyperactive, clever, sarcastic characters,
this just doesn't work. The most interactive one, Dizzy Duck, is also
the most frustrating one. Oddly, Dizzy will react to Elmo's actions, but
to nothing that Elmo, the player character, says to him! 

"Toonesia" is too short to have as many settings as it has. Weinstein
shoveled the desert of Wylie Coyote and the Roadrunner, the woodlands of
Bugs Bunny, and an abandoned jewel mine into this game. 

One of the settings, the mine, complete with a greedy Dizzy Duck, isn't
even directly related to Elmo's goal, which is to kill the rabbit! And
the ending, lifted directly from the Bugs Bunny short with a Wagner
theme, jars the player. While the Wagner episode worked for the toon,
because it was an unusual setting and an odd story-telling method for a
series of shorts that are a little too similar to each other, it only
emphasizes the mismatched environment of this game. 

Although the programming is fairly transparent, you should beware of one
nasty bug. The description of the cliff walls from the Mesa will kill
your player character if you pay attention to it. The east-west
directions are reversed. 

Despite these weaknesses, "Toonesia" is still an agreeable game. The
writing is solid, and, although the author's voice rarely comes out,
when it does, it's funny. Try referring to the characters by their
Warner Bros. counterparts' names and you'll discover a mildly, and
amusingly, paranoid author denying any involvement in copyright
infringement.

  AUTHOR: Graeme Cree                     PLOT: Non Linear

  CHARACTERS: Simple                      DIFFICULTY: Very Easy

        &quot;Tossed Into Space&quot  tells a slightly weird science fiction story:
You are Dr. Schmidt, a saboteur who is trapped on the new colony of Alpha
Centauri.  Since the colonists (the Rob-&-Son family) refused to take you
home to earth, you have waited for an opportunity to steal their space-
ship &quot;Jupiter 8&quot;.  Finally, your time has come: The Rob-&-Son family is
not at home and the Jupiter is only guarded by a robot.  You have to get
rid of the robot, refuel the ship, set the course data and lift off.
        Apparently, &quot;Tossed Into Space&quot; was written for beginners; the
game is very short, simple and easy.  All the player has to do is to
perform the most basic exercises of text adventuring: bringing light to
a dark room, wearing appropriate clothes in a cold place or unlocking an
object with a key.  Experienced players will solve 'Tossed Into Space'
within an hour or less.  In fact, this game is so short that I cannot say
more without spoiling the entire game.
        Nevertheless, playing &quot;Tossed Into Space&quot; was fun.  The story is
amusing and the writing is all right as long as you don't mind a few
spelling mistakes.  The (AGT) parser is not comfortable, but satisfying.
'Tossed Into Space' is worth taking a look at, if you don't expect too much.

        [By the way, if you haven't guessed it yet, this game is a total
Lost in Space parody, but then, you knew that, right? -GKW]

ToughBeans.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 1

All in all, Tough Beans is a fine piece of work. It isn&#8217;t often where a
person&#8217;s first game (assuming Sara Dee isn&#8217;t a pseudonym) is so polished and
playable. &#8220;This is Sara Dee&#8217;s first game.&#8221; I kept thinking, though, that my
entry last year was Sidney Merk&#8217;s first game, too. Why didn&#8217;t she say &#8220;&#8230;my
first game&#8221; instead? Just semantics? Moving on.

Tough Beans does a better job of describing a day where everything just goes
wrong than does Son of a...(another entry in this year&#8217;s competition). The
story hints at something deeper, which remained unexplored up to my 3-point
ending. Was the early elevator scene a premonition of one possible ending 
(mishap with the firework)? Does Wendy have a mental illness, or some kind of
tumor that&#8217;s causing her numbness and flashbacks, or is that just for narrative
effect? What was her boyfriend&#8217;s motivation, beyond the obvious? The
walkthrough claims there are five endings, with variations to each. Does that
include the firework mishap? If not, then I found only one. I did identify a
key decision early on (it&#8217;s pretty obvious &#8211; the game tells you it&#8217;s a key
decision, more or less). I played briefly into each, and settled on just one.

The puzzles aren&#8217;t complicated, but they aren&#8217;t always easy. For puzzle experts,
this is probably perfect. The clues are usually just right. I made it to the
coffee shop before feeling stuck enough to peek at the walkthrough. I felt
guilty here, though, because I should have noticed what&#8217;s important after Rhoda
broke her pen. Some of it may still walk the border between fair and unfair &#8211;
the form goes unnoticed, for instance, even when looking right at the spot
where it&#8217;s found. I guess if I visualize the scene, and consider what I might
see walking up to my own desk &#8211; the orientation of it, and the angle of
approach &#8211; I guess I can see how a form might remain unnoticed until further
action is taken. I guess since it did work, and I found the form, then the
puzzle worked.

The bugs &#8211; what few there are &#8211; are minor. Looking at the kitchen table reports
a bowl, but searching it states nothing is on the table &#8211; that kind of thing.
Errors in the text are almost non-existent. The game succeeds very well as
fiction, where the level of implementation is deep and the writing stands out
as descriptive and emotional.

It&#8217;s a story about breaking cycles and standing up for yourself. Some of that
is obvious from a 3-point play-through, but the scoring hints in the
walkthrough make it more clear. I couldn&#8217;t quite decide what the story was
meant to achieve, though. Was it meant to be a poignant introspection into
Wendy&#8217;s psyche? Should I have felt bad for her, or should I have resolved to be
more assertive? Both? It wasn&#8217;t easy for me to recognize decision points aside
from the early one, and it wasn&#8217;t easy to think like a weepy 22-year-old
secretary. This game is going to hit the proverbial perfect note with some
players, but I never quite connected with the PC.

Fiction is less about writing main characters that are familiar to the audience
&#8211; that&#8217;s a playground for stereotypes &#8211; and more about writing main characters
that will become familiar to the audience. Games with a deemphasis on the PC&#8217;s
identity avoid this almost entirely, except where the PC&#8217;s motivations are
concerned. Whether or not Wendy is familiar to the author, she probably isn&#8217;t
familiar to many of us. The game succeeds in making her real, but not (for me,
anyway) in making her evolve.

I think more can be learned in the unseen, alternate endings. It&#8217;s a shame the
author didn&#8217;t include alternate walkthroughs, showing a ten-point ending. I&#8217;m
curious about what other actions I might take as Wendy, and how this will
reflect on those endings.

My scoring scale fits Tough Beans in somewhere between 8 and 9, so I have based
it at 8.5. I think it&#8217;s a great game even though I couldn&#8217;t connect with the
protagonist, and I think it&#8217;s going to do very well in the competition. It
deserves a +0.5 skew for great writing and a convincing game world. Unofficial
score: 9.0.

"I have seen no guards. The walls would be easy to climb. Why has not somebody 
stolen this secret gem?" the game begins (well almost).  Indeed, why not?  It's 
the perfect excuse to begin an adventure game.

The game, it turns out, is based on the Conan story by Robert E. Howard.  You 
get to play the part of Conan the Barbarian as he goes to the Elephant Tower of 
Yara the priest to steal the source of his magic, the Elephant's Heart jewel.  
I've never read any of the Conan stories, though I am vaguely familiar with 
style.

The writing is a real treat, vivid and undemanding.  Like pulp fiction should 
be.  Most of the writing is Howard's, though Andersson has done a very competent 
job of taking the words from their original linear format and embedding them 
into a text adventure.

The Tower of the Elephant is well implemented, with close to no outright bugs, 
and is generally polished.  I think the game could definitely benefit from 
implementing a few more scenery nouns.  In a literary adaptation this is, of 
course, a tricky business; how far should Andersson go in adding new 
descriptions?  Well, at least as far as the coping, the sward, the shrubbery 
(these examples from the first few locations).  In the Infocom era, this would 
have gone without a mention, but these days I think people expect a bit more.  
In a way though, I find it quite refreshing; it focuses the mind on the 
essentials.  The same complaint exists in the domain of verbs. Obvious 
manipulations of implemented objects are not always implemented.  You have a 
sword but you cannot draw nor wield it.  The following extract concerning a 
jewel is typical (There are lots of jewels in this game.  Some of them you can 
take, some of them you cannot):

>> x stone

A great round jewel, clear as crimson crystal.

>> look through stone

You find nothing of interest.

As someone who was not familiar with the story I would say that the game 
sometimes fails to mark "the way forward" with sufficient clues.  This is mostly 
only a problem early on when room descriptions fail to describe available exits. 
Really, I quibble because a player isn't likely to forget which way the tower is 
(unless they are deliberately wasting time trying lots of different things out 
like I was), and it's a sufficiently small game that it's never a huge problem 
anyway.  Also, the EXITS command is implemented.

Epistemic object naming comes into play.  An NPC thief is referred to as thief 
until you learn his name (optional), thence he is referred to using his name.  
Managing the player's knowledge is always a bit tricky, and later on the game 
falters when you meet Yag-kosha.  Yag-kosha never directly introduces himself 
directly, indeed at one point he addresses Yag-kosha as if talking to someone 
else, but the game immediately refers to Yag-kosha and apparently assumes you 
know the referent.  I did briefly wonder whether in Yag-kosha's language "Yag-
kosha" was a pronoun that could be used to refer to self and others equally 
(like some uses of "we" in English).

One of the puzzles, the spider combat, I found annoying.  Of the many things 
that a player could try only a few are implemented.  Not implementing DODGE and 
PARRY seems reasonable enough, at least the game is clear on that matter, but 
there are some actions that the game describes, but which cannot be executed 
voluntarily.  For example at one point the game says (in response to my not 
doing anything positive in attacking the spider) "You leap high, and the spider 
passes beneath you, wheels and charges back", but I cannot JUMP OVER SPIDER; I 
can JUMP, but I get the library response.  The required actions are not 
particular hard to guess, but they're not particularly well clued either.  The 
combat scene is on a timer (eventually the spider _will_ kill you), so I suspect 
most players will be restoring many times before they defeat the spider.  
Contrast this with the spider combat in Tales of the Traveling Swordsman where 
the actions are better clued (in fact, the clueing is progressive), and the game 
isn't quite so cruel at killing the player off.  It turns out there are 
solutions to the game that avoid the entire spider combat, so maybe it doesn't 
matter if I found it hard?  Well, that would be a more reasonable defense if it 
was possible to escape from the spider.  It's not as far as I can tell, and I 
can't really see why.

The game exhibits other branches as well (aside from the optional spider), in 
fact the more I play the game the more options and variation I find.  Somehow 
though this variation is presented poorly.  It's almost as if the game is trying 
to hide the fact that multiple solutions whilst letting players discover a 
solution that's natural to them.  It's hard to say what's going on without 
getting spoilery, but consider the spider combat.  Because of the way its 
arranged it's entirely likely that players that discover the spider combat will 
not discover the alternate path, and won't even be aware that there is one.  
Similarly, players that discover the alternate path will probably not discover 
the spider combat.  A similar situation exists with the thief.  It's cool that 
the game admits multiple solutions so some players will naturally discover one 
way and some players will naturally discover another, but I think most players 
will not realise that they have the option.  Tower of the Elephant is quite a 
short game, but exploring the alternate solutions provides a fair amount of 
replay value; and I encourage all players to do that so that Andersson's coding 
isn't wasted on you.

The game has a cruel moment (possibly more than one).  If you penetrate the 
secrets of the tower sufficiently but then leave before settling some business 
then you can wind up in an unwinnable state, confronting an all too mighty Yara, 
without it being clear and beyond the reach of undo.  This is probably a bug 
more than intentional.  Because of a slight clumsiness in the conversation it's 
perhaps a little bit easy to stumble into accidentally.

Overall I find the game engaging.  Conan, the PC, is a man of action and the 
writing encourages you to take action; it's compelling.  The situations are 
vivid and unusual.  When I wasn't frustrated by the puzzles I enjoyed them.  
NPCs are well characterized and sometimes surprising.  Conversation (relying 
heavily on Eric Eve's extensions I suspect) mostly works well with an ASK / TELL 
interface with explicitly listed topics.  There are perhaps a few too many 
precious materials around --- once Conan gets to the tower everything is made of 
ivory, topaz, gold, sapphire --- but I guess that's just the in style when 
you're an all powerful priest.  I feel that a small amount of repair work on 
this game --- clueing one or puzzles a bit more, not trapping Conan in the room 
with the spider, a few bug fixes --- would remove the flaws and allow what I 
think is quite a good game to shine through.

Tales of the Traveling Swordsman is one of several games from the 2006 
Competition that I returned to recently for another look.  I enjoyed my second 
play-through just as much as my first, even though the game is not the sort that 
generally most excites me.  You see, Tales very much wants to tell you a story 
-- one particular story.  It is very linear, and implemented just deeply enough 
to get you through that story.  And it is a fantasy game, not my favorite genre 
of IF or literature.  The fact that someone like me, who is generally interested 
by more simulation-oriented, open-ended IF set anywhere BUT a world of magic and 
fantasy, finds the game so appealing is a testimony I think to just how well it 
operates within its chosen restrictions.

The game casts you as the eponymous swordsman, an adventurer who roams the land 
in search of villains to vanquish and fair maidens to rescue.  It proceeds 
through three linear episodes to a suitably exciting climax; then comes a 
wonderful little denouement that casts everything that happened before in an 
entirely different light and really makes the game for me.  The writing fairly 
charges along with lots of swashbuckling vigor right from the opening lines: 
"Thick blades of grass at hip level part and bend with your long strides. Onward 
you go, one hand on your broadsword's sheath, the other clutching a scrap of 
parchment, and your water flask dangling from the opposite hip. The town of 
Homesdale is now a morning's journey behind you."  Mr. Snyder also takes modest 
advantage of Hugo's multimedia capabilities to display some nicely-done 
scrollwork chapter titles that add to the atmosphere.  I hate to always refer to 
games by name-dropping books and other games, but in this case I can't resist.  
In the book department, this reminds me of a Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser story 
with a rather less roguish protagonist; in the game department, of a less 
aggressively silly Eric the Unready.

It does have plenty of puzzles, but they are quite straightforward and likely to 
stump you just long enough to make them satisfying.  You won't find any 
brain-twisters here to derail the story, and that's a good thing.  In fact, you 
won't find any of the things you might be used to seeing in next-generation 
titles by the likes of Emily Short and Eric Eve, or even the author's own 2005 
Competition entry <a href="d.html#distress">Distress</a>.

So why do I want to give this one such an excellent review?  In short, because 
the atmosphere is just so darn innocent and fun... and because at the end, when 
you realize what you have really been experiencing, it manages to be both very 
funny (especially the bit about the cat!), and poignant, a reminder -- for me, 
anyway -- of childhood summers that seemed to go on forever.  Without the 
epilogue, it would be a competent but unexceptional little piece of lightweight 
fantasy.  With it, though, it rises to mingle with the cream of the 2006 crop.  
I can't think of a better choice for the 2006 XYZZY award for best story.

I could happily go on for several more paragraphs, but to do that I would have 
to spoil the central surprise about which I've possibly already said too much.  
I have to say, though, that a huge source of confusion for me as I was playing 
the first time, the fact that I couldn't seem to TALK to anyone, gets explained. 
In fact, I realized on my second play-through that there was no sound at all in
the story, and, again, when you get to the end yourself you will understand why. 
I'm not sure if I'm quite happy with the point of view switch that happens 
inside the epilogue, as it felt a bit jarring to suddenly be somebody else after 
going all through the game through behind another set of eyes, but I'm also not 
sure if the real situation could have been communicated quite so economically if 
this hadn't been done.

The overall level of polish is excellent, bugs seem well-nigh nonexistent, and a 
play-through will take no more than a couple of hours at the outside.  So go to 
it, and if you have any heart at all prepare to laugh and even be a little bit 
moved.

VERSION: Release 2

A fantasy quest with a reasonably innovative spirit, Town Dragon is
well-intentioned but plagued by gameplay problems. Several of the
puzzles are painfully obscure, and others rely on examining things
that the game doesn't do much to bring to your attention--and others
require learning by death. A &quot;story&quot; file that the author provides is
virtually essential to understanding what's going on--not a bad idea,
and the story is nice, but it would be good to have it integrated into
the game a bit better. The writing is competent, but overly terse at
points when it would be nice to have some thorough desrciption (for
example, in a dragon's cave).

Despite the technical problems, the underlying story is fairly
effective, as IF fantasy stories go. There is a damsel in distress,
but rather than striding to her rescue, you let others volunteer while
you collect treasure--an amusing send-up of the brave selfless
hero. (Moreover, those that do volunteer are comically stupid, and get
carried off by the dragon in amusing ways.) Even then, the plot isn't
quite what it seems, and though the central motif feels lifted from
the Chronicles of Narnia, it works well enough here to keep the player
involved. The best thing about Town Dragon is that, particularly in
light of its fantasy setting, it doesn't reliably go where the
player's expecting; some of the subversions work better than others (a
maid who speaks Valley-Girl style--&quot;ya know?&quot;), there are signs of
originality here that belie &quot;another fantasy game&quot; complaints. And
some of the writing is quite good--there's a transformation scene
that's drawn out over about 20 moves and works very well.

This, in short, is a good effort that needed some testing. There isn't
enough in Town Dragon as it stands to overcome the technical problems,
but the author shows some promise; some more Inform experience might
yield a solid game.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag22.html">SPAG #22</a> -- September 15, 2000

The Annual Interactive Fiction Competition has added some notable titles
to the annals of the greatest works of IF ever. There are games like
<a href = "s.html#sunset">Sunset over Savannah</a>, <a href "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a>, and <a href = "b.html#babel">Babel</a> which are just as popular
today as when they were first entered in the competition. These classic
games notwithstanding, however, the annual competition is typically a
place where new authors can experiment with new game ideas and
programming languages on a small scale with a guarantee of roughly 20
reviews (at least that's been the norm of late). The Town Dragon by
David Cornelson is a traditional fantasy game from way back in the 1997
IF Competition that features a veritable plethora of fantasy clich&#233;s
surrounding dragons, kidnapped daughters, and corruption. It is
apparently a first time game for the author, one that unfortunately
suffers from a few game design mistakes that undermine the
well-intentioned plot and puzzles.

The goal of the game at first glance seems fairly simple and
straightforward: you must kill the town dragon and save the distressed
damsel, in this case the mayor's daughter. And, as is typical,
recovering the mayor's daughter is a bit more complex than walking in
through the front cave entrance and demanding her return. The problem
here is that even with a fairly small map, it's very difficult to get
focused on where you should be heading. There isn't much linearity in
the game, which is typically a good thing (in fact you can enter the
dragon's lair without facing any obstacles if you really want to) but
this lack of focus, and more specifically a lack of "markers" to guide
you, is actually a detriment to this particular gaming experience. I
found myself halfway through the game with a short inventory list of
items and no idea what to do next. The puzzles are not easy or logical
(although there was a nice bit with some mirrors) and there often is no
incentive for doing certain things that are apparently fundamental in
obtaining a successful outcome. Unfortunately, the game just doesn't
proceed either intuitively or reasonably from one section to the next.
You know you have to save the mayor's daughter, you just have no idea by
what means you should save her. 

The game has a fairly small time limit that's set up in a novel enough
way. You begin the game standing in a line of "volunteers" where one of
you has to put your foot forward to rescue the girl. The unlucky
volunteer who elects to save her will get killed by the dragon in
roughly seventy-five moves or so, after which the mayor spirits you back
from wherever you are to stand in the center of town with the rest of
the volunteers so that another volunteer can be chosen. Being whisked
away while you're in the middle of puzzling something out (like let's
say the mapping of one of the game's 2 mazes) was especially
frustrating, and broke up the flow of my thought process on many
occasions. This happens about 3 times after which you are automatically
chosen as the volunteer and you have roughly seventy moves or so before
the dragon comes after you. There are a few ways to prolong the dragon's
assault, but time really is of the essence here. You want to waste as
little of it as possible.

I got the impression while playing The Town Dragon that the author put
this piece together in relatively little time (which is true of many
pieces released during the annual competition). The writing is not the
greatest I've seen in a piece of IF, with many grammatical and spelling
errors (although, I believe these have been corrected in later versions
of the game). There seems to also be a problem with the way the words
flow, and the scenery descriptions seem disjointed in their structure.
Here is an example of a typical room description:

   South Road

   This road enters the town to the north and leads to a cavern to the
   south. There are rising cliffs on either side of you. It is rumored
   that a dragon resides in the cavern.

Not a big deal, but both pieces relating to the cavern could have been
put together I think.

The author does incorporate a good sense of humor in a few places
however, and a typical mimesis-breaking technique that the author puts
to good use occurs when the player tries to head in a direction where
there is no possible exit. Here was a typical (albeit longer) example.

   >ne
   You found a secret passage!!!

   [Your score has just gone up by one hundred points.]

   >Full
   You have so far scored 120 out of a possible 140, in 48 turns

   A group of interactive fiction auditors appear and begin tallying up
   your adventures.

   "According to our records, you were to have found a secret passage at
   some point and time. Hmmm...", one of them peruses various documents
   and looks up at you, "Nope. It was a hoax performed by the author.",
   and they all look at each other shaking their heads. "You'll have to
   return the 100 points given to you under false pretenses."

   The auditors gather up their paperwork and walk away....with of
   course, your extra 100 points, earning you the rank of Dragon Snack.

   [Your score has just gone down by one hundred points.]

This leads to a little brevity and also a little relief, as it's fairly
obvious that the author never intended the game to be taken too
seriously. Unfortunately, it also accentuates some of the problems with
the game. There are a few secret directional pathways to be found, and
the constant comments you receive about "not being able to read the
description sceneries properly" when moving in an inappropriate
direction provides the player with some negative reinforcement when it
comes to trying alternate pathways. There are similar problems with
alternative solutions to some of the easier puzzles. Why is it a certain
NPC will accept payment in one type of currency, but not in a more
expensive type of currency? Why is it physical deformities or important
articles of clothing that should be immediately visible on certain
characters take repeated searching attempts to discover? 

I had actually deemed the game unwinnable until I read another review of
the game in SPAG and realized that there was a built-in walkthrough I
could use if I wanted to. Having given up hope of ever solving the game
on my own, I used the walkthrough and I'm glad I did. In my opinion, the
game is unwinnable without it, and the intuitive leaps the author
requires the player to make are very unreasonable. Here's an example of
some of the "intuitive leaps" the game's puzzles depend on: The player
realizing that people like to take naps after they eat; the player
looking up something in a newspaper without knowing why, when the actual
action of reading the newspaper gives no clue that there's something
relevant inside it; non-standard Inform actions that have to be
initiated without any idea why. It's a real pity too, because through
all the jumble, there is a pretty good story in there somewhere and some
of the puzzles could be rated top notch, provided they were clued a
little better.

Unfortunately, as it stands, the guess-what-the-author's thinking
routine gets a little frustrating by about halfway through the game and
if it wasn't for the built-in walkthrough, I don't know if I would have
wanted to finish it. I'm sorry to say that as a result, The Town Dragon
is not recommendable.

VERSION: 1.6

To begin with I was quite impressed with Trading Punches. The opening
graphic gave it a very professional look that is rare in text adventures
these days and it seemed like I might be onto a real winner here. It was
also one of the first games I played in this year's Comp, which was also
a positive thing: finding a game of professional quality so early. Then
the game started and I became less and less impressed with it the more I
played.

Which isn't to say this is a poorly written game. It isn't. The location
descriptions are lengthy and nice for the most part, even if a little
overly excessive in their use of the language. This piece from the first
location was a classic example of excessive:

   Colorful peacrows relinquish their places in the few nearby elmpine
   trees, flying then across the open expanse, beyond the cabin, over
   the hills and away to regions unknown. Others arrive from the west,
   stopping for a moment to rest in the same few elmpines before
   continuing on a similar migratory route across the estate.

While interesting to read, it was too flowery for my tastes and I found
myself wishing for a shorter and to the point description. But that's
probably just me.

The storyline itself seems like a well-thought-out one for the most
part. A race known as the Sheeears seem to have taken over the world and
the human race are living uneasily alongside them. Your father is some
kind of ambassador of the humans with their dealings with the aliens and
this is a role you seem to assume later in the game. It's hardly a new
or original idea but it was nicely done and could have made for a very
interesting game, instead of a very frustrating one.

What quickly rid me of my initial feeling of being impressed with the
game is the way it practically forces you along the path it wants you to
take. Take, for example, the prologue to the game. You and your brother
Thyras are on a river bank. Thyras is throwing stones across the river.
On the bridge are your father and uncle deep in discussion about some
topic or other. The whole point of the prologue is to reach the stage
where a creature known as a dactyl attacks your father, but the way this
is reached is so poorly done you'll probably be aching to attack your
father just to hurry matters on a little. You have to find some rocks
and skip them across the river with Thyras. Several times. Simply
waiting around doesn't do the trick and neither are you able to talk to
any of the characters (or not in a way that I discovered anyway). You
just have to follow a series of set actions which doesn't make for a
very interesting game. Strangely enough, throwing the stones across the
river doesn't do the trick; you have to skip them. Apparently your
father and uncle don't want to start speaking in front of someone who
throws stones instead...

This being forced along a set path seemed to bog down the rest of the
game (or as far as I reached in the two hour time limit anyway) and
while Trading Punches had started off looking as though it might be a
modern classic, the feeling I had when I stopped playing was that the
writer, unfortunately, had become more concerned with the minor details
than the big picture. The second part of the game involves wandering
around a lot of very similar locations and filling several different
glasses from several different punch bowls then giving the drinks to
several different people. As far as puzzles go, this was a desperately
dull one and without the walkthrough to help me I'd have just quit at
that stage. I quit before too much longer anyway, as my initial
favourable impression of the game had become somewhat lost and I was
seriously struggling to keep my enthusiasm. Sometimes, even an
interesting storyline and a compelling writing style just can't compete
with mind-numbingly tedious puzzles.

Despite my misgivings, I think I'll probably return to Trading Punches
again at some point in the future as there's an interesting game here.
But it's one I suspect will require a considerable amount of patience to
get through.

VERSION: Release 9

Tod Levi's Transfer is straight-up science fiction with few real
surprises--the setting (research lab) and plot (experiment goes awry)
are well-used, and the execution incorporates most of conventional
science fiction's strong points and drawbacks. Still, it's entertaining
enough, and there are a few creative twists among all the familiarity.

You and the rest of your research team are trying to perfect transfer of
consciousness between entities, including across species--but the head
of the team seems to be dying. Mayhem ensues when the transferring
technology gets used and it appears that someone on the premises,
naturally, is up to no good. Most of the mayhem, actually, is your
doing--the other characters in Transfer are largely bumps on logs. Not
only is there minimal interaction with them, but they don't appear to
notice much of the havoc you wreak; evading their notice could have been
a puzzle in itself in several cases, but the game doesn't take that
opportunity. (Which makes the one instance when you're told not to
wander around in plain sight a little confusing--it's not necessarily
apparent why the characters who were blind and deaf a moment before
would be so alert now.) Worse still, the few things that they know about
don't appear to change much, if at all, over the course of the
game--they don't comment on the latest development, no matter how
bizarre or noteworthy, or even take notice of something fairly obvious
that' s going on right at that moment. To be sure, the characters are
important in the plot, and the plot is quite complex--but interacting
with them is rarely rewarding.

The main strength of Transfer is the gadget itself, and the variety of
ways you put it to use; the game could plausibly be considered an
extended riff on the central idea of identity-switching, in that the
idea gets used in unexpected (and occasionally hilarious) ways. The
element of the story that revolves around the machine is sufficiently
convoluted that one question in the hints late in the game is,
essentially, "Huh?"--but the story is sufficiently well crafted that the
complexity doesn't feel gratuitous. In this respect, Transfer is classic
science fiction: the gadgetry is intricate and fun to play with and it
leads the story in all sorts of unexpected places, often steamrolling
right over the characters, who end up (naturally) pretty flat. The
presumption, in other words, is that the player is more interested in
playing with the gadget than in plausible character interactions.

The puzzles are entertaining, if sometimes difficult--at various points,
the game leaves you wandering around the research complex with no clear
cues as to what you're supposed to be trying to do next. The most
egregious such example involves one point when you're apparently
supposed to intuit that because two separate documents mentioned the
same date, you're supposed to find out more about that date, thereby to
advance the plot. Fortunately, there's a comprehensive hint system that
helps bridge the gaps, and on the whole the puzzles make sense once the
necessary inferences are supplied. (Meaning that the inferences aren't
illogical, they're just obscure.) Also, the game doesn't become
unwinnable without warning, according to the author' s notes, and as far
as I can tell it never becomes unwinnable at all (aside from death,
which doesn't happen all that often)--there are virtually no meaningful
time limits, and no resources that you can waste. At times this strains
realism, of course--even when you're somewhere that you shouldn't be,
you don't need to rush to get your business done because no one's going
to interrupt you--and it takes the edge off any tension that might have
been produced. But for fairness and ease of play, it certainly works.

The writing, for its part, is competent, though it tends toward the
laconic: not only are there no exclamation points, but the game never,
as far as I remember, imputes any sort of emotion to you, even when the
emotion (e.g., fear when you're apparently about to die) seems pretty
obvious. The emphasis is more on conveying what's going on than dazzling
you with picturesque or evocative settings, though, and from that
perspective, things work fine, writing-wise--there are no errors that I
noticed, and the relevant information is always there. Likewise, the
technical aspect is strong: the various transfers are handled well, and
your interactions with the world in your various incarnations all made
sense, as far as I remember. The only real game design problem I
encountered was that something could be done in one move that I assumed
would take two, meaning that a puzzle solution was a total surprise to
me when I gave up and looked at the hints. That's a product of my
expectations more than a design flaw, though, and it certainly wasn't a
glaring weakness.

Transfer isn't particularly revolutionary, but it's one of the better
examples of its genre (a very crowded genre)--it brings more creativity
to the table than many of its fellows. While unabashed puzzlefests
usually aren't my thing, I enjoyed this one enough to give it a 9.

VERSION: Release 1

Laura Knauth's Trapped in a One Room Dilly is virtually the antithesis
of her <a href = "#travels">Travels in the Land of Erden</a> from the 1997 competition--where
that game was sprawling and filled with plot, Dilly is tight, focused,
and almost devoid of plot. But while this is probably a better game
than that one was, it has some deficiencies even as one-room games
go.

From the outset, Dilly more or less declares that it is forgoing plot:
the initial room description states that &quot;ou have no idea how you came
to be in this room or what you were doing just before.&quot; You therefore
commence solving puzzles that eventually allow you to get out of the
room--the title adjective &quot;trapped&quot; rightly suggests that being in
this room is a problem. What is missing, however, is a sense of
direction--you fiddle with the objects at hand, which eventually lead
you to a way out, but not in a way that could remotely have been
foreseen when you started fiddling.  (Whereas at the beginning of
<a href = "e.html#enlight">Enlightenment</a>, say, the entire concept is apparent from the beginning,
and the challenge is using the materials at hand to solve the
problem.) Dilly is therefore a fundamentally different sort of
one-room game than Enlightenment, or In the Spotlight, or <a href = "p.html#persist">Persistence
of Memory</a>--and while that's not a bad thing, it's a little less
plausible than more unified one-location games. As in, someone had to
put together this bizarre room full of objects that, suitably
manipulated, allow you to get out; why did they do that? To give Dilly
credit, one of the wittiest parts of the game is a bookshelf full of
made-up plots that could answer that question--alien abduction,
government experiments, etc.--but making a joke of it only underlines
the point: stories that could make sense of such a premise require a
strange, contrived plot, with the situation engineered by some malign
intelligent entity. Dilly works better, in short, when considered as a
set of puzzles thrown into one room, rather than as a piece of a story
that happens to fall within one location.

The mechanics of Dilly are not quite as elegant as they might be. The
room is evidently _crammed_ with stuff to play with--and though that
isn't bad, as such, the relative sparseness of Enlightenment suggests
that it needn't be that way. Very few objects in Dilly have multiple
uses, or uses beyond the obvious; there just happen to be a lot of
objects thrown into one room. Dilly could work as a two- or three-room
game without losing its flavor, so to speak; other games, where the
story or the atmosphere are tied into the one-room conceit, would
not. (Such as, say, Enlightenment or Persistence of Memory.) Dilly
might also be a little less confusing if it were more spread out;
there are so many knobs to turn and buttons to push in that one room
description that it is easy to lose something in the shuffle.

Still, let me be clear: Dilly is a well-done example of a one-room
game.  There are some inventive puzzles, particularly involving the
physical properties of common objects you run across and components
you can take out of larger objects. One change-the-environment puzzle
could be clued a little better, but it's a good puzzle
nonetheless. There are several points where you destroy or damage
objects rather than simply working with them, which I found somehow
refreshing: it meant thinking outside the lines, never a bad
thing. (Of course, it can break mimesis to require destructive actions
in some contexts--homes, public places, etc.--but this is not a
setting where such actions would be a problem.) Even the more
artificial puzzles--a dartboard that requires a certain number of
points scored, a "myriad" puzzle--are reasonably well-crafted; the
latter has some unusual patterns, the former adeptly uses the
&quot;practice&quot; dynamic also seen in <a href = "e.html#edifice">Edifice</a>. And there are nice
extras--there is a slot machine, and you can play it using coins you
find, though as far as I can tell it is impossible to win
anything. There are plenty of nice touches that help to alleviate the
sense that the author has grafted together a set of puzzles that
didn't fit in other games.

It's not clear what Dilly contributes to the genre of one-room
games. The author ruminated about the possibility of a full-length
one-room game, which may yet be possible--but, I would venture to say,
not the way Dilly does it, not with a room full of stuff and no
guidance given the player.  Much of the relevant material should be
hidden at first to avoid discouraging the player; more importantly,
objects should be involved in more than one puzzle each. Moreover,
goals and motivations should change during the game, to break up the
monotony of staying in one room the entire time. Nevertheless, this is
an intriguing effort, and I gave it an 8 in this year's competition.

OK, probably the first thing I should confess is that I'm not hip
enough to know what a &quot;dilly&quot; is. My handy dictionary suggests that it
means &quot;something remarkable of its kind&quot; -- their example is &quot;a dilly
of a movie.&quot; Somehow I don't think that's what's meant here. So,
judging from context, I'm going to assume that &quot;dilly&quot; means
&quot;relatively enjoyable puzzle game with good coding and writing, but a
few guess-the-verb problems and sometimes not enough synonyms
implemented.&quot; If this is what dilly really means, then Trapped In A
One-Room Dilly has the most accurate title of any game in the 1998
competition. Like many others in this year's competition, Dilly is
very puzzle-oriented. Perhaps what we're seeing this year is a bit of
a backlash against the periodically swelling outcries for &quot;puzzleless
IF.&quot; If backlash it is, I don't think that's entirely a bad
thing. Sometimes because literature has so much more cultural capital
than puzzles, we can get into a mindset which tries to shun puzzles in
favor of an elusive brand of literary merit. Don't get me wrong -- I
myself am much more interested in IF for its literary qualities than
its puzzles, but I also think it's important to remember that (for
some of us, anyway) there is also a pleasure in puzzle-solving, the
&quot;crossword&quot; part of IF as opposed to the &quot;narrative&quot; part. I believe
that interactive fiction can cover a very wide spectrum indeed, but
that there will always be a place for puzzle-oriented IF on that
spectrum, and I'll probably always enjoy a really well-done puzzle
game.

Dilly is the closest I've seen yet in this competition to that lofty
standard, but before I talk about the things it does right, I have to
take one step back and talk about a game from last year. The author of
Dilly entered a game in last year's competition called <a href = "#travels">Travels in the
Land of Erden</a>. Ironically, these two games could not be more
different. Erden was a sprawling, gigantic game with an enormous map,
any number of subplots, and a generally broad scope. When reviewing
that game, I wrote about the benefits of focus, and suggested that &quot;if
the author had concentrated her energies on a game perhaps a quarter
of the size of this one, she would have had time for much more
extensive proofing and beta-testing, and the result might have been a
tight, polished gem rather than the rough and gangly work she
submitted.&quot; Well, when I'm right, I'm right. Dilly benefits enormously
from having a much tighter focus than Erden. The game narrows its
scope to (as you might have guessed from the title) one room, and the
room is a really *interesting* room, full of enough gadgets and
gewgaws to keep me busy for two hours. At no time in Dilly did I lack
for something to figure out, look at, or do. The game crams about 10
puzzles into this one room, but it didn't feel particularly strained
to me. In fact, Dilly makes a sly gibe about its lack of plot by
including a bookshelf full of books whose plots are plausible
explanations for your situation (Intelligence testing, alien
abduction, the bomb shelter of a wealthy wacko, etc.). The puzzles are
generally creative and fun, and all of the coding and writing is
technically proficient.

Well, almost all. The only times I ran into trouble with Dilly were
when I was close enough to the solution of a puzzle that I should have
received some slight confirmation, but the game didn't provide it. For
example, at one point in the game something is ticking and
vibrating. If you listen closely to this object, you can hear it
ticking. However, if you touch it &quot;you feel nothing unusual.&quot; This is
one of those instances where after I found out what was happening, I
felt cheated. If I'm that close, I want at least a little nudge. In
another instance, I had more of a guess-the-verb problem -- the game
wants you to tie two things together with a rope, as in &quot;TIE FROG TO
LOG.&quot; (That's not really what you're tying, but I'm trying to avoid
the spoiler here.) However, if you first &quot;TIE ROPE TO LOG&quot; you get a
message along the lines of &quot;That's useless.&quot; If I had tried &quot;TIE ROPE
TO FROG&quot; first, the game would have picked up on what I meant to do,
but I didn't make that lucky guess. I don't like to be put in the
position of making lucky guesses. Nonetheless, these are relatively
minor problems, easy to fix. They didn't stop me from enjoying my time
in the one-room...  whatever it was.

Rating: 8.5

VERSION: Release 1

Travels in the Land of Erden is situated firmly within the tradition
of expansive heroic fantasy quests--and, to give it credit, it
inhabits that genre much more consistently than any other game in this
year's competition. (Yes, I do consider that a compliment. I like
heroic expansive fantasy quests. Done well, they have a certain
charm.) Though the gameplay has some problems, Erden is an enjoyable
old-style fantasy quest, too long for the competition but enjoyable in
its own right.

The plot is notable because it changes abruptly midstream--you start
out pursuing a dragon, but are told that the dragon has taken a coffee
break or some such thing and that your new brief is to track down a
lost jewel.  You don't seem to mind this--dragons are irritating
things anyway--and, truth to tell, it doesn't exactly affect the way
you go about the game, since you were only nominally pursuing the
dragon and you only nominally pursue the jewel. (I should note,
though, that there are several sources of information scattered
around, some in the form of characters and one an Encyclopedia
Frobozzica-type book, which do help make sense of things.)  What
_does_ happen is that you confront a whole bunch of puzzles, which
eventually lead to the goal, and whether it's a dragon or a jewel
makes little difference. Truth to tell, having a plot that is actually
sustained over the course of the game here would be difficult, because
this is a fairly long game, far longer than the average competition
entry. The game design is somewhat wide: much of the territory is
available at the outset, and figuring out exactly where to start is
something of a challenge, since there's lots of area to explore and
lots of objects to pick up. Even so, the exploration is well-done and
feels convincing, particularly a series of caves in the endgame;
disparage fantasy quests if you like, but this author put plenty of
thought and effort into making the scenery come alive. (At some key
moments, the author rewards solved puzzles with more territory to
explore; I wanted that to happen more often, but when it does happen,
it works.) With a clearer hook, something to push the player into the
plot, this would be a very effective story.

There are some clunky moments, gameplay-wise, though many have been
cleaned up since the first release. Most of the problems are
mechanical, though--the game is well-designed and avoids closing off
in unguessable ways, for the most part. In fact, it's virtually
impossible, unless you do something very stupid indeed, to render the
game unwinnable--most resources can be replaced, and there are no time
limits. There is one notable exception, a problem that still needs to
be cleaned up--one alternate solution to a puzzle that the walkthrough
suggests does not work (at least, not as far as I can tell), and if
you make that solution necessary, as it stands, you're in
trouble. That aside, though (and I'm sure it'll get fixed), Erden is a
reasonably player-friendly game.  (Moreover, there are some nice code
tricks--the author seems to have added a &quot;windy&quot; attribute for rooms,
for one thing, and a landscape transformation is thoroughly done.)

There are many nice things about Erden--the gypsy who looks into a
crystal ball to determine whether you've attacked or hurt anyone is a
hackneyed but nice touch. The writing is quite skillful, and there's
plenty of it--most rooms are thoroughly described, there are very few
grammar problems, and there's even a modicum of atmosphere,
particularly in the pirate-ship sequence. (Erden is proof positive
that well-written fantasy can still be absorbing.) I enjoyed the
setting on the island, and locations I might ordinarily consider
gratuitous were well-written enough that I didn't, in fact, think
that. And even though it gave rise to one of the more frustratingly
coded puzzles, the spell you cast is genuinely breathtaking, and the
author should get due credit for the idea. (And for the subtle effect
after the spell has worn off. Very few games follow logical effects
that way.) I enjoyed the puzzle in the dragon's cave--though figuring
out the proper syntax was, as usual, a challenge, and the required
action for getting there was a bit obscure. Finally, the on-screen
mapping works _very_ well indeed, and often helps considerably.

Given the level of antipathy to fantasy quests of this nature in the
IF community, I suppose Erden isn't for everyone; though there is much
to enjoy about it, it doesn't push the fantasy-game envelope
appreciably. But nor does it simply invoke fantasy cliches, and
there's nothing lazy about the setting (whereas laziness characterizes
the bulk of inferior fantasy games)--and while the plot could stand to
be better integrated into the story, there are enough clever puzzles
to keep this entertaining. Those that skip Erden because of its genre
might be missing something--and, if nothing else, the author shows
some promise.

HISTORY: This game was written in 1980 and revised in 1987.  It is
based on an article in BYTE 7/79 by Roger Chaffee.  The game has
been compiled to play, but the BASIC file is in the zip.  The BASIC
file explains the algorithm used and has instructions to change the
treasures and guardians.
 
PARSER: The reason I say there is not really a parser is that the
commands are limited to one letter:
C = carry (get); L = leave (drop); P = points (score); R = repeat;
I = Inventory; Q = Quit and the directions are N,S,E,W,U,D in the
simple game, adding F (Forward), B (backward) in the expanded game.
If you try to type something else, a help screen appears.
 
This would be a good game for a child who can read a little or to be
played with an adult to read the brief room descriptions and let the
child input commands.  The object is to find and return all the 15
treasures and pass through every room (100) in the fewest number of
moves, but there is no comparison.  You are asked for a game number,
so perhaps you can get the same game again.  This allows the game to
be played over and over with different locations and it might generate
a comparison for future games.  Those who abhor treasure hunts or
expect to 'save' and 'restore' should avoid it.
 
Each treasure is guarded by a monster and the weapons must be found to
vanquish each.  The guardians do nothing.  You are safe.  You cannot
die.  Well, if you do, the game will resurrect you with no loss.  You
do nothing.  If you have the correct weapon, C will work.
 
There are two hazards: a pirate will steal your treasure if you don't
return it to the Entrance soon enough and an ill wind will blow you to
a random location.  Neither is a serious problem.  The treasure will
be found somewhere and you can get oriented quickly.
 
It is not possible to write a solution since each game is different.
You can choose variations--limit to 3d, accept another dimension, etc.
In the simplest version, the directions are N,S,E,W,U,D and there are
few surprises.  This is the one I played.  I think the more advanced
versions might be more fun, but might take longer.  I finished the one
game I played in about four hours.  I decided a chart of directions
was more useful than a typical map.  I scored 100 points.

AUTHOR: Brian Moriarty          PLOT: Excellent
EMAIL:  ???                     ATMOSPHERE: Engrossing
AVAILABILITY: LTOI 2            WRITING: Excellent
PUZZLES: Logical & Satisfying   SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports

     Trinity is among the most popular of the classic Infocom
games.  After hearing friends and netters discussing their
uniformly wonderful experiences with Trinity, I finally decided to
give it a try myself.
     The game opens at London's Kensington Gardens, and quickly
takes off from there into a fantasy world of nuclear mushrooms,
giant children, and intelligent magpies.  The anti-nuclear message
of the game is clear but never overbearing.
     The parser is as brilliant as one would expect from Infocom; 
it is nearly impossible to produce an unexpected response.  Most
nouns have plenty of synonyms, and the player is never stumped by
how to phrase a command.
     Trinity's map is similarly user-friendly, with no tricky
surprises and few &quot;can't-get-there-from-heres.&quot; But the game's
strongest suit is its puzzles, which outdo what I've seen in any
other game.  All are logical and satisfying (except one...but you
figure it out).
     The endgame is somewhat difficult, but not overly so, and it
ties up loose ends very well.  Trinity has something for everyone:
it's not too hard for novices, but is well-suited for experienced
adventurers as well.  It is exciting, engrossing, well-written,
and, unlike too many other works of interactive fiction, lives up
to the hype.

And now, the cream of the crop, my ALL-TIME-NUMBER-ONE IF game...

Trinity is, without a doubt, the best IF game I've ever played.  I've 
been through it again and again just to read the text, which is something 
I cannot say about any other game except for <a href = "m.html#amfv">AMFV</a> and <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses</a>.  (Which 
right away lets you know that this game is in elite company!)

I can't really describe the plot without writing a vast essay, but suffice
to say that you're an American on vacation in London when World War III
interrupts the daily routine -- specifically, the city gets nuked.  You,
however, survive the devastation, with the help of a magical portal and
a strange voice inside your head.  Through the portal you will discover a
world of wonder unlike anything you've ever seen in interactive fiction.

The plot revolves around the stages of development and construction of the
atomic weapons used to destroy you in the game's opening.  Eventually, if
you are clever and utilize all of your brain cells to their utmost, you
might get the chance to go back in time and change history for the better.
The ending of this game is in my opinion truly spectacular, a fitting reward
for the amount of work you'll have to put in.  I was truly satisfied with
myself after completing this game.  There is one non-intuitive puzzle, 
which I solved by pure luck, but by and large the puzzles are very well 
constructed and quite logical.  They are also not so difficult as to 
seriously impede your progress through the story, which is the real 
emphasis of the game, but not so easy as to make you feel as though you 
are wasting your time.  A perfectly balanced challenge.

If you can at all get this game in the original packaging, do so.  There
are no game-critical items to be found therein, but the sundial is one of
the neatest props Infocom ever put out.  (Mine still adorns my windowsill.)
In short, if you play one IF game in your life, you would not go wrong if you
make it this one.  Highest recommendation.

Triune, by Papillon, begins arrestingly:

   This time, something snapped.

   You've seen the danger signs before: the stains on his shirt, the
   slur of his voice, the smell of his breath, the blood on his fists.
   He needs to hit something, hit it again and again until it breaks.
   When he's like this, he destroys the possessions that cost him the
   most to obtain. Whatever's left that still holds value, still holds
   meaning, still holds his place in this world.

   You are almost all he has left.

   You remember fleeing up the stairs, scrambling awkardly on teenage
   hands and knees in your haste, the thin fabric of your skirt not
   enough to shield you from the incipient carpet burns.

   You ran on bare feet down the hall to the bathroom, locking the door
   behind you, trusting in the spirit of propriety to keep your father
   from following you here, your last refuge.

   Because if he finds you, he's going to kill you.

Okay, wow. We have here a hell of a premise -- not a cheery one, no, but
it's pretty damn compelling. Almost instantly, I cared about the
character and about getting her out of this particular tight spot.
Unfortunately, this particular tight spot wasn't really the focus of the
game; the PC promptly jumps into a fantasy world with lots of stock
stuff like unicorns and castles and princes and stuff, which, initially,
I found disappointing -- if I have a real-life conflict, I want to do
something about it, not just think about something else.

To be fair, however, the fantasy world is more interesting than it
initially appears, and it's also related on many levels to the real
world. Specifically, the violence that appeared to be imminent in the
real world is present, in equally disturbing forms, in the fantasy
world, and some of the responses to the violence parallel (in the long
term, anyway) what the character might do back in the real world. It's
also worth noting that some of the responses are more than a little
violent in their own right -- there's a fight-fire-with-fire aspect to
the puzzle-solving. Still, the abrupt transition at the beginning of the
game sacrificed the game's hook, which is a shame because it was a
fairly good hook.

The gameplay isn't as smooth as it might be. The author entered a
CYOA-style game in the 2000 competition, and while Triune has a fully
equipped parser, I was occasionally reminded of the previous game. The
action has a way of happening in big chunks -- you do something that,
sometimes foreseeably and sometimes not, leads to an important scene,
but the scene flows by without any further chance for interaction,
almost as if I'd chosen menu option 1 and now had no further opportunity
to affect the scene. There's something to be said, of course, for not
giving an illusion of interactivity if you're not going to provide any
freedom; if what's going to happen is going to happen, there's a case to
be made for not taunting the player with the mistaken impression that he
or she can do anything about it. But that just raises the question --
why, in those scenes, are those results so inevitable from an early
point? Can't the point of no return be pushed back? There's also the
larger logical difficulty that the suboptimal endings address only the
endpoints in the fantasy world and make no attempt to resolve the more
immediate crisis in the real world. (Arguably, that's why they're
suboptimal, but the suggestions in the ending texts about why those
aren't the best endings don't cite that as a specific problem.)

Beyond that, the game's logic takes some twists and turns -- you're
likely to figure out before long that fantasy logic doesn't really
apply, but it's not exactly clear what logic does apply. This is partly
the product of the genre-jump; the player knows very well what his or
her motivation in the real world is, but has no idea what he or she is
supposed to be doing in this fantasy world, and to the extent that it's
not "do the usual fantasy things," things are a little bewildering. In
fact, this appears to be deliberate -- twice, you get sent on quests by
folks you meet, and each time completing the quest leads to an ending
which the game clearly considers suboptimal; the clues that you should
deviate from the quest in the precise way called for by the game, while
present, are a little subtle. On a third occasion, a character makes you
an offer, but accepting it leads to another suboptimal ending, so you're
supposed to reject it and solve a puzzle that's hinted at in one room
description (but which, natch, you have no independent reason to solve).
The story that ultimately emerges from all this is thoughtful and at
times powerful, but for me, it emerged mostly because the walkthrough
said to do this or that at certain times, not because of my
understanding of where things were supposed to go.

There are some more gameplay problems. At one point, you're imprisoned,
and you effectively get out of your imprisonment before your captors'
eyes without much of a protest. Lots of characters don't know much about
things that they should know about (or, at least, there's no obvious
reason for their ignorance). One puzzle solution doesn't initially work
but does later, and while there's a reason for the change, it's easy to
miss. Perhaps most importantly, it's largely impossible to put the game
in an unwinnable state, except by wasting a certain resource too soon --
and while resource-wasting is something that most IFers know to avoid,
it's not quite as obviously stupid as throwing possessions over a cliff,
and warnings might have been appropriate.

About that story: it's been called feminist-liberationist and such
things, and while that's not entirely inaccurate, I'm not sure it
captures the spirit. One of the suboptimal endings (and arguably another
as well), after all, is pretty close to a feminist utopia, and yet your
character doesn't seem wholly content. The game does label each of the
suboptimal endings with a female role generally seen as limiting by
feminism, but that just made things all the more puzzling for me, as the
labels didn't seem to fit what had actually happened in two of the three
cases. To be precise, the labels described what your character has
become, but not in an all-encompassing way -- your life as described in
the ending text was far from completely subsumed with/described by the
label, so it didn't seem quite fair to give those paths the conventional
feminist spin: "you live that role to the hilt and feel you're missing
something." That the other suboptimal ending is entirely consistent with
that same conventional feminist spin also suggests that the author
didn't set out to comment on feminism either (i.e., the game didn't seem
to be saying that there's more to these roles than canonical feminism
lets on). To add to the confusion, a few important characters who take
steps that track archetypical feminist liberation have thereby caused a
good deal of damage in the game's world -- is that unfortunate but
necessary, or does it mean that pursuing those goals is destructive, or
something in between (e.g., they pursued legitimate goals in foolish and
destructive ways)? Multiple interpretations are possible; my main
impression was that the game needed to get its theoretical house in
order. I should add, however, that a game with lots of ideas but which
doesn't manage to keep all its ideas straight beats a game with no ideas
every time, in my book, and I did enjoy trying to follow the conceptual
bouncing ball (even if I had to do it through the walkthrough a few
times).

The ending in the comp version elicited some protests; there was a
parser trick of sorts which closely resembled a similar trick from the
1996 competition, but which worked much better the first time. (Mostly
because the nature of the 1996 game in question was sort of silly and
gonzo, and the trick in question, I think, lends itself better to such a
game.) At any rate, the post-comp release changes the ending
significantly, but while it's certainly an improvement, I was still
rather unsatisfied -- not only does the new ending strain credulity a
bit (and assume away a lot of things), but it seems unrelated to
everything that's come before (one flaw that the original ending, if
nothing else, managed to avoid). The point is that, despite my initial
reservations, what went on in the fantasy world ended up being
sufficiently interesting that an ending that seemed divorced from the
rest of game felt anticlimactic, tacked on.

Oddly, this is largely a negative review of a game which I mostly
enjoyed -- it's well written, has some vividly rendered scenes, and some
compelling characters. As often happens, however, its strengths lay in
the ideas below the surface and in the questions it posed, and the game
itself (particularly the implementation) didn't quite live up to those
ideas. Triune could have been better than it was; as it stood, I enjoyed
it enough that I gave it a 7.

For the most part, I really enjoyed this game.  I thought that the
writing was quite well done and at some points I was really drawn into
the story.  It would have rated higher but it had no online help, no
hints, no walkthrough, and all I would get with help is the author's
email address.  Also, there were some rough edges, one being that I
had to type single words when mentioning the word to open the door and
talking to the horse.  But, when answering the riddles, I had to use
the say command.  It would have been better if the author would have
stayed consistent.

But, I would not have guessed that the author spent so long creating
the game based on the fine writing and the fact that the game worked
as I would expect.  It did feel a little odd in an old west setting
since I would not expect a text adventure game to have anything to do
with horses and ghost towns and mines.  But, even so, it was still
presented very well and I liked it.  Also, a definite plus was that it
was not that difficult, but there are many things that I would not
have been able to guess because of the inconsistencies mentioned
previously.

I thought that the idea of gum ball transformation was neat and I kept
hoping to find some more gum to take me to other places.  An amazing
amount of things could have been put into the game if one actually
would have enough time and willingness to program them.  The only real
major disappointment I had was at the very end.  It did not abruptly
come to a stop but more text (and more of an end game in general)
would have been nice.  It is like I had come all that way and done so
much and all I got was a gold watch and a thanks for helping out.  I
was also hoping to find more information about the woman that George
seemed to like so much that helped to open doors, among other things.
Too bad there were no new gum balls in his factory and I had to make
my own.  I could see a little bit of <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>, a small part of <a href = "#trinity">Trinity</a> and
some <a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a> in this game.

I played this game on a BBC micro several years ago, and I was impressed
by the neatness and complexity of the puzzle: I had a feeling of going
round and round on a complex Heath-Robinson mechanism that I had to
nudge a little bit each time it went round until finally I could step
off where I wanted.  I did my to best to capture this feeling in the
opening sequence of &quot;Christminster&quot;.

Not as sketchy as _<a href = "m.html#magictoy">Toyshop</a>_, and not as pedestrian as _<a href = "a.html#library">Library</a>_,
this entry still falls prey to the major shortcomings of both games,
to lesser degrees.  You are stuck inside the London Underground,
and must find a way to extract food from a run-down old vending
machine in a tube station.

Unlike _Toyshop_, _Tube_'s rather laconic style succeeds in much
the same fashion as _<a href = "e.html#enchant">Enchanter</a>_ at making the setting seem real.
Much of the tube station is left to the player's imagination to
fill in, but the setting is familiar enough, and the handful of
words carefully enough chosen to evoke the appropriate image from
the player.  Likewise, the vending machine looks and works just
like you'd expect.  Of course, relying on a shared experiential
context to fill in atmosphere is hazardous; players in rural areas
who do not normally encounter urban mass transit stations may not
have enough background to provide the needed imagery.

Unfortunately, the limited vocabulary and amount of interaction with
the NPCs (one of whom enters and then promptly vanishes before you
can interact with her at all!) turns a good portion of the puzzle
into a guessing game.  This entry may have been an attempt at the
&quot;sudden&quot; IF concept described in Whizzard's Supplement #1, but the
reduced set of possibilities that the author implemented jars the
player out of the tenuous sense of immersion that the writing creates.
Keeping words, locations, and objects to a minimum works if done
correctly; restricting the player's actions without providing a
reason why (beyond &quot;I don't understand ____ as a verb&quot;) doesn't.

No help at all was provided, and the author didn't include a
walkthrough, so I still haven't seen a fairly sizeable portion of
the game.  Combined with the rather circumscribed nature of reality
and the generally unexciting goal, that fact has kept me from wanting
to return to finish the game.  Authors of future entries that don't
implement help systems might want to keep that in mind and at least
provide a walkthrough.

BOTTOM LINE: Tightly written, but misses the train.

I should have been warned by Chris Forman's review of <a href = "z.html#zanfar">Zanfar</a> in Spag #8,
in which he points out that one author's trick to draw attention
to a game is to give it a name that places it last in the alphabet, so
that a person will always see it when doing a dir command.  I
downloaded 2112 for similar reasons; it is the first one listed in the
games/pc library at ftp.ifarchive.org.  I kept seeing it every time I went
there, had never heard a word about it from anyone, and thought I
would check it out.  Silly me.

2112 is based on a song by the rock group Rush.  It takes place in the
typical Orwellian anti-utopian future.  Since criticizing big
government is not as fashionable now as in Orwell's day, this
government is run by Priests.  The game begins with you finding a
guitar by the riverside, and taking this ancient relic of a forgotten
time to the Priests, who confiscate it since music is outlawed.  To
retaliate and let off a little steam, you go on a minor killing spree,
shooting the Priests, blowing up their computer (a la Captain Kirk!),
and making your getaway before the government is overthrown by space
aliens who destroy the city (possibly blowing away a few cops along
the way, although this is not required).  As a rock song, this is the
sort of thing that could inspire parental protests at the record
company.  The I-F player however would be better advised to protest
the quality of the game.

The parser is almost worthless; two words only, and no synonyms.  The
puzzles are strictly &quot;guess the word&quot; and &quot;struggle with the parser&quot;.
Actions are intended to be taken in a specific order.  Altering the
order can make the game very confusing.  One example: after you have
surrended the guitar, you are supposed to go to your home where you
will have a dream in which you see an old friend at the prison who
aids you in finding materials you need to win the game.  You will have
this regardless of whether or not you have already seen him and gotten
the aid.  People can talk to you (and even kill you) after they are
already dead, unless you have done everything in the right order.  In
some areas, you can still hear humming from the computer after you
have destroyed it; in others you can't.  There is a serious error at
the end.  Destroying the computer is also supposed to destroy the
electric fence, opening up a way of escape.  However if you arrive at
the fence on the turn that it is shorted out, the new passageway you
need will not be opened up at all, even though you can see the fence
shorting out.  Only if you are elsewhere on that turn will you be able
to get through the fence.  At least they can say that no playtesters
were harmed during the making of this game.

The atmosphere is heavily cliched, with lines like: &quot;...policemen of
the state lurk in the shadows.  I hope you are conforming!&quot;  I
personally think that the best treatments of the anti-utopian future
since Orwell were done by Patrick McGoohan in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and Terry
Gilliam in &quot;Brazil.&quot;  This one comes across as more laughable than
sinister, and presumably exists only so that we can shoot up the town
(the real point of the game) without feeling guilty about it.

There are some things to like about the game, however.  At key points
the game gives you a few bars of music from the PC speaker which help
to set the mood.  The game was not written with TADS, AGT, or one of
the other kits, but programmed from scratch, which is of course much
harder to do.  I confess that I'm not a Rush fan, and if I were I
might enjoy the game more.  At a couple of points in the game, stanzas
from the 2112 song are used in conversations by the characters, making
the game look like a little like a Musical (which is something I've
never seen in a text game before).

Still, the negatives far outweighed the positives.  Rush fans might
want to play the game anyway, but others are advised to give it a
miss.
