Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag40.html">SPAG #40</a> -- April 12, 2005

TITLE: Paint!!!
AUTHOR: David Whyld
EMAIL: me SP@G dwhyld.plus.com
DATE: 2004
PARSER: Standard
SUPPORTS: Adrift
AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/adrift/Paint.taf">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/adrift/Paint.taf</a>
VERSION: Release 1

Paint was originally intended for a one-room competition but that was
aborted due to a lack of entries. In fact, only two games emerged: The
Last Hour and Paint. You certainly couldn't find a bigger gap between
the two.

Initially, I thought that the one room concept would be impossible to
work with (as a writer) and surely dull to play (as a player). Where is
the fun in only describing events, characters and items in one room?
Where is the fun in not being immersed in hundreds of locations? Well,
<a href = "t.html#tohell">To Hell In A Hamper</a>, another one-room Adrift game, certainly showed the
quality that can be produced in a one room adventure. With Paint, I feel
there is a healthy second to such a benchmark classic.

The premise of the story is typical of David Whyld material. If you're
unfamiliar with his prolific work (and by prolific, I really do mean
prolific, with 30 titles penned using Adrift) then you'll find the vein
of comedy and silliness at its core. Personally, I don't really get
comedy in IF. It takes quite a lot to raise a smile or even draw forward
a laugh. So, for this game to have the money shot, it's definitely quite
special.

You are in charge of a crew of dozy painters who have to paint an
office. Yep, that's it. Sounds simple, right?

Of course not -- this is IF. As with other Whyld outings, we have an
array of traditional text adventure puzzles from the sublime to the
downright silly. This is tongue-in-cheek stuff and, unlike in some
games, it really works here. I think that is because the initial
scenario is plausible, credible and easy to imagine. It's madcap
nonsense and all the better for it.

From the start, and don't even try to pronounce your client's surname, I
enjoyed having a nosy around the office, looking out the window and then
telling my crew to snap to it with the work. All seemed sane until a
meteor crashed through the roof...oh, yes, it's that kind of game.
Interacting with your crew is vital in solving this game. They hold
items you require and answers that you need. Other characters also pop
in, including your client and a rather interesting female secretary.

I won't give too much away but you'll encounter the meteor very quickly.
From that point on it's one loony encounter after the other. I enjoyed
the game. The witch doctor was my favourite encounter en route to
completion. This is a tough game, but enjoyable, with enough clues --
some subtle, some less. I came across no bugs or parse errors.

A fun outing!

8/10

<A NAME="pantomime"><h2>Pantomine</h2>
From: Mike Snyder (wyndo SP@G prowler-pro.com)
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag44.html">SPAG #44</a> -- April 30, 2006

TITLE: Pantomime
AUTHOR: Robb Sherwin
EMAIL: beaver SP@G zombieworld.com
DATE: March 31, 2006
PARSER: Hugo
SUPPORTS: Any Hugo Interpreter or GLK Hugo
AVAILABILITY: Freeware
URL: <A HREF="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/springthing/2006/pmime.hex">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/springthing/2006/pmime.hex</A>
VERSION: Release 1.00

In the early morning minutes of October 1st, 2005, a list of IFComp entries (at 
the official IFComp website) showed 50 or so potential games. As titles were 
knocked off the list (probably because the authors never completed and uploaded 
them), the list dwindled down to 36. For those of us online at the time, it was 
an interesting thing to watch. Among those original intents, though, was Robb 
Sherwin's Pantomime.

Now released for Spring Thing 2006, it weighs in on the light side (considering 
the competition's focus on medium- to long-sized games). As an intended IFComp 
entry, this makes sense. From chatting with Robb at his Hugo forum, I know that 
it took much effort and some sleepless nights even to finish for the Spring 
Thing deadline. Even short and perhaps rushed, Pantomime is a solid game with an 
entertaining story.

In Pantomime, you live on Phobos, currently a moon of Mars, but soon to break 
apart into an orbiting ring of debris. It's the last place anyone would choose 
to be, even before the crisis. It's a world where cloning is commonplace, robots 
named after Unix commands are a man's best friend, and being good at chess is 
cause for embarrassment. This is a vision of the near future.

I've only played the beginning of one or two Robb Sherwin games prior to this. 
That's probably why my reactions bounced between "whoa. did he really say that?" 
and "wow. what's it going to be *next*?" Somehow, even if he's holding back, it 
doesn't *feel* that way. Aside from a few typos - probably the result of the 
hurried effort to meet the deadline - the writing is great. It flows better 
because it's more casual. It's not just *how* Sherwin writes - it's also *what* 
he writes: the insults between characters, the one-off jokes, the clever 
descriptions and bits of back-story. I usually cringe at coarse passages and 
lowbrow humor in a game, but that's part of what makes Pantomime so interesting. 
Sherwin seems to write it in a convincing, honest way.

Pantomime is what an episode of Futurama might be, if the script came from 
Cartoon Network's Williams Street crew and it aired on HBO after hours. The 
little censor that lives inside Robb Sherwin's mind has a freedom not given most 
other IF authors, save maybe Adam Thornton. I mean, if a wacked-out robot needs 
to sport a cloned copy of a male porn star's money-maker, Sherwin will work it 
into the story. And it'll be *funny*.

The game *is* meant to be funny. I think. It's sometimes tongue-in-cheek humor. 
It's *definitely* black humor, where the absurd and the macabre come together. 
It might be an allegory for some of today's issues, but if so, I didn't really 
get that. More likely, it's just a strange but fascinating story.

The puzzles aren't difficult (generally just a matter of figuring out what 
action to take to move things along), and inventory is almost non-existent. 
antomime is very story-driven. The most difficult bit may have been passing the 
spiked gate, but even that obstacle yields to some creative but simple reasoning 
(okay, okay - I solved it by blind luck and experimentation, but it made sense 
afterwards). Even the second-to-last confrontation doesn't require anything more 
complicated than following instructions and listening to the bad guy's diatribe. 
This should be particularly appealing to anyone who prefers IF to be more 
*fiction* than *game*.

A few minor bugs remain in the competition release. They range from typos to an 
odd exit back to Kangaroo's Club - nothing game-killing. This seems to happen 
more toward the end. What's most likely to work against Pantomime, though, is 
that it doesn't seem long enough for a Spring Thing game. It also glosses over 
the additional detail in most places, when it comes to interacting with (even if 
only to "look at") scenery objects. Knowing Hugo, I think this could be fixed 
easily, even without real objects. Just add an "extra_scenery" property to each 
room, with lists of keywords that will cause a different reference message. It 
means the difference between something "not there" when it really is, and simply 
being "unimportant".

A few plot points left me confused. Who sent me the vial? What was the purpose 
of the seemingly unnecessary gate code? And how drunk was Sherwin when he came 
up with the interaction that helps the PC escape the airlock? Other than that, 
everything is wrapped up tidily at the end, where a couple of fitting plot 
twists are thrown in.

I enjoyed Pantomime, and I recommend it - especially if an update comes after 
the competition. Without hints, I finished in two and a half hours (plus some 
re-play of select earlier bits). It's definitely a game that wouldn't have been 
out of place in the annual IFComp, but even snack-sized by Spring Thing 
standards, it's a worthy entry.

My Spring Thing score: "7"

TITLE: Pass The Banana

VERSION: Release 1

This disturbing study of a descent into madness is at once shocking and
sublime. Yes, the symbolism is all here: candles in a dark-paneled room,
a stage representing the subconscious mind with its flickering and
fragile consciousness surrounded by the dark sea of the subconscious;
the empty trophy case juxtaposed with the full junk closet, a
devastating portrait of lost hope and failed dreams; a flaming skull
alluding to nothing so much as Death caught in an inferno of alienation
pervading modern civilization and ultimately consuming it; a monkey, a
non-human animal so human in form as to mock our very identity as human,
symbolic of our animal needs and the animal lurking, always lurking just
beneath the surface of our rational facades; a robot, a machine in human
form, the ultimate symbol of our dehumanization at the hands of our own
cleverness; the plentiful seating, symbolizing man's inhumanity to his
fellow man; and, of course, the banana, so strident in its symbolism
that it paradoxically becomes subtle, like an angry couple at the
supermarket whose loud, pointless bickering we try to pretend not to
see. 

But even such powerful symbolism would be empty without narrative, of
which we find more than we can handle. We pass a banana, tentatively at
first, experimenting: to the monkey, perhaps, or to the robot? And what
about the flaming head? Soon we build confidence, just as the hero in
the prototypical mythological framework gains confidence from early
tests, and start passing bananas more aggressively. Before we know it we
are in a banana-passing frenzy - bananas everywhere, coming, going,
faster than we can keep track of, just as we lose track of things in our
daily lives: this banana an overdue bill, this one a friend we've lost
touch with, this one the wreckage of a marriage. And then it stops,
suddenly, and we find to our shock that we have no more bananas - but,
in a bitter indictment of western society's glorification of hoarded
wealth, this is how we win: just as the Japanese gardener considers her
garden complete only when she has removed everything that she can
remove, this game is not complete until we have no more bananas. 

Other games in this year's competition might have more plot, more
puzzles, or more elaborate settings, but none have more bananas. 

Score: 2 (there's nothing to it, but what's there works)

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag9.html">SPAG #9</a> -- June 11, 1996

 NAME: The Windhall Chronicles I: Path To Fortune
 PARSER: Inform's usual
 AUTHOR: Jeff Cassidy and C.E. Forman            PLOT: Spacious
 EMAIL: ceforman SP@G worldnet.att.net
 ATMOSPHERE: Well done
 AVAILABILITY: Shareware, IF Archive                    WRITING: Slightly uneven
 PUZZLES: From enjoyable to illogical            SUPPORTS: Inform Ports
 CHARACTERS: Static                              DIFFICULTY: Medium+

Path to Fortune (PTF) is the first in the Windhall Chronicles series.  In  
it, you play Aerin, &quot;a simple blacksmith's apprentice, nothing more.&quot;   
However, by a bizarre bit of reasoning on your village's part, you are  
chosen to save the village from taxation without representation by finding  
the treasure horde of Kirizith, a huge dragon.

The game begins with most of the world available for exploration, and the  
world is large and complex.  There are many places to explore and many  
puzzles to attempt, which helps if you are stumped by one particular  
puzzle.  It would have been nice had the game not shown its whole hand at  
the beginning; additional areas which you can explore only after solving a  
puzzle hold my interest more than being able to visit (almost) everywhere  
at the beginning.  There were only three areas I couldn't visit without  
solving a puzzle, and all three involved at most two rooms.  After enough  
tromping about Windhall, I was ready for something new to explore.  Of  
course, &quot;enough&quot; is a relative term--as large as Windhall is, it took a  
long time before I was familiar with it.

The open design of PTF weakened its plot somewhat.  At times I felt as if  
I were slogging through endless puzzles, marking time until I could find  
the dragon.  If you ask Denvil the elf about the fish dinner he wants you  
to supply, he says something to the effect that it is just one of those  
sub-plots adventurers are always fulfilling.  A lot of the game felt like  
that--sub-plots I had to finish in order to get to the dragon.  More  
direction towards the end goal was needed.

The initial puzzles' difficulty range from fairly easy to slightly more  
difficult.  However, as time went on, I found the puzzles becoming more  
and more illogical, possibly due to my solving the logical ones early on.   
The puzzle involving a werewolf and ogre locked in battle struck me as  
completely unmotivated, even after I was helped by someone who had already  
finished the game.  Too often I had to resort to the brute force approach  
of trying every object out on every other object; I would have much rather  
reasoned how to solve the puzzles.

The main strengths of the game, its size and number of NPCs, are also its  
main weaknesses.  Due to the size of the game and the number of NPCs, it  
felt as if none of the NPCs were fully realized.  The NPCs reacted to a  
large number of questions, but all were of the &quot;ask xxx about yyy&quot;  
category.  None of the NPCs had a life of their own.  Every day Baezil  
cursed over his unlit stove; every day Mielon and Idah stayed in their  
house.  There are an ogre and werewolf who are fighting to the death, day  
in and day out, for as long as you are willing to watch.  The NPCs could  
have been improved by having motivations of their own.

I enjoyed playing PTF immensely, the above nitpicks notwithstanding.  The  
game is an excellent addition to the growing pantheon of Inform games, and  
well worth the time spent.  I look forward to seeing the next installment  
in the series.

NAME:   The Pawn
AUTHOR: Magnetic Scrolls
DATE: Mid-80's?
SUPPORTS: See review of <a href = "f.html#fish">Fish!</a>
AVAILABILITY: Commercial (see above)

Ahhh, Magnetic Scrolls first illustrated text adventure and, like
Infocom's first official game <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>, is just about as famous unless you
lived in America in the the late 1980's of course, which is a pity.

The story: you have been bushwacked on the way home from shopping at
the supermarket and you wake to find yourself in the land of Kerovnia.

Things aren't all gold and cheese in the land of Kerovnia though, and
you find out why later.  The game starts off by not telling you what
you are supposed to do, and you only find this out by talking to
everyone you meet.  The characters you get to meet are a colourful
bunch, Jerry Lee Lewis (yes, yes, the one and only), Kronos the
Wizard, a horse with no legs, Honest John and a bloody irritable
princess.

The parser is quite good but has its niggles. Especially in reference
to English and some objects.  The most noticable bug is the &quot;white&quot;
one: you have in your inventory &quot;you are carriny a white&quot; which turns
out to be a white light.  Kinda dodgy and should have been picked up
in bug testing.

The puzzles are very crafty and logical.  Hands up those of you who
got stuck trying to move the boulder!

{ This review was previously published in _Intelligent Gamer_, which
  explains the slightly different format. It is included here with the
  author's permission. -- MO }

A couple of things about this review: please remember that it was
written in 1994, before I knew anything about TADS [the Text Adventure
Development System], which was used to create the game.  I touted a
couple of the features in PF as being very unique, such as the ability
to dump a transcript of the game to a text file.  Of course, that's a
standard feature of all TADS games, but I didn't know it at the time.
Also, at the time I reviewed it, the game was still commercial.
Obviously, the comments about the game's copy-protection and all of
the game's &quot;included goodies&quot; don't apply to the freeware version.  I
am leaving them in the review, however, because the final rating the
game received was due in part to its extensive Infocom-like packaging.
Even without it, though, this game is well worth a look, especially
for FREE!

   &quot;I'm too young to die....&quot;        
        
It has been said that man's greatest journey is the one he makes at
death, and with good reason.  People have always been fascinated by
what lies beyond our &quot;mortal&quot; world, and the book and film market have
been quick to capitalize on this interest.  Even the computer gaming
industry has explored the concept, much to the delight and surprise of
many gamers.  More than one recent game has allowed players to explore
the afterlife, including Sierra's King's Quest 6: Heir Today Gone
Tomorrow, which offered would-be adventurers the chance to see the
Realm of the Dead, complete with eerie background music and
frightening graphics.  Now, California-based software publisher High
Energy has taken a look at the afterlife (with tongue firmly
in-cheek,) and death will never be the same again.  Let's face it: any
game which opens with the message &quot;*** You have died ***&quot; can't be all
bad!  Quite the contrary, in fact: Perdition's Flames is a marvelous
adventure game, and the best way I've yet found to explore Hell
without leaving the comfort of my own home.

As the game begins, the player's soul is drifting down a river on a
yacht, along with several other newly deceased people.  The player is
free to wander around the ship, have a few drinks at the bar, chat
with the crew, or just enjoy the scenery.  This opening sequence is a
fantastic way of familiarizing yourself with the &quot;feel&quot; of the game.
Wander around and enjoy the atmosphere.  Get used to being dead.
You'll find out that it's not terribly different from the life you're
used to.  (Hmmmm. I wonder if that's significant.)

After a short while, the ship will arrive at a dock leading to the
Hell mainland.  Once you leave the ship, you'll find yourself in the
merry land of Hell, which is quite a bit different than most of us
have been led to believe.  If the player wishes, he or she may attend
a welcoming seminar, during which various other new arrivals will ask
some hilarious &quot;newbie&quot; questions, and receive answers from the Hell
Welcoming Committee.

From the seminar, the player learns that Hell has decided to update
its image.  Gone is the &quot;Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter&quot; sign that
used to hang atop the main gate.  Gone is the eternity of damnation
and suffering that every church preacher in the history of the world
has shouted and sweated about in his sermons.  Now, Hell is just like
any other nice place to live, with shopping malls, suburbs, and a
Department of Motor Vehicles.  (Somehow, we all knew that Hell would
have one of these, didn't we?)

What if a soul is uncomfortable in Hell?  No problem!  People are able
to freely go back and forth between Heaven and Hell, staying as long
as they like in either place.  Transportation to and from Heaven is
accomplished via an enormous elevator in the middle of town, provided
one has a ticket.
             
   Just think of it as Sim-Hell...

Perdition's Flames (PF) features incredibly detailed descriptions of
rooms and objects.  Its text-only interface recalls the greatness of
Infocom (a software publisher from the late 1970s-late 1980s who wrote
many text- only adventure games), without resorting to some of the
shortcomings that were typical of even this mighty software giant.
For starters, PF is &quot;100% Certified Maze-Free!&quot;  For folks like me who
still occasionally wake up screaming in the middle of the night
because of <a href = "z.html#zork3">Zork III</a>'s Royal Puzzle, this is a heaven-sent (no pun
intended) gift.  True questers will also be relieved to learn that
it's quite impossible to get yourself in a position from which it's no
longer possible to win.  This was my only real gripe with Infocom's
games: all too often, if you didn't do something trivial way back at
the beginning of the game, you were unable to solve a puzzle much
later in your quest.  (The cheese sandwich puzzle from <a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's
Guide</a> comes to mind.)
       
   Hell on Wheels
       
Moving around Hell is easy: the player simply types in which way he or
she wants to go: &quot;Go north,&quot; for example.  More complicated sentences
are also allowed: the player may type something along the lines of &quot;Go
north.  Open the door then take the shiny gold coin.&quot;  Players can
keep track of the items they are carrying with the standard
&quot;inventory&quot; command.  One of the more unique features PF has that many
other games do not is the ability to dump a transcript of the game in
progress to a text file.  Infocom's classics allowed transcripts to be
dumped to a printer, so the tradeoff is a fair one.  Even some of
Infocom's more obscure commands like VERBOSE (turn on long descrip-
tions) are present (and welcome) in PF.  All in all, this game is
something I wouldn't be surprised to find on a hypothetical Lost
Treasures of Infocom Volume 3.

   Is it hot in here, or is it just me?

What makes PF stand out above the countless other text games currently
on the market is its wonderful sense of humor.  The game makes some
truly awful puns, pokes fun at everyone's notion of what Hell is
&quot;supposed&quot; to be, and generally keeps you looking forward to coming
back to Hell every time you have to leave the computer.  If the player
should find a pitchfork in a barn, for example, the game mocks: &quot;Now
if you only had horns and a tail, you'd own this place!&quot;  During your
welcoming seminar, the player discovers that it is unwise to try and
sue anyone in Hell because the Hell Judicial System is based on the
one in the United States, and it will take an eternity (literally) for
cases to come to trial.  And hearing the woman in front of you answer
questions in the Celestial Security Office will make you laugh out
loud, in the style of Douglas Adams' <a href = "b.html#bureau">Bureaucracy</a>.

PF was written using TADS (Text Adventure Development System), a
programming tool also published by High Energy.  TADS allows users to
write games that are of Infocom quality, and, if PF is any indication,
they ain't just whistling &quot;Dixie&quot; with this claim.

   &quot;I may be going to Hell in a bucket, baby...
    but at least I'm enjoying the ride.&quot; - Grateful Dead

PF's elaborate packaging is another way in which the folks at High
Energy software have summoned the ghosts of Infocom.  PF comes with a
handsome map, a detailed, well-written manual, a hint book, a
reference card, and &quot;The Official Tourist Guide to Hell,&quot; an
illustrated, side-splitting pamphlet that contains the game's
copy-protection, in addition to many amusing items of interest.

Let's talk about the quality of the game's prose.  Although
comparisons with Infocom are unavoidable when reviewing text
adventures, the prose of PF is elegant, often funny and immensely
enjoyable, equaling (and in some cases, even surpassing) many of
Infocom's works.  (It easily beats out the <a href = "z.html#zorktril">Zork trilogy</a>, for instance,
and is on par with Deadline or even <a href = "m.html#amfv">A Mind Forever Voyaging</a> in terms
of the quality, if not intensity, of its writing.)

I loved the non-linear nature of the game.  Although by neccessity
certain puzzles have to be solved before other puzzles can be reached,
the game is tremendously flexible.  You truly feel like you are
PLAYING the game, rather than being sent to Location A to get Object B
to take to Location C to exchange it for Object D, etc. (Indeed, this
free-style type of play is neccessary, since the game's goal is not
revealed to you until quite late in the adventure.)

Finally, I enjoyed the difficult *BUT STILL LOGICAL* nature of many of
the puzzles.  While many Infocom games had brain-twisting challenges,
the solutions were occasionally not very logical at all (I'm thinking
particularly of the two Douglas Adams games here).  There are two
great head-scratchers that particularly stand out in Perdition's
Flames: the Haunted House/Ring puzzle and the Lion-Headed Statue
puzzle.  These are two of the best puzzles I have ever seen in ANY
interactive-fiction game, in both implementation and originality.
Both of these obstacles were *very* difficult to solve, but in the end
the solutions made sense, and I felt a sense of accomplishment after
conquering them.

System requirements for the game are tough to reveal: the review copy
INTELLIGENT GAMER received from Michael Roberts (the author of
the game) didn't list them, but they seem to be just about as minimal
as you could expect.  The program uses a swap file to run on machines
with small amounts of memory, and a hard drive is recommended.  The
program ran equally well on my 286/12 and my 486/50.

RATING: 9.5 out of 10.  Perdition's Flames is an incredibly
entertaining game with an original premise, and would be a bargain at
twice the price.  Fans of text adventure games will not want to miss
this one.  If, however, you don't think you'll be able to see past its
lack of graphics, you should probably look elsewhere.

SUPPORTS: Z-code (Inform) interpreters

3 rooms, 2 characters, 8 tangible objects, and 1 joke; that's all that
there is to David Fillmore's 1999 offering Perilous Magic. Perilous
Magic is one of a growing number of 'bite-sized' pieces of non-COMP IF
that have become quite popular over the last year. 'Bite-sized' IF is
interesting in that there's usually one convention that's being pushed
or one joke that's being promoted and the games are typically finishable
in a few minutes. Often, these smaller games are a nice break away from
the bigger pieces out there that can seem more laborious than fun to
finish.

Perilous Magic takes place in the <a href = "z.html#zorktril">Zork</a>/<a href = "e.html#enchanttril">Enchanter</a> universe and is
entirely built around a historical reference from the accompanying
material in the Infocom game <a href = "e.html#enchant">Enchanter</a>. The game actually reminded me a
bit of the film Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, where the story
of Hamlet is told from the confused perspective of the aforementioned
bit players. With Perilous Magic, we look at a bit of Zorkian history --
specifically the misuse of a spell resulting in disaster -- through the
eyes of the person who caused the disaster. The puzzles are straight
forward and the goal easy to attain. The end result is amusing but alas,
even for 'bite-sized' IF, the game is a little too sparse with many
interesting options left untouched. 

Most of the problems revolve around not putting enough effort into
coding objects. As I'd mentioned previously, there are roughly 8
tangible objects in this game. 2 of these objects are Enchanter-like
spell scrolls that are implemented using Graham Nelson's source code for
<a href = "b.html#balances">Balances</a>. One of the spells is a stand-alone spell that can't be cast on
anything while the other spell can be cast on objects and people with
interesting effects. You can imagine my chagrin then, when I started
getting the dreaded non-default response, 'The spell fades and fizzles'
when I cast the spell on objects that were part of the game's scenery.
Considering the scope of Perilous Magic, it left me wondering whether it
would really have taken much more energy to implement a few creative
results. 

There were similar problems with the game producing too many default
messages for actions that should have had less than ordinary responses.
This was especially true in areas where I felt a good snarky comeback
would have been easy to come up with. I realize it's tough to come up
with good non-default responses for everything, but we're not talking
about a game the size of <a href = "j.html#jigsaw">Jigsaw</a> here. We're talking about 8 objects, and
1 NPC. Spells should never fade and fizzle in this universe and towering
stacks of paper, precariously positioned on the corner of your desk
should not be hardly movable when pushed. 

I know a few of you readers are probably asking why I'm being so tough
on Perilous Magic for its poorly 'padded' objects when it was obviously
intended to be nothing more than a small diversion and considering the
fact that a lot of smaller games are conceived of, programmed, and
released all in the span of an hour or two, and in those cases polish
isn't particularly important (take Speed IF for example). Well consider
this oddity: If you download the latest version of Perilous Magic,
you'll find that you've download version 10 (yes, 10) of the game. How
is it a game the size of Perilous Magic has been updated 10 times while
larger games like The Mulldoon Legacy and <a href = "e.html#enemies">Enemies</a> only need 3 or 4
releases? The point is that after 10 updates of a 3-room game, I expect
to see non-defaults for every action I can think of let alone the
obvious ones. If I try to squeeze my desk, jump over my co-worker, or
kiss my report something interesting had better happen in every
instance! Hmmm... that's going a little overboard (well actually more
than a little...), but I think you catch my drift.

Non-default problems aside, Fillmore seems to have promise as an author
because of his good sense of humor. In fact, Perilous Magic's INFO
section (much like in his '99 IFCOMP release) is as memorable as the
game because of it. Fillmore also seems to grasp the basics of
programming Inform well enough and even pulls a few neat tricks straight
out of the Inform manual including a little Microsoft Windows sound that
goes off when you get points (at least I heard them using Winfrotz).
Still, quirky sounds, a good INFO section, and flashy quotes can't
disguise the fact that their isn't much flesh on this skeleton and it
all left me wondering what might have been had Fillmore focused his
attention more on the game and less on the bells and whistles.

When you reference your IF heavily to the Zork/Enchanter series there
will always be comparisons drawn. The question is then, does Perilous
Magic successfully qualify as a new chapter in the wonderful
Zork/Enchanter anthology (like perhaps Nate Cull's game Frobozz Magic
Support)? Nah, it's more like an extension to an existing footnote, but
probably still worth the download if you have five minutes to kill.

How great an influence do the games of Infocom still have on today's IF?
Hard to say, but there must be some presence there if an offhand remark
in one of Infocom's manuals can turn into a game in its own right, as is
the case with David Fillmore's Perilous Magic. The joke in question was
a reference to a great fire--which, the manual said, was caused by some
bureaucrat meaning to cast the ZEMDOR spell ("turn original into
triplicate") but slipping up and casting the ZIMBOR spell ("turn one
really big city into lots of tiny, little ashes"). It's a cute joke, and
as long as you know the source, Perilous Magic is a cute game.

There isn't a lot more to it than that: you end up causing the spell
switch, and the whole thing's over in 15 moves. It's not flawless--it's
possible to render the main puzzle unsolvable by doing things in the
wrong order-- but there's not much wrong with it, either. The main
appeal of the game is in the humor: there are Infocom references
sprinkled here and there, and the wonder-what-happens-if-I-try-this
results are suitably amusing. There isn't really enough here to call
this a full-blown homage, but it's enough to capture the feel.

Perilous Magic is a short but reasonably entertaining effort that
suggests that IF authors and players have ridiculously good memories for
throwaway jokes in manuals published in 1984. As a game, it's nothing
special, but it's not a bad way to spend five minutes.

NAME: Persistence of Memory
AUTHOR: Jason Dyer
E-MAIL: jdyer SP@G u.arizona.edu
DATE: 1998
PARSER: Hugo
SUPPORTS: Hugo interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition98/hugo/memory">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition98/hugo/memory</a>
VERSION: Release 1.0

I can count the amount of works of IF set in wartime--that I know of,
at least--on one hand, and I wouldn't even need all of that
hand. There have been spy-thrillers that drew on Cold War assumptions,
but <a href = "o.html#once">Once and Future</a> is the only work to be set even partly on a
battlefield, other than Persistence of Memory. It's not obvious why;
after all, latter-day IF authors appear to be fond of grim, bizarre,
chaotic situations, and not many things fit that description better
than war. Persistence of Memory is an interesting spin on war IF,
though an extremely brief one, as well as yet another in a large
collection of one-location games in the 1998 competition.

The premise: you're a soldier in a nameless war against a nameless
enemy, stuck in a field with one leg on a land mine, with a
malfunctioning radio.  Unlike some other one-location games, the
puzzles are not available at the outset for you to find; rather, they
come to you, one by one, and you have a limited time to deal with each
one. The experience is consequently rather limiting; the game attempts
to make you feel powerless, and it does that quite well, with the
exception of one puzzle solution that breaks the &quot;powerless&quot; feel
somewhat (though there's a good reason for it). Among the obvious
ironies of the game is that the protagonist is forced to depend on the
inhabitants of the country he has been happily destroying, but the
game doesn't do as much as it might have with that idea.

Indeed, it's hard to say what Persistence of Memory is about, other
than the superficial plot. If your encounters with the natives are
supposed to be cathartic, or cause you to Rethink This Whole War
Thing, the text provides only oblique hints to that effect. One
message is that failure to communicate causes waste and destruction, a
point well made, but is that the point of the story? It's hard to
tell. Perhaps it's merely that certain experiences humanize an
otherwise faceless enemy--not all that groundbreaking an idea, but
then again just about any thoughts on war in the IF medium are new, as
noted. Whatever the underlying message, the story works well; the game
changes your motivations and thoughts effectively over its course,
from &quot;getting off this land mine&quot; to more complex goals not
necessarily centered on survival. Or, alternately, one could view your
motivations as still focused on personal survival even as you realize
the consequences of war upon the villagers, and your internal
conflicts are a product of your guilt. Persistence of Memory is
susceptible to a wide variety of interpretations; it is to the
author's credit that he doesn't fill in many of the blanks. The scene
is vividly described: one particularly well-done aspect involves the
various physical discomforts you encounter over the course of the day,
stuck in your awkward position, developing cramps and soreness and
becoming more and more thirsty. (On the other hand, the game doesn't
make as much as it might of your psychological discomfort.)

The puzzles themselves aren't particularly hard; most of the solutions
are fairly obvious. There are no multiple solutions. Indeed, it is
almost impossible to deviate at all from the main narrative path and
still complete the game, meaning that there is no replayability
here. That's not a major drawback, given the nature of the story--the
goal is less to challenge the player than to present some ideas--but
the small size of the game makes it likely that, just when the player
is settling into the character and the setting, the game ends, and
there really isn't much incentive to go back and try again. (The
message of this game and of <a href = "#photopia">Photopia</a>, for me at least: if you want us
to care about characters, make us spend significant amounts of time
with them.) To the extent this game works, then, it does as thought
experiment or as a statement about the nature of war; no one should
play it for the puzzles. That's not, of course, a bad thing. But, as
with Photopia, it isn't entirely clear that this story _needed_ to be
set in the IF medium to be effective; this one has somewhat more claim
to interactivity than does Photopia, since there _are_ problems to
solve, but it does lay a rather linear path. The one-room aspect
reinforces that; more so than in the other '98 one-room entries, the
premise is a limitation, a confinement, and you the player do actually
feel confined. That sense of limitation pervades the game and
constrains the available experience considerably.

The Hugo game engine is up to the task, though the task, technically,
isn't all that much. The game does handle one action not easily
translated into IF-speak quite well, though, accepting a wide variety
of syntaxes and synonyms. Moreover, the WAIT command is altered for
the occasion: time passes until something of note happens, rather than
1 or 3 or 10 turns.  This proves very handy, though the player might
find the game unspeakably boring if he or she does not realize that
the action comes to the character, rather than the character producing
the action. This and other functions are handled quite well; the hint
system is minimally necessary but thorough nonetheless.

Persistence of Memory does, I think, what it was trying to do: it's a
short piece of IF set in wartime that raises complex questions of a
soldier's personal responsibility and the needless loss wrought by
war. It does all that reasonably well, enough so to merit a 7; it
doesn't, unfortunately, work quite as well as a game.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag17.html">SPAG #17</a> -- May 10, 1999

NOTE: Because of the nature of Persistence of Memory, it's difficult
to talk about it without revealing a key secret. Therefore, be warned
that any and all of the following review could be considered a
spoiler.

Memory is a new twist on the one-room game. The setting is war; could
be Korea, could be Vietnam, but it's never really specified, and it
doesn't really matter. It's a war in a foreign land, with villages,
dense foliage, helicopters, rifles, and land mines. Especially land
mines. In the first move of the game, you step on one, and realize
that if you remove your weight from it, it will explode. Thus the
potential paths which the game appears to have at its outset are
reduced to one: wait. This restriction of freedom is a recurring theme
in Memory. In incident after incident, the scope of action contracts
until it becomes clear that there is only one action which will lead
to your survival. Sometimes these actions are rather horrifying, but
the game demands them if you wish to finish. I have mixed feelings
about this kind of forcible plotting. On the one hand, it makes for an
extremely linear game, and it curtails interactivity quite
dramatically. This obstruction seems to fly in the face of the
conventional wisdom about IF -- it violates one of the Players' Rights
in Graham Nelson's Craft of Adventure: &quot;To have reasonable freedom of
action.&quot; In Nelson's words, &quot;After a while the player begins to feel
that the designer has tied him to a chair in order to shout the plot
at him.&quot; On the other hand, I also think that interactive fiction can
be a very good medium for conveying a sense of futility or
entrapment. Because IF by its nature seems to require at least to a
certain degree freedom of movement and action, and because it also
creates a sense of immersion in the story's world, when a piece of IF
chooses to violate that perceived requirement the player's sense of
identification with the trapped character can be very strong
indeed. Something about the frustration of having so few actions
available to me which would not result in death made the equation of
my situation with the character's feel more intense than it would have
were I just reading a story about this character.

Because of the game's premise, you don't seek out the puzzles; the
puzzles come to you. And each puzzle must be solved if the character
is to survive.  Luckily, all of the puzzles make sense and have
intuitive solutions, though in some of them it's not clear what the
deadly moment is until it arrives, and sometimes I found myself
resorting to a save-and-restore strategy in order to defeat a puzzle's
time limit. I don't think I could have solved the game straight
through, because some puzzles had rather unexpected and uncomfortable
solutions. This is where I found myself ill at ease with the game's
lack of interactivity -- there's a fine line between identifying with
a trapped character versus simply feeling trapped into an action
because the designer allows you no other choice, even though more
options might have been available in reality. It's hard to explain
without revealing more spoilers than I already have, but some pieces
of the plot felt rather forced, as though only one solution was
provided because only that solution would create the game scenario
desired by the designer.  However, the choices worked in the end, and
I found I only needed to look at the hints once, and in retrospect I
think I probably could have avoided that had I spent more time on the
puzzle that was stumping me.

The writing could get a little histrionic at times. Some descriptions
tiptoed along the line between what works and what doesn't. For
example, the mud around your feet is described as &quot;torpid&quot;, a word
which usually refers to a sluggish mental state. I suppose the mud's
thickness and viscosity could be compared to slow mental processes,
but it's a stretch.  There weren't too many moments like this -- for
the most part the prose did a fine job of conveying the situation, and
in fact sometimes was quite good indeed. The description of the hairs
rising on the back of your neck as you try to conceal yourself from
enemy soldiers was chilling and engrossing. I found no technical
errors in the writing, nor in the code. Overall, Memory does a very
good job with an unusual choice of subject matter, and when it was
over I felt not triumph, but relief. I suspect this is what the game
intended.

phantom/Phantom.z5</a>

An example of an unsuccessful attempt at the genre. You play an archeologist
trying to find the burial place of a legendary Egyptian warrior. Most of the
game, you just wander around, collecting artifacts for non-obvious purposes. I
expected them to become more clear later, but in vain -- said artifacts didn't
affect the outcome of the story in any way, only reflecting themselves in the
number of points I received. Although the author demonstrated intentions to
inject atmosphere into his work, and to sorta build up tension towards the
finale, the results turned out to be pretty pathetic. To a no small degree,
this was the fault of the writing, and the many spelling mistakes.

Phantom failed entirely as a representative of the horror genre, and hardly won
any points back even as a puzzlefest. Most of its puzzles could be subdivided
into two categories: (fairly generic) mazes (there were three of them), and 
"choose the right option or die". It seems the author invested a lot of work
into making up intricate clues for the second ones, and believed them to be
fairly challenging. However, he overlooked the fact they could be solved by
brute force (pick option -- die -- undo -- pick another option -- repeat until
solved).

I don't want to offend anybody, but, speaking in F1 terms, this is the Minardi
of our today's race.

Ever wanted to see &quot;<A HREF="s.html#cardigan">Space Aliens Laughed at My Cardigan</A>&quot; on the
Z-machine?  Here it is.  Enjoy.

The scary part is that the author seems to know what he (she? it? none
of the above?) is doing -- the writing is for the most part
gramatically correct and game is not as buggy as &quot;Cardigan,&quot; with the
exception of some screwed-up directions and incomplete direction
lists, which almost appear to be intentional.

It's every bit as incongruous as the great Andre M. Boyle's work,
though.  One minute you're in Ancient Mayan Ruins, the next at the End
of the World.  Add a series of blatant, gratuitous rip-offs (the needle
in the haystack from &quot;<A HREF="n.html#nord">Nord and Bert</A>,&quot; the llama food and Restaurant at
the End of the Universe from Douglas Adams' works) that don't fit in at
all, and some thoroughly motivationless, illogical puzzles -- I'm
guessing that NO ONE figured out how to use Leo the lemming to scare
away the moose worshippers, right? -- and you've got a great contender
for absolute rock-bottom last place.

Perhaps &quot;Phlegm&quot; was intended as a satire of the likes of &quot;Cardigan&quot; and
&quot;<A HREF="d.html#detect">Detective</A>&quot;?  If so, it ultimately fails because there is no discernable
difference between the parody and the parodied.  Good for a number of
cheap laughs (particularly Leo), but unlike &quot;<A HREF="k.html#kissing">Kissing the Buddha's Feet</A>,&quot;
few of them are genuine.  The title itself is also misleading - I found
no phlegm anywhere in the game.  The author must have forseen all these
problems.  His/her/its/whatever's name is left off the credits.  Wise
choice, friend.

VERSION: Release 1

"Photograph" is a vivid, professionally well-written and competently
programmed work. It is story-based and nearly puzzleless, but manages to
carry the player through the plot at a comfortable pace, without
dissolving into the tedium that sometimes characterizes pure-story IF.
There are things to do, problems to solve, and each project serves to
drive the plot. Occasionally, though, the prodding feels a little too
blatant, as if the player is being bounced from point to point (need to
eat, need to sleep, etc.) with bits of story in between.

"Photograph" is a rather dark character study, reminding one of
"<a href = "r.html#rameses">Rameses</a>" from two years ago. It is the story of a man who fixates on a
single "wrong turn" in his past, only to find, in the end, that the
hollowness within him runs deeper than he knew. What most raises
"Photograph" above the ordinary is the rich symbolism with which it
embellishes this tale, particularly the use of Egyptian mythology. It
skates the thin line between over-blatant and over-obscure, occasionally
erring towards the former, but usually just right. One is left with a
host of questions and intriguing ideas, especially regarding the
parallel between the Akhnaten dream and the fate of the protagonist (a
parallel reinforced throughout the story by subtle and not-so-subtle
means).

Akhnaten stands on the shore, awaiting the boat which will take him to
the afterlife. Belatedly, he wonders if it was wise to reject the
Egyptian pantheon in favor of Aten. But then he reaches under his robe
and finds a cavity where his heart should be. This "doesn't auger well
for [his] meeting with Osiris (the weigher of hearts).".

Consider the protagonist, who also made a decision that he later
regretted, and blamed that decision for the hollowness that grew within
him. Yet when he gets a chance to go back and take the other branch of
the fork, the epilogue describes a man who dies just as lost, just as
empty. Akhnaten worried that his choice of deities might bar him from
the afterlife, only to find in himself a deficiency so severe--a hollow
heart--as to render the question moot. Perhaps Jack's deficiency is also
pre-existing.

This is but one of many lines of thought to follow. Another would
explore the symbolism of the picture frame. Is it, as the final lines
suggest, a shriveled organ, waiting in a jar for the boat of Ra? Was
Jack's mistake in fixating on this frame--this single deciding moment in
his life--to the exclusion of all else, much as Akhnaten threw away the
richness of the Egyptian pantheon in favor of his pet god, Aten? But on
the other path, Jack makes the same mistake of fixation: he gets
swallowed up in his work.

Whichever way you approach it, "Photograph" is irredeemably fatalistic.
The protagonist seemed doomed from the beginning, by his own nature, to
lose himself. I can't agree with such fatalism; nevertheless, the work
is too rich and thought-provoking not to love.

VERSION: Version B

If there was a prize for &quot;competition game most mentioned on the
newsgroups before the deadline had passed,&quot; Photopia would win hands
down. Everyone was quite courteous about it, spoiler warnings and
rot13 and all that, but there was a marked impatience to talk about
this game, recommend it to other people, make it the test case in any
number of arguments. There is a reason behind this impatience:
Photopia is an amazing piece of work. It's also very hard to talk
about without giving spoilers away, so please forgive me if I'm a
little vague in my language. One of the most brilliant aspects of the
game is its plotting. It has what Adam Cadre, in an unrelated
discussion, called a Priest plot, named for writer Christopher
Priest. I don't know if this is a term that Adam just made up, but
it's a useful term nonetheless. It refers to a plot which just gives
you fragments, seemingly unrelated to each other, which coalesce at
(or towards) the end of the story. When the fragments come together,
and you figure out how they relate to one another, the result can
often be surprising or revelatory. When they came together in
Photopia, I found the revelation quite devastating. I won't say too
much more about this, except to say that it wasn't until the end of
Photopia that I realized what a truly incredible, powerful story it
is. It's the kind of thing where when you've played it all the way
through once, you can then replay it and all the pieces fall into
place, everything interlocking from the beginning in a way you can't
understand until the end. I think that this is the game that opens new
frontiers of replayability in interactive fiction -- I needed to play
through Photopia twice in order to see all the text again, knowing
what I knew after the end of the game.

Actually, I hesitate to call Photopia a game, but not because it
failed to live up to a standard of interactivity. It's just so
patently clear that Photopia is not interested in puzzles, or score,
or some battle of wits between author and player. Photopia is
interested in telling a story, and it succeeds magnificently on this
count. Unfortunately this deprives me of the use of the word &quot;game&quot; in
describing it -- perhaps I'll just call it a work. In any case, it's a
work that anyone who is interested in puzzleless IF should try. At no
point was I even close to getting stuck in Photopia, because the
obvious action is almost always the right one -- or else there is no
right action and fated events occur with heavy inevitability. Oddly
enough, this creates a strange contradiction. I was on ifMUD looking
for a word to describe the plot of this work (I couldn't think of the
phrase &quot;Priest plot&quot;) and someone said, jokingly, &quot;linear.&quot; But
actually, that's true. Despite the fact that it's completely
fragmented, and despite the fact that it jumps around in time, space,
and perspective, Photopia is a linear composition. There's only one
way to go through it, and the player has little or no power to make it
deviate from its predestined course. I think the reason that this
didn't bother me, that in fact I *liked* it, is precisely because
Photopia isn't a game. Because it is a story, the emphasis is taken
away from a teleological model, where the player tries to steer for
the best outcome. Instead, you're really just along for the ride, and
the ride is one not to be missed.

Now, this is not to say that Photopia may as well have been a short
story rather than interactive fiction. In fact, it takes advantage of
the capabilities of the medium in some very inventive and almost
unprecedented ways. One of the foremost of these is its use of color
-- each section of the game (oops, there's that word again. Make that
&quot;the work&quot;) is presented in a preset color, and these colors also play
a part in the Priest plot. I understood their function by the end of
the piece, and once I understood, I knew exactly why they were there
and how much they enhanced the storytelling. Unfortunately I found the
colored text a little hard to read at times, especially the darker
colors on a black background, but I wouldn't go back and play it in
blue and white. The colors, like everything else in Photopia, worked
beautifully, adding artfully to the overall impact of the story. The
work is interactive in other important ways as well. In fact, in many
aspects Photopia is a metanarrative about the medium of interactive
fiction itself. Again, it wasn't until the end of the story that I
understood why it *had* to be told as interactive fiction. And again,
to explain the reason would be too much of a spoiler. I have so much
more I want to talk about with Photopia, but I can't talk about it
until you've played it. Go and play it, and then we'll talk. I
promise, you'll understand why everyone has been so impatient. You'll
understand why I loved it, and why I think it's one of the best pieces
of interactive fiction ever to be submitted to the competition.

Rating: 9.9

[Disclaimer: what follows is my own opinion, as always, but it is also
distinctly a minority view. For other views on Photopia, the reader is
advised to consult Deja News, or alternatively to read Paul O'Brian's
review in this issue.]

There is no denying that Adam Cadre's Photopia is a well-written,
engaging work of fiction. (Well, okay, somebody probably will deny
it. But it won't be me.) It tells a powerful story in well-crafted
prose heavily seasoned with implicit allusions to other works, notably
Russell Banks's &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (and Atom Egoyan's film
thereof), and Carl Sagan's &quot;Contact.&quot;  (The power of the story,
incidentally, derives in part from figuring out its nature and
structure, and hence I won't go too much into detail here.)  It
skillfully uses multiple narrators to tell its tale, and carries
themes and images throughout that help give the story life. In short,
it's an excellent work of fiction.

SPAG reviews works of _interactive_ fiction, however, and the
interactivity quotient in Photopia is slight enough that it would
arguably work just as well as a short story. Graham Nelson wrote
several years ago of linearity in game design, noting that the player
comes to feel that &quot;the author has tied him to a chair in order to
shout the plot at him,&quot; and Photopia suffers in that regard. No one
would complain of having the plot shouted at him in a short story; the
nature of story-based non-interactive fiction is that the author
dictates and the reader absorbs. But the genius of good IF is that the
player shapes the development of the story, even if the author has a
certain end in mind; choices that the player makes affect the text
recited at him in a material way. Admittedly, many games throw in the
towel with rudimentary or nonsensical plots that serve as excuses to
cobble together puzzles--the victory of the crossword over the
narrative, in Graham's terms. Photopia represents the opposite, and
less explored, extreme, with no puzzles to speak of--and though there
is more to chew on here than past &quot;puzzleless IF&quot; efforts such as &quot;<a href = "i.html#end">In
the End</a>,&quot; the result, for me, was just as unsatisfying.

It should be noted that the game does not simply ignore idiosyncrasies
in the way you play the game; many choices are accounted for. Notably,
one choice regarding whether you bring along a certain object or leave
it behind is particularly clever and well-written. But the result is
that the game achieves precisely the same result-- your &quot;choice&quot;
affects the beginning of one paragraph. (The minimal changes in the
text highlight the noninteractivity; it's almost as if the author were
seeking out ways to keep the player from changing the course of the
story. There is an obvious purpose to that in this particular work,
but it puts a major crimp in the interactive aspect.) The difference
may seem to boil down to quantity rather than quality--the amount of
text that the player's decisions affect--but quantity matters: it can
mean the difference between the player feeling like he has actually
experienced the events described and feeling like he has watched a lot
of text scroll by. Adding to this effect is the sheer amount of stuff
that often happens between inputs--or, in other words, the amount and
type of unforeseeable events that your actions produce; again, it's as
if an existing work of fiction were translated to the IF
medium. Photopia's invention of plastic geography--the player in some
instances may travel in any direction, but the direction chosen will
always lead to a certain location--makes the world seem larger than it
is, and while it does that very effectively, it once again lessens the
player's impact on the story.

Another experiment that the author attempts ends up cutting off the
player from the story even more, namely the conversation trees: rather
than ASK/TELL, the player types TALK TO [character] and is given a
short list of topics (1. TELL PRESIDENT CLINTON ABOUT IRAQ, 2. ASK
PRESIDENT CLINTON ABOUT IMPEACHMENT, or 0 to say nothing). This is, of
course, a matter of taste, but I found the conversation trees the
least successful part of Photopia, because they completely destroy
what illusion remains of interactivity. In one sequence, your
character explains the basics of solar radiation, planetary accretion,
gallium production, and other astrophysical phenomena; it is _very_
hard, unless the player has ample background in astronomy, to avoid
the feeling that you are watching a conversation unfold, not
participating in it. I don't think it's impossible to give the
character more knowledge than the player is likely to have, and then
have the player act on that knowledge. But that requires more
development of the character than Photopia affords: the player's
involvement with the character is so brief that there is no time to
warm to the part before the character starts rambling about the
inverse square law. It is undeniable that the scene plays an important
part in the story; it is also arguable that identifying the explainer
of astrophysics as &quot;you&quot; heightens the emotional impact. But that
scene and others like it give Photopia the sense that the
&quot;interactive&quot; element is only a thin veneer over the &quot;fiction&quot; part.

It is possible that more extensive conversation trees, encompassing a
broader variety of topics relevant to the conversation might help;
perhaps future games will answer the question. Having severely limited
conversation topics is not essentially different from ASK/TELL with
only a few subjects available, admittedly. But most games that
implement ASK/TELL do not put words in the player-character's mouth to
the extent that Photopia does, and leaving to the player's imagination
how he or she would have phrased a question keeps the admittedly
clunky interface from breaking mimesis excessively. In other words,
the presumed advantage of conversation trees, that they give the
character more natural speech (one question in Photopia spawned by
TALK TO is ASK ALLEY ABOUT HOW I SOUND LIKE HER DAD, which no parser
could handle, rather than something like ASK ALLEY ABOUT DAD), assumes
that the player actually imagines the character grunting out curt
questions. But it ain't necessarily so; it certainly ain't for me.

Finally, though Photopia in many ways does what it does brilliantly,
it doesn't do it for very long; one has to be a very, very slow reader
to play a game this short from beginning to end longer than 20 or 25
minutes.  Of course, the player can replay, but he or she will shortly
discover that, as noted, the course of the story alters hardly a whit,
no matter what the player does. This is, of course, a personal
reaction: I can hardly say categorically that the brevity of Photopia
waters down the emotional force when the game clearly had considerable
emotional impact on many. (On the other hand, the two other people I
have prompted to play it were likewise underwhelmed--and I did not
tell them my own thoughts on the game until afterwards.) It is
possible that the story's major twist would be more effective if there
were more preceding it, more time for the player to get to know the
characters. (I also thought the game overplayed its emotional hand a
bit--exaggerated a certain character's traits--but that can be, and
has been, argued.)

Technically, Photopia is outstanding--the abovementioned textual
changes, even if brief, are woven in seamlessly to preserve the
story. A variety of changes in text color didn't work for me when I
tried the colored version on WinFrotz, but clearly the colors worked
fine for others. The conversation trees, whatever their merits, work
just as they are supposed to; the experiment with plastic geography
works brilliantly from a technical standpoint. Many other small things
indicate that the game was exhaustively coded, never a bad thing--for
example, examining a certain NPC while playing different roles yields
a variety of perspectives. There are many other little things that are
done well--transitions between scenes are particularly well done; the
first sentence of each section of the story recalls the last sentence
of the previous one, often in illuminating ways. But Photopia stands
or falls on the player's reaction to the story, and my reaction, for
whatever reason, was tepid enough that I gave it a 7 in the
competition.

Few works of IF have caused as much of a stir as Adam Cadre's
'Photopia', the winning entry in the 1998 Interactive Fiction
Competition. It is certainly vastly different from Cadre's last
creation, the raunchy comedy I-0. It is a short, puzzleless, literary
work which packs a powerful emotional punch, despite some
shortcomings.

The primary interest in Photopia is its structure - it makes the
fairly simplistic plot seem much more complex than it actually is. The
game jumps back and forth through the chronology of the storyline,
leaving the player to mentally piece together these 'vignettes'. The
different scenes are linked by different colours - red, green, blue,
and so on. These transitional passages provide some truly magical
moments.

The very first scene in the game involves a pair of drunken 'fratboys'
(an Americanism, I assume) and a car. Following this scene, we are
immediately thrust onto Mars, taking control of 'Wendy Mackaye, first
girl on the red planet'. This dramatic juxtaposition is confusing at
first, but ultimately makes sense in the scheme of things (I won't
spoil it for those who haven't played it yet).

The story revolves around Alley, a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth
sweetie with an extremely precocious grasp of astro-physics. The
player, throughout the game, plays the roles of various characters in
the story - including her mother, father, a young girl whom she is
babysitting, and a smitten teenage boy - but never Alley herself. The
wide variety of angles from which we see Alley partially makes up for
the fact that she is a relatively one-dimensional
character. Beguiling, yes, but perhaps not as believeable as she could
be. And the astro-physics? In an conversation with her father, the
young Alley - a toddler at this stage - is given an impromptu (and
very lengthy) lecture in 'inverse square law' and 'gallium
production'. All very impressive, but a little over-the-top.

These points, however, still don't dull the sheer emotional impact
when you realise how the story ends. And because of the work's
ingenious structure, this realisation actually comes around the middle
of the game - and of course this will vary from player to player. The
clever part about this design is that the game still continues even
when it's obvious what the eventual outcome is.

Ironically, structure is also the game's main downfall. The player has
no real control over the story at all. This is not a problem in
itself; in fact, all interactive fiction relies on the 'pick a card'
principle - that inevitably the player will choose the author's path,
with the number of choices available giving the illusion of
'interactivity'. It's hard to explain why this didn't completely work
for me in Photopia, but I could never escape the feeling that I was
merely a passenger on the ride. It is not really interactive fiction
in the traditional sense, but I must say that this does not alter the
effectiveness of Photopia as a *work*.

It may seem like I've been terribly harsh on this one, but when a work
of IF has been hailed as 'literature' by the rec.arts.int-fiction
crowd, it's only fair that it's judged on a similar level. And, at the
end of the day, I enjoyed this immensely. It's certainly one of the
most groundbreaking works to have appeared in ages, and will generate
vigorous debate for some time to come.

I personally wouldn't have given this game first place. This isn't
sour grapes, having entered a game of my own, but due to the fact that
the game never really grabbed me. The first scene doesn't have any
puzzles at all, although the multi choice conversation thing was
clever, the usual way you never know what NPC's are going to
understand. The second scene has a simple puzzle of find an item, and
bring it back to a location. Although it had a clever thing where by
which ever direction you went, the next location was created there,
I'm not sure how this was programmed, but I imagine it could be quite
complicated. A lot of people probably missed this entirely. The third
scene, had restrictions on movement that really got my goat, saying
you don't have a compass, so can't use the compass directions. This is
where my patience ended, and I gave up, the game being too fiddly to
play. The rest might have been really good, but I will never know. The
narrative to puzzles ratio seemed very large, i.e. too much text, and
too few puzzles.

And sometimes, well, the game just matches the title perfectly. The
tone of Phred Phontious is relentlessly silly, so much so that several
of the puzzles are quite difficult because they require offbeat
thinking rather than simple logic. Though the premise is far from
original, and though there are plenty of flaws, there is still plenty
to enjoy here -- if you don't mind some dreadful puns.

The setting is fantasy, sort of, but more joke-fantasy than
Tolkien-fantasy; this is the sort of fantasy that allows for things
like photographs and coffee and chainsaws. The plot is typical of
fantasy, though, even though it's a joke here -- you have to hunt down
the ingredients to a pizza, and deliver it safely. Along the way, you
encounter a dragon and a vampire -- along with a gnu and a crazed
dentist, of course. The layout is sufficiently unencumbered by sense
that all sorts of things can sit side by side, such as a spice mine
(why not?), a dragon's lair, a haunted cemetery and a travel
agency. Obviously, Phred Phontious is not trying particularly hard to
convey the scene or draw you into the world it describes; the player
may safely register the given stock situation, figure out the twist,
and never bother to try to visualize anything. The result is, while
enjoyable for a while, oddly forgettable; I found that I could hardly
recall the details of the game just hours after playing it. (The silly
place names -- Thikk Forest, Idubeleevinspukes Cemetery, etc. -- don't
help.)

Implementation-wise, Phred Phontious needs work. One significant
object is hidden in a scenery object that barely gets mentioned,
another important object is never mentioned at all, an enemy notices
your hiding place under one set of circumstances but not another --
though it would be just as easy to spot you -- and another fellow goes
on addressing you or preventing you from doing things even after he
falls asleep. Other objects act _very_ illogically -- a rope in this
game has some unexpected properties, and another object embedded in
scenery must be dislodged by an action that I never would have
guessed. At another point, you find yourself in a hole and are told
that &quot;it looks uncertain whether you'll ever make it out.&quot; Is the
challenge to find some creative means of getting out? No -- just
finding the right syntax. There are other things, illogical bits that
didn't slow down gameplay but still left me wondering -- for instance,
the character brandishing a key next to a locked cage, except that the
key doesn't unlock the cage -- the cage is irrelevant to the game --
but rather a gate far far away. There is a bottleneck right at the
start of the game -- you have to discover a hidden closet, but the
game gives no hint that it's there.  Elsewhere, you have a few turns
to search certain scenery and get an object; if you don't find it
then, the game closes off.

Even amid gameplay problems, though, there are some memorable moments
-- and even if the setting is clumsy more often than not, the author
does manage to send up fantasy conventions in amusing fashion now and
again. Two puzzles hinge on dreadful puns -- I, personally, enjoyed
them, but then again I have a weakness for these things, and I don't
advise that the author do this in the future. The way you get rid of
the dragon is reasonably creative, and the gnu-milk puzzle -- the
first part of it -- is clever, even if distasteful. And the endgame is
quite rewarding, though made more difficult by the requirement of
random scenery searching; I enjoyed the puzzles in the endgame more
than any in the game. Though there are coding problems aplenty
associated with the puzzles, many of them have excellent ideas; with
some more time and attention to programming difficulties, the author
might produce a first-rate -- and very challenging -- game. (One
puzzle I never figured out: a &quot;last lousy point&quot; that's a clue from a
British crossword.)

Phred Phontious is large, hardly finishable within two hours unless
the player relies heavily on the walkthrough, and the game both
encumbers you with a lot of objects and limits your inventory
severely. Perhaps the most welcome thing about the endgame was that
the goal was clear and the territory to explore limited; there was no
question of wandering around looking for the right object only to find
that the solution actually turned on a bad pun. Moreover, the endgame
is the only area where the room descriptions come alive -- and they do
for a very obvious reason then, of course, but it does make things
more vivid. And even though it's predictable, the ultimate ending
does, somehow, feel satisfying -- no &quot;to be continued&quot; messages or any
such thing.

This is a game for the puzzle fan, in short, specifically the puzzle
fan who likes to see fantasy sent up and doesn't mind some incoherence
in the setting. Though the player should save often -- the game closes
off without warning -- Phred Phontious is one of the few competition
entries that I found enjoyable despite serious flaws, and I gave it a
6 on the competition scale.

TITLE: Pick Up The Phone Booth And Aisle

When several regulars of rec.arts.int-fiction got together and decided
to do yet another parody of Pick Up The Phone Booth and Die, they
decided to also parody Sam Barlow's <a href = "a.html#aisle">Aisle</a> while they were at it. The
result is one of the most side-splitting things to ever be uploaded to
the IF Archive. Not only do we see the two games mentioned above being
ripped to shreds, there are more inside jokes than you can shake a stick
at. This has <a href = "s.html#sins">Sins Against Mimesis</a> beaten hands down.

Basically, you find yourself in the town square with the phone booth
from the original Pick Up The Phone Booth And Die. However, you quickly
discover that like Aisle, this is a one-move game. You have exactly one
move to do something and then it's over. However, unlike Aisle, it
doesn't loop back to the start. You'll have to restart the game by
typing restart or undo and try something else. It's too bad that they
couldn't have done it like Sam Barlow, but that's the only flaw in what
is supposed to be a big joke. Anyhow, every time you make a move, the
response is totally off the wall. Nearly all Inform actions are handled,
and there are few default responses to be had. Most of the responses
bear no relation to each other, so forget trying to make a story out of
it. The point is to have fun and I did. However, there is one set of
responses involving a particular object that are related and I had fun
trying to get them all. For a starter, try >INVENTORY.

Here are a few of the responses to illustrate what I mean by inside
jokes. I've cut out the restart/restore/quit prompt and the initial
description since they never change.

   >kick booth
   The booth's eyes widen as you draw your foot back. "Terry, no,
   please, oh God you can't--" Its cries are cut short as your foot
   slams into it. With the sound of eggshells cracking, the booth
   fragments into countless pieces which are quickly lost in the mud.

       *** You have quit smoking ***

   >smell
   You inhale deeply, smelling for the background scent of this
   particular location. It smells like broth... no, wait, is that
   tortillas?

   There are 56 fellow MIT students in there already, but one more and
   you get the WORLD RECORD. You somehow squeeze between Misty and

So, only if you know something about the history of Infocom, a bit about

The bottom line is that an IF veteran who is looking for something to

A newcomer to IF might not understand a lot of the jokes, and if you've

This game is a short one-joke game with a single puzzle. (And the joke
is not very much in the style of "Pick Up the Phone Booth and Die",
which I advise you to play first.) What to say about the game? Well, the
game is quite accurately done. That is, it gives sufficient answers to
player actions, without visible holes in implementation, or missing
descriptions. But the wild psychedelic charm of "Pick Up the Phone Booth
and Die" is not there! The only puzzle of the game is not bad, however
-- and the game has been written to demonstrate the puzzle, I suppose. 

Completion time? From several seconds, to several minutes.

Resume: If you like short-puzzle-one-idea games -- try "Pick Up the
Phone Booth and Dye". It's worth the tiny bit of your time you'll spend
on it.

Now here's a real dilemma.

First, let me congratulate the author on a number of things:

        1) The switching of tense - from first-person past in the
           introduction, to first-person present in the main framework,
           to an omnipresent third-person tense for a sub-&quot;plot&quot; - is a
           very ambitious hack of the Inform grammar.
        2) I thought it was quite imaginative the way you divided one
           &quot;room&quot; into six different &quot;locations.&quot;  A neat map twist.
        3) The &quot;Outer Files&quot; parody.  ROTFL!  Glad to see a fellow X-
           Phile writing I-F.  The truth is out there.  Trust no one.
        4) I was delighted to see the words of evil Professor Elvin
           Atombender of Epyx's &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; pop up.  Even ten
           years after the fact, I can _still_ hear that digitized voice
           perfectly, and it never fails to give me a nostalgic shiver.
           That was a GREAT game!  (And companies today think crap like
           &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; can hold a candle.  Hmmph.)

Now some (hopefully) constructive criticism:

        1) Typos.  Particularly in the revised default grammar messages.
           Lots of missing periods, misspelled words, missing line-
           feeds, etc.  Double-check these the next time around.
        2) Try to give your entry a little more plot and consistency.
           This year we've seen a lot of entries - &quot;<A HREF="#phlegm">Phlegm</A>,&quot; &quot;<A HREF="r.html#rippled">Rippled</A>
           <A HREF="r.html#rippled">Flesh</A>,&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="o.html#forms">Of Forms Unknown</A>&quot; come immediately to mind -
           where plots have been thrown out completely in exchange for
           wandering from one situation to the next.  These get old
           after awhile.  The drawn-into-a-book subgame is not as
           polished as the T.S. Eliot scene in &quot;<A HREF="c.html#curses">Curses</A>,&quot; and most of
           the rest feels like excerpts from someone's private life
           that I'd rather not know a lot about.  Most of the
           situations make no sense, even under the guise of drug-
           induced hallucination.

TITLE: Pirate Adventure
AUTHOR: Alexis Adams and Scott Adams
E-mail: msadams SP@G msadams.com
DATE: 1978
Parser: Scott Adams (2 word)
Supports: Originally custom format, since reverse engineered and translated to 
Z-code and others
Availability: IF-archive
URL: <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/adamsinform.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/adamsinform.zip</a>

I'm playing using the zcode translations of the games found in scott-
adams/games/zcode/adamsinform.zip in the IF Archive.

Pirate Adventure uses a split-screen style where the top portion of the screen 
is permanently given over to displaying the location description ("I'm in a Flat 
in london" [sic]), the available exits, and the visible items.  I remember, from 
way back when, that when I was playing this game on a VIC-20 the split-screen 
effect was quite convenient; the VIC-20 had a text display of 22x23, and games 
rarely implemented scrollback (since memory used for scrollback would eat into 
the memory used to hold the game description, all of which had to be kept in 
RAM).  So it was actually quite nice to have the equivalent of LOOK permanently 
displayed.  These days the split-screen effect is more disturbing; I often use 
long windows so my focus keeps having to shift from where I'm typing (at the 
bottom) to the room description (at the top).  Many commands (eg GET SNEAKERS) 
have no response, they simply update the room description. This change is 
sometimes easy to miss, especially if it happens in one's peripheral vision or 
during a saccade.

Needless to say the writing is extremely economical, but that doesn't really 
excuse the mistakes that are all too common: its/it's confusion, missing 
punctuation, and misplaced capital letters.

Parsing is two word.  LOOK IN SACK and PUT THE TORCH OUT are way too complex.  
Forget the luxury of having synonyms or helpful hints from the parser.  A 
typical example that crops up early in the game is that there are stairs in the 
initial location, but neither UP nor DOWN works, GO STAIRS being the required 
invocation.  In the location at the other end of the stairs, DOWN works to 
return to the first location.  Is Adams just being stubborn here?  Or is he 
introducing the player to the required mechanics to solve later parts of the 
game?  I think I'd rather give Adams the benefit of the doubt here and say that 
requiring players to use GO STAIRS instead of UP is getting them to practice a 
puzzle in simple and obvious form so that later on less obvious uses for GO X 
can be introduced without the player thinking it harsh or unfair.

The parser abbreviates all words to 3 letters and this somewhat makes up for the 
lack of now traditional abbreviations such as X (EXA) and I (INV).  Despite the 
parser's simplicity it does implement automatic disambiguation for some objects. 
CRA is recognised as "Sack of crackers" or "narrow crack" as appropriate, 
similarly with WIN.

When we review an old game like this we are confronted with questions of 
purpose.  Why are we playing an old game?  We can play to gain some insight into 
the history, to see what it was like to play games of that era (although the 
experience will of course fall short because of the lack of context, just as 
attempts at, say, medieval cooking do.  That doesn't mean such attempts 
shouldn't be made of course); we can play to see what value such games hold now, 
as objects of entertainment; finally, we can play to see what value such games 
hold for the creators of modern works.  What lessons can we learn from this 
game?

As a form of entertainment there is really very little to keep the modern player 
at the keyboard: no lavish descriptions; a fair number spelling mistakes and 
similar signs of inadequate proofreading; no cunning plots; the puzzles aren't 
particularly deep.

It's worthwhile to compare the implementation of a bag in Pirate Adventure with 
how it would likely be implemented today.  Today it would be implemented as a 
container.  The player would be able to open it, close, take things out, put 
things in.  Adams avoids the complexities inherent in container objects 
(capacity, inclusion in self, description of contents, reaching beyond when the 
PC is inside, etc) by simply having OPEN BAG create a new object in the location 
with the response "Something falls out".  Adams has been spared the expense of 
implementing containers, and the player has been spared the pointless 
exploration of a containment simulation.  In the modern approach, implementing 
the BAG as a container, OPEN BAG would yield the response "Revealing an X" or 
similar, and GET X would get the object in question.  Adams solution has all the 
elegance of the modern implementation, but at a fraction of the cost (in terms 
of programming and debugging).  In either case the player types exactly the same 
sequence of commands, OPEN BAG. GET X.  What the player has lost is the ability 
to PUT X IN BAG (that would require a preposition in the parser), but that 
doesn't seem like a huge loss given that containers in adventure games are often 
used to merely delay the player in finding some object (that is, they are a 
barrier to getting some object from the container rather than something into 
which the player might usefully stow an object).  The lesson here is that 
simulation for simulation's sake is pointless.  If you implement a complex 
object then its complexity should be motivation by having an interesting purpose 
in the game.  One recent example which fails this test is the implementation of 
pockets in Eric Eve's competition release of The Elysium Enigma.  The effect of 
the pockets was to hide from the player objects carried by the PC (a false, and 
I suspect largely unintentional) widening on the player / PC gap).  I'm happy to 
say that Eric Eve has  made a new release which fixes this and brings this 
aspect up to the high quality of the rest of The Elysium Enigma.

Structurally the game follows the classic trinity of beginning, middle, and end. 
 The beginning consists of 5 locations in the London flat and lasts until the 
player discovers how to get to the islands.  The middle bit provides most of the 
game and takes places on an island with rather more than 5 locations (though you 
will also be revisiting the flat).  A final section (on another island) is 
reached after the solution to a key puzzle on the first island.  The 
anticipation of solving that key puzzle is quite good and solving it yields a 
genuine sense of achievement which is sadly deflated by the game's very 
lackluster response: "CONGRATULATIONS !!! But your Adventure is not over yet... 
" (that's Pirate Adventure being prolix).  When Pirate Adventure was first 
published the three-part structure had yet to become time honoured; Adams did 
well to note that the theatrical device could be employed here.  Sadly the final 
part of the game is a bit of a let-down.  Like many games (modern and old) it 
feels like the author ran out of time, steam, or implementation space, 
consequently the final part feels under-implemented, disappointing, and buggy 
(the one bug I found concerns an object found in the final section).

Although old Pirate Adventure avoids a lot of puzzle cliches.  Several objects 
in the game have multiple uses; some change state and are used in different 
states. One of the NPCs both provides clues and is used directly to solve a 
later puzzle.  One NPC is an obstacle early on in the game, but needs to be 
exploited to overcome a puzzle later in the game.  Although some cliches are 
avoided lots are included: instant death; no UNDO; some puzzles require, for no 
obvious reason, repeating certain actions.  Some of puzzles seem pretty 
reasonable, others seem a bit arbitrary and you can easily unwittingly enter 
unwinnable states.  Fortunately the game isn't very large so restarting isn't 
very unpleasant and often leads to discovering something new.  There is an 
inventory limit (it never forms the crux of a puzzle, it just means more toing 
and froing) and a torch that can be exhausted.

Pirate Adventure packs quite a lot of puzzles into its small space; the sketch 
of the puzzle-dependency diagram (DM4's "lattice diagram") that I started making 
reveals a surprisingly complex and interesting structure.  The effect is one 
that I find all too rare in lots of games: there are always several avenues to 
explore, always a few objects whose purpose you haven't fathomed, and a few 
strategies that remain to be tried.  There are quite a few pleasing moment when 
you realise that certain objects have multiple uses.  On the other hand I know 
of no puzzle in Pirate Adventure that has an alternate solution (apart from a 
trivial rephrasing); it's a notable lack in Pirate Adventure.

The setting of the game, a tropical island (well, the game doesn't say it's 
tropical but let's assume it is), is both a strength and a weakness.  The text 
in the game is extremely minimal, yet the setting manages to be quite vivid.  
Adams achieves this primarily by placing the game in a setting that is familiar 
to most players: the classic desert island of adventure stories like Treasure 
Island and Robinson Crusoe.  Such stories were probably read by (or read to) the 
player as a child; the island takes on nostalgic and perhaps slightly magical 
qualities in the player's mind as a result.  It takes very few words for the 
player to be transported to a fantasy island with golden beaches, inviting 
lagoons, huts made from palm leaves, and a cave system in cliffs of soft rock.  
Those parts of the game are fine.  It's the additions that break the spell.  The 
cave system has a toolshed inside it apparently equipped with about half the 
necessary materials to build a boat, but the only access to the shed is either 
via a small crack or past a crocodile infested pit.  How did the equipment get 
in the shed?  How does the crocodiles' pit fill with water?  Why are the keys to 
a pirate's chest in [LOCATION WITHHELD]?  Historically this was totally 
acceptable, expected even, but these days many players would find it 
distasteful.

Designers would do well to briefly dip into Pirate Adventure to observe how it 
manages to create a solid and evocative setting with so few words, and how the 
puzzles and objects are interlinked with such economy.  But that is all.  Pirate 
Adventure has little to commend itself to the modern player, though it was great 
in its day.

VERSION: IF Comp release

This anime-inspired game takes a story-driven IF and mixes in a dating
sim and whole mess of world interactivity. The amount of depth here is
impressive; there's something like half a dozen girls you can woo, a
bunch of nonessential locations that evolve as the game goes by, and a
truly amazing number of objects you can find and play with.

The central plot is nothing to write home about -- cute girls with
psychic powers stalked by a mysterious conspiracy -- and dating sims in
general strike me as somewhere between creepy and pathetic, but where PK
Girl really shines is in the incredible amount of stuff you can do. I
wound up picking up an ice-cube tray early in the game; later on, I
managed to fill it with water, stick it in a freezer, pop out the
finished cubes, and started to make a frozen dessert with it. There was
no obvious puzzle associated with it, although I'm sure there was a use
for it, perhaps in currying favor with one of the girls. That level of
interactivity is present throughout the game; you can help a character
cook dinner, for example, or help comb another's hair. The sheer wealth
of different objects to play and experiment with, some useful to the
plot, some not, really makes the game feel more interactive and engaging
than much story-driven IF, to say nothing of the average dating sim,
which typically relies on simplistic multiple-choice gameplay.

I'm not a particular fan of this genre, which hurt its appeal a bit, but
for a player with different sensibilities, PK Girl could well be the
most enjoyable game in the comp, with enough replayability and depth to
have a long lifetime beyond the judging deadline.

 EMAIL: ???                                      ATMOSPHERE: Very Good

 CHARACTERS: Rather Shallow                      DIFFICULTY: Hard

Let me start by saying this: Plague Planet is a BIG game.  Lots of locations,
hundreds of puzzles, thousands of hours of fun for all the family, and at a
very reasonable price.  Which is rather useful, since you will have to employ
somebody to make your food, walk the dog, clean the house, etc., the moment
you buy it.  Why?  Because this game is so addictive you won't be able to
tear yourself away from it.

The plot is nothing if not unoriginal: you are a peaceful farmer on the
agrarian planet of Azura when a spaceship lands in your field.  And
that's pretty much all you know when you start the game.

Like many excellent games, however, you are left to discover the objective
for yourself.  In fact, you actually create the objective whilst you are
trying to do this.  I'm not spoiling the plot too much if I tell you: like
a prize idiot, you break into the spaceship, releasing the plague virus that
was contained within and condemning every man, woman and child (including
yourself) on the planet to death.

The puzzles in the game are, almost without exception, solvable with nothing
more than the objects to hand and a little logical thinking.  There are a
couple of mazes, but hints to the paths through them are lying around, and
there is no need to fall back on the old &quot;drop an object in every location&quot; 
routine.

Many puzzles are a joy to solve.  I particularly enjoyed learning to fly
the spaceship and satisfying the talking door unhappy with its position
in life.  And the sheer number of puzzles means that there is a tremendous
variety, ranging from variations on traditional ones (a key in a lock on the
opposite side of a locked door), to completely original conundrums.

There is only one &quot;what on earth is the author thinking of&quot; puzzle; the
meaning of the initials &quot;BMUS&quot;.  Just think of a certain American science
fiction serial...

As for the other characters in the game - well, there aren't all that
many.  A few robots, a few animals, a few religious maniacs who will kill
you on sight, and one miner with a severe flatulance problem.  They don't have
a wide variety of things to say, but there are various reasons why you can't
spend much time talking to them, anyway.

The atmosphere generated by this game is simply wonderful.  The descriptions
are verbose without being longwinded, and the problems fit into it all
perfectly - none are &quot;glued on&quot;.  You could almost believe you are there,
sneaking into a mine on the planet Zanthor, evading a Yillis Gorf on the
planet Aquaria, meeting an &quot;old friend&quot; on the planet Arboreta.

All in all, this game is simply marvellously addictive and amazingly
enjoyable.  If you can find a copy, snap it up at once...

These two games have a lot in common. First of all, both of them represent
first episodes of their respective series, implying there's going to be a
continuation, and thus stipulating their stories being incomplete. Then, both
works don't entrust the arduous task of frightening the player to
individualists, employing whole teams of eminently qualified specialists for
those purposes -- Plague benefits from the services of old trusty zombies,
while Space Horror resorts to the help of no less reliable murderous aliens.
Finally, both games represent carefully implemented, solid, and well- polished
efforts -- especially Space Horror, which only contained very slight glitches.
On the other hand, the author of Space Horror probably has had it somewhat
easier, since his work is a CYOA. At this point, it must be said I don' t share
the rather widespread in the IF-community bias against that kind of game.
Especially if it is done as careful as Space Horror -- with several fully
fleshed out plot lines, well-defined characters (although, of course, they 
aren't too interactive), and great illustrations. The author even managed to
squeeze in a couple of puzzles -- quite a feat, considering the game format.
The puzzles are logical enough, and fit well into the story. All in all, once
you let this game play on its home turf and don't cry for the moon, Mr. 
Cooney's work leaves nothing to be desired.

Plague isn't as strong at presentation and multimedia effects -- it's a text-
only adventure, but it possesses its own trump cards, which allow it to stay
abreast. The very first of them is the game name -- with all due respect to Mr.
Cooney, the title "Space Horror" is one of the leading contenders for the top
ten of the Most Generic Names Chart. Besides, Plague has a much more intense
beginning that sets the pace and atmosphere for the rest of the game. In fact,
the atmosphere and the setting make up about 80 percents of it. They're best
described with "bloody chaos". Of course, people could have different opinions
on it, depending on their personal preferences -- some players would find it
disgusting, others would dismiss it as rather hackneyed -- but as for me, I did
like it.

The characters... Now, Stacie, our main hero, was well defined from the
emotional point of view, so that I found it easy to identify with her. Although
the wondrous transformation of a rather inexperienced town girl into a rough
zombie slayer came kinda sudden and thus seemed somewhat unrealistic, I guess
it was part of the genre... or maybe I'm just underestimating inexperienced
town girls (typical case of male chauvinism;). Other characters only have been
good enough for a crowd scene -- maybe they'll hit the big time in the next
episode(s).

Plague is by no means a puzzle-oriented game; the puzzles present are kept
rather easy, and their main virtue is not hampering the story too much. They
cope with this task pretty well, except for one scavenger hunt requiring
careful examination of lots of scenery objects. Fortunately, the walkthrough
helped me to get over this unfavourable design choice without any losses.

The conclusions. It's true there's nothing groundbreaking about either of these
works -- they don't even try to expand the genre boundaries, and probably
reproduce every cliche existing within them. However, it's no less true both of
them represent solid, competently implemented efforts, and I don't regret any
minute spent playing them. I honestly hope the authors won't be put off by the
relatively low ranks they got in the Comp, and release the next episodes of
their respective works.

VERSION: 1

Er. Um. It's... odd, there's no denying that. It's generally
bug-and-typo free, but it's resoundingly... odd. It's what I'd imagine a
Rybread Celsius game to be like if it was done, well, right. Some great
puzzles, although there's rather a lot of guess-the-author's-mind - I
had to use hints several times - we're back to the oddness again;
indeed, parts of it kept reminding me of <a href = "n.html#nord">Nord and Bert</a>. Indeed, like
N&B, it's at times laugh-out-loud funny - the problems relating to the
end of the universe spring to mind.

Some puzzles, OTOH, are really ingenious, although they are, again,
sometimes let down by the guess-the-author's-thoughts aspects; I
particularly (gasp) *enjoyed the maze*; it was a different approach to
any I'd known, and worked well. Mind you, most people would argue that
it's not a maze :-).

There was one puzzle towards the end which was a little out-of-sorts,
though; and the author admits it in the walkthrough. All-in-all, I
didn't dock a point for it, since I enjoyed the rest of the game so
much; other people might be tempted to, and I'd understand it if they
did. In retrospect, looking at the walkthrough, it's at least nice that
they allowed a cleaner verb than the one I actually used, which probably
says more about my mind than that of the author :-)

It's a little too enthusiastic with 'last lousy points', but they do
seem at least vaguely logical; OTOH, the entire response to Xyzzy is a
whole new and intelligent approach that I've not encountered before. I
didn't enjoy the game from the challenge and puzzle aspect - but from
the entertainment aspect, I was enthralled.

*** Initial Thoughts 

I'm definitely not the only person who liked this game, but I may be the
only person who did not find the library puzzle baffling....

*** Writing (A)

The thing is, the writing was really funny.

It wasn't actually as perfectly technically executed as my letter grade
might imply; there were awkward turns of phrase here and there and the
occasional misuse of punctuation. But it was very, very funny.

One of my favorite bits (quite far into the game):

"All at once you enter the chimney with a sound that can only be
described as a Floop. All around is darkness. Then, with a
Binco-diddy-diddy you career downwards through metal ledges and wire
meshes. There is a resonating Ting as your body crashes against a curve
in the pipe. You slide downward at this angle towards light. The light
becomes brighter and brighter until it finally engulfs you, as you shoot
out of a large fireplace and into a tasteful room."

The subtitle of this game is "an interactive farce", and the author is
not kidding. It doesn't take itself seriously. It doesn't take you
seriously. It certainly doesn't take the protagonist or the NPCs
seriously. 

Funny.

*** Plot (B+)

It's surreal, but it's cohesive... and that's a neat trick.

Sort of a cross between 1950s sf, a physics major's worst nightmares
(I'm betting the author is or was a physics major), and a comedy (well,
it DID say 'farce'), the basic plot is... nearly incomprehensible, yet,
strangely appealing, much like the sideshow freaks at a circus. Watching
it unfold is somewhat akin to watching that guy in the sideshow who does
terrible things to his own body: you wince, but you watch anyhow because
it's fascinating, and you wonder how it's done.

Whether or not the ultimate conclusion makes any sense isn't the point.
The point is, it's fun to watch the progress.

*** Puzzles (B)

Some people found the puzzles baffling, inaccessible, incomprehensible
on several levels. I used the walkthrough a lot myself. But they do make
sense, and they contain an element of originality...

...and this game has, hands down, my favorite puzzle of the comp. It may
not actually have been terribly original, but I don't recall having seen
a puzzle quite like it before. Without giving away too much, there is a
point at which you have a certain set of objects, and you must
manipulate your environment such to match those objects. I found one of
the things necessary to do this nearly impossible to figure out, but the
rest was definitely a fun exercise.

There was a puzzle at the end I found mildly objectionable, but it was
obnoxious in a way some people might find funny. It involved a toilet.

*** NPCs (B)

You don't actually have a lot of control over your interaction with the
NPCs, but for some reason this did not bother me. I actually found the
characters (or, perhaps, caricatures) rather interesting, particularly
one repeating encounter... poor man. I think most important is that they
provided color that went well with the rest of the game.

*** Technical (B)

The aforementioned favorite puzzle, something I thought was a pretty
good coding trick, was worth an extra point or two in technical score. I
found no noticeable bugs.

*** Tilt (A-) and Final Thoughts

It's possible I enjoyed this game as much as I did because I used to
make a career out of baiting my physics-major ex-boyfriend. (I used to
tell him that physicists were just guessing anyhow, for instance.) Or
maybe it's just that I have a soft place in my heart for 1950s bad
science movies. But I think even without those biases, I would probably
have found the game very amusing. Given the existence of the walkthrough
for people stuck on the admittedly not always straightforward puzzles, I
think I would recommend this to nearly everyone with a sense of humor.

  NAME:  Planetfall                   GAMEPLAY:  Infocom Standard
  AUTHOR:  Steve Eric Meretzky        PLOT:  Excellent
  EMAIL:  ?                           ATMOSPHERE:  Excellent
  AVAILABILITY:  LTOI 1, Zork Anth.   WRITING:  Excellent
  PUZZLES: &lt;blank&gt;                    SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports
  CHARACTERS: Excellent               DIFFICULTY: &lt;blank&gt;

        In Planetfall, you start as a deck scrubber on a starship in the far
future.  When your ship is destroyed, your escape pod deposits you in a
deserted high-tech building complex on an alien world.  With the help of your
faithful robot companion B-19-7 (aka Floyd), you must discover what happened
to the people, and correct various problems before your time runs out.
        Planetfall was the first Infocom game I played, and still my
favourite.  Often billed as a science-fiction comedy, it really is not.
There are many amusing sidelights and funny responses from the author to your
failed actions, (one of my favourites is when you are looking at the planet's
computer datafiles, and come across an Infocom catalog.  When you read the
description for <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>, Floyd looking over your shoulder tells you that he
played that game and solved all the puzzles...except for how to get into that
little white house) but it is not at all a straight comedy in the same sense
that <A HREF="l.html#leather">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</A>, or <A HREF="h.html#hitch">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</A>
would be.  It merely feels like one because the game is constantly charming
you in one way or another.  Floyd, generally remembered as Infocom's best NPC
is useful for only three things in the game, but provides you with a constant
stream of amusing banter, from relating tales of the time he helped someone
find a lost paper clip, to passing along the latest hot gossip about Dr.
Fizpick.
        Oftentimes text games fall into the syndrome of providing one and
only one use for each item in the game, so that if you have found a use for
an item you can throw it away, confident that it will not be called for
again.  Not so in Planetfall (and Meretzky games in general).  Several items
have more than one use, while others have no use at all.
        Planetfall's original edition contained Infocom's usual batch of
interesting freebies (I still keep the Stellar Patrol ID card in my wallet
mixed in with the credit cards).  However, it was also one of the games
selected to be redone as a Solid Gold edition with onscreen hints.  Get both
editions if possible.
        The IBM version of Lost Treasures of Infocom 1 contained an original
version of the program.  The Macintosh version of LTOI 1 contains the Solid
Gold Edition.  PC users who have Macintosh-using friends can of course try to
get a copy of the datafile from the LTOI1-Mac version, and run it off an IBM
interpreter.
        Planetfall was one of the games selected for novelization when Avon
Books put out a series of Infocom Books several years ago.  The novel version
of Planetfall is really a sequel to Planetfall (and Stationfall).  This book
(not written by Meretzky) was much closer to the Battletech universe than
Planetfall's, and was loaded with tiresome, sophomoric, un-clever humour.  I
read most of the other Avon Infocom books in a day or so each, but Planetfall
took almost a month to force myself through.
        On the brighter side though, another Planetfall sequel is the next
game that Activision plans to release under the Infocom label.  The game, to
be called &quot;Planetfall 2: The Search for Floyd&quot;, is scheduled for release
late in 1995.  As a prelude to this, they included the original (non-Solid
Gold) Planetfall game in their recently released Zork Anthology.
        Still, Planetfall remains not only my favourite text game, but my
favourite adventure game.

        [Well, we've all got our fingers crossed hoping that Activision
doesn't fumble this game as badly as they did Return to Zork.  But I'm giving
public notice, if Floyd looks like either R2D2 or a garbage can, the fur will
fly. --GKW]

Planetfall is one of the greatest adventure games I have ever played!
All the puzzles are logical and have, more or less, the correct balance
of difficulty. It's amazing how the puzzles can be solved once you just
step back and think about them a bit. However, I think a little
background is in order before I move on.

You start off as an Ensign Seventh Class, and the scourge of your
existence is Ensign First Class Blather, who acts like a drill sergeant.
However, as fate would have it, some terrible disaster happens to the
station whose floor you are being made to scrub, and you (should) take
advantage of this opportunity by going into an escape pod. It takes you
to a deserted planet, and you have to figure just what the heck you're
supposed to do there. Along the way, you end up meeting the robot Floyd,
whom every Planetfall player seems to like.

This brings me to the characters. For interactive fiction, the
characters are very well developed, since IF NPCs have the tendency to
have little or no personality at all. Because of this, I feel that
Planetfall's NPCs are big achievements, even though they wouldn't be
considered well developed characters for non-interactive fiction since
they are basically flat stereotypes. Floyd is basically like a cheery
little child whom every player seems to find charming. I have to love it
when he says how he was able to solve all the puzzles in Zork except how
to get into the white house. Blather acts like a stereotypical drill
sergeant, and most of his personality is revealed through your dreams
since you must sleep during the game. I have to love that one dream
sequence in which you refuse to scrub the scenery and throw your brush
at him, only to have him go after "the valuable company property". ^_^

Also, the atmosphere is pretty good. It has humorous touches amongst an
interesting planet. It has a machine shop, some offices, some mess
halls, and also a library. The writing is pretty good too. It gives fine
descriptions of the rooms and is some of the funniest writing I've seen
this side of the Space Quest series (which is remarkably similar in many
ways). As for the parser, it's a typical Infocom parser, so it's quite
good.

Overall, Planetfall is easily one of the best adventure games I've ever
played because of the balanced and logical puzzles throughout the game,
the humorous writing, and the amusing characters. My only complaint
about the game is that the laser wasn't described well enough, making
two puzzles difficult. I thought that the laser was supposed to be like
one of those laser pointers, but it's actually more like a laser gun.
However, Planetfall is definitely one game you should check out!

VERSION: Competition Edition

You're a witness to a hijacking. You're seeking a McGuffin in the form
of a strange silver crate. You're investigating cover-ups in your
company.  You're breaking into a strange plant. You're just generally
trying to create mayhem. You're unveiling a government cover-up. All
these things go on in Mike Roberts's The Plant, an entertaining caper
better enjoyed for its sheer daffiness than as a coherent story.

The initial premise is that your boss's car breaks down and you want
to get help, but it's a thin veil, since you promptly witness soldiers
hijacking a convoy of trucks and evidently forget all about trying to
get your car started again, since you decide you want a piece of
whatever action the soldiers are after. Weird coincidences drive much
of the plot from there on: you defeat a security device to get into
this supposedly ultra-secret plant by using stuff lying around, which
seemed a tad absurd.  The puzzle you solve to get into the underground
laboratory area is clever but relies on everyone in the complex being
either blind or thoroughly stupid; other puzzles function on similar
assumptions. As such, the tone varies somewhat; what might have been a
sinister feel, created by the opening section, is subverted by the
story's failure to develop any real sense of menace. The Plant works
better viewed as a series of obstacles to overcome than as a real
story, since the story is not always engaging.  The author consciously
decided to make it impossible to lose or otherwise make the game
unwinnable, a design choice that works well in some contexts but not
in this one. The story, after all, to the extent I could make sense of
it, involves some danger; breaking into heavily guarded top-secret
complexes usually entails negative consequences if caught. But there
are several points where harm should be imminent, logically, and
knowing that the danger will just keep getting closer but never
arrive, Zeno's-paradox style, destroys the illusion of the story and
takes away the tension. This is particularly true at one point late in
the game, when guards see you through a window, carrying out nefarious
acts, and pound on the window. There is, of course, a door right next
to the window, but you can examine everything in the room, take a nap,
make faces at the guards, etc., and they will never, as far as I know,
walk through the door. What might be an exciting moment is fairly
ho-hum. Now, admittedly, with an IF engine that supports UNDO as well
as SAVE/RESTORE, any &quot;death&quot; is but a passing setback--but avoiding
death does affect a player's emotional experience, and knowing that
there was no death to avoid reduces whatever emotional effect there
is. What might be a good choice in another sort of game does not, in
short, serve this one well.

Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy here. The puzzles rival those of
<a href = "e.html#enlight">Enlightenment</a> as the best in this year's competition: they are
challenging but fair, with the exception of the one where an object is
discoverable only with the command READ AUTHOR'S MIND. There are also
enough of them for the player to feel like he or she has accomplished
something, but few enough that the game is finishable within two
hours. Several of them involve more than one object, or require
manipulating the environment in creative ways, though a few rely on a
few rely on random scenery-searching. The ones that involve opening
passages or passing obstacles provide short cuts once the initial
puzzle is solved, a great time-saver. The author also fairly
consistently rewards the player for solving a puzzle by supplying more
story, usually via cut-scenes of sorts--the player witnesses something
going on. Some of the cut-scenes actually are cut-scenes--the text all
goes by at once--and some aren't, and the logic of the distinction was
not obvious to me. (The ones that force the player to keep typing Z
don't actually give any potential for difference in how the player
experiences the scene--at least, not obviously so.) The nature of the
puzzles solved does make the player feel like he or she is coming
closer to the goal, and getting glimpses of the McGuffin when
obstacles are cleared reinforces that feeling to great effect. Your
boss, along for the ride, is directly relevant only occasionally,
though it seems like he might provide information about a few things
if asked; still, he's a vaguely comic figure that helps lighten the
feel of the story (another reason why the tone is a bit inconsistent).

The Plant feels well-crafted as a whole; bugs are few, the writing is
outstanding, and objects, even complex ones, largely do what they're
supposed to do. That feeling of polish helps overcome the flaws in the
story--or, more accurately, the flaws in the story don't detract much
from its enjoyment because the game is so playable as a whole. The
best puzzle in the game leads directly to its most ridiculous moment,
but as long as the player can suspend disbelief, it doesn't really
matter--because there's no question whether the moment works as the
author intends it to.  The Plant illustrates how a skillful IF author
can spin an entertaining yarn even with a contrived or silly plot, as
long as he or she attends to the details that matter to the player;
this one works well enough that I gave it an 8.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag17.html">SPAG #17</a> -- May 10, 1999

You know, by the time I get finished writing these reviews, I'm pretty
tired. It takes a lot of energy to put out twenty or thirty thousand
words about competition entries, and even though my reviews are
shorter than last year's, and there are fewer games involved, they
were also written in a much more compressed judging period, so my
exhaustion level is about the same. However, every year I've been
reviewing the competition games I've gotten a little reward in the
final game of the batch. In 1996, I was playing the games in order of
filename, so the last game I played was <a href = "t.html#tapestry">Tapestry</a>, an excellent piece
of work by Dan Ravipinto which ended up taking second in the
competition as a whole. Last year I let Lucian Smith's Comp97 order my
choices randomly, and ironically the last game on the list ended up
being Smith's own <a href = "e.html#edifice">The Edifice</a>. And true to form, that was another
excellent game to finish on, and it ended up winning all the marbles
in the 1997 comp. So it was with both trepidation and eagerness that I
broached the final game of this year's batch, The Plant. When I saw it
was by Michael J. Roberts, the legendary implementor of both TADS and
HTML-TADS, my anticipation was increased even further. I've never
played one of Roberts' games, having been an Inform initiate when I
started programming, and having entered the IF scene just shortly
before Roberts' departure. And after this buildup, I'm pleased to say
that the Plant completely lives up to my mini-tradition of grand
finales. It was a great game to end the competition with -- the reward
I was hoping for, so that this review wouldn't be too hard to write.

Probably the thing I liked the most about The Plant was its puzzles. I
know there were several other games this year that were focused on
puzzles, and some of the puzzles in those games were
excellent. However, I liked The Plant's puzzles better precisely
*because* the game wasn't focused on puzzles. Instead, its puzzles
were very well integrated into its story, so solving the puzzles
really propelled the narrative. It's much more interesting to solve a
puzzle when it opens the door to the next piece of the story, rather
than being just one of a roomful of puzzles that you have to solve to
escape that room. The Plant was probably the only game in this year's
competition to give me a feeling similar to what I have when I play
Infocom games. I love that feeling of uncovering an exciting story by
cleverly putting pieces together, using items in unexpected ways, or
doing the right thing at just the right time. And the game's story is
definitely an exciting one. It begins as you are stranded on an
abandoned side-road with your boss, marooned by his unreliable
car. It's up to you to find a phone or a service station and get
moving again, but when you go looking you may find more than you
bargained for. I won't give too much away about the secrets that are
eventually revealed, but the game definitely packs plenty of
surprises. The pacing is excellent -- I only felt completely stuck
once. I turned to the walkthrough to solve the problem, just because I
wanted to finish as much of the game as I could in the two-hour time
limit, but if you're playing The Plant for the first time, let me urge
you *not* to check the walkthrough unless you're completely stuck. All
the puzzles are completely logical, none of them require reading the
designer's mind, and many of them are quite satisfying to solve,
requiring several steps or clever combinations of objects, or both.

Now, the story itself does have some flaws. There are some parts that
felt quite implausible to me, and from time to time the fact that your
boss follows you around in your travels doing the same two or three
things all the time starts to feel a little artificial. In addition,
there are one or two minor spelling errors in the game. Outside of
this, the plotting and writing are quite good. The Plant's prose often
conveyed a very vivid sense of the visual. I drive by a plant like
this about twice a month, and the game's descriptions of it, how its
completely industrial and utilitarian networks of pipes and lights can
seem almost like an abstract fairyland when glimpsed from afar, are
right on the mark. I could really visualize most of the places in the
game, and the mental pictures the game's text creates are quite
dramatic and compelling. In addition, the game uses a few small
touches here and there which utilize the power of HTML TADS. No
pictures or sound, but a few well-placed hyperlinks in the help text
and one or two spots with specially formatted text really make the
game look sharp, and add to the very visual quality of the prose. If
you sometimes start to feel a little impatient with all the growing
that the medium of interactive fiction is doing, and long for a good
old-fashioned Infocom-style thrill ride, check out The Plant. I think
it may be just what you're looking for.

Rating: 9.0

  AUTHOR:  Amy Briggs                    PLOT:  Good

  CHARACTERS:  Not bad                   DIFFICULTY:  On the Easy Side

        Plundered Hearts is a romance novel set in the 1600's.  You must
rescue your father from the clutches of an evil island governor with the aid
of a pirate captain who lights your fire.  
        Plundered Hearts takes a rather standard plotline and uses it to
very good effect.  The writing feels very much like a Harlequin novel, with
enough amusing puzzles and clever responses to keep me, a
non-romance-novel-reader interested to the end.  
        The puzzles are a little easier than the standard Infocom fare, but
generally interesting ones that can be reasoned or inferred.  There are few
&quot;guess what the author is thinking puzzles&quot;.  
        The game's strongest point though is in its characterization.  Not
in the other characters; Crulley, Jamison, Lafonde and the others are rather
standard, thus my character rating of 1.2.  Rather, this game characterizes
you, the player, more than any other of Infocom's offerings.
        In most Infocom games, who YOU are is either unimportant or doesn't
affect the plot much.  In <A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork</A>, you're just some anonymous guy who was
walking by the white house.  You have no particular personality, or history
before this point.  <A HREF="#planet">Planetfall</A> makes an effort to paint your character with
the enclosed diary, but it is all chrome.  None of it really affects the
story once you're in it.  As a result, I always sort of imagined myself as
the main character.  To some extent this was Infocom's intention; much of
their early advertising talked about imagining yourself waking up inside a
story.
        Plundered Hearts, more than any other game gave me the feeling of
really being inside someone ELSE'S head.  Throughout the game, who you are
plays an important part.  Disguising your identity and altering your
appearance is important in several places to elicit a desired reaction from
other characters (not to mention avoiding some undesired reactions).  As a
result, the game scores very well in &quot;intangibles&quot;, thus my high Wildcard
rating.
     Plundered Hearts is one of Infocom's more underrated games.  A very good
blend of puzzle solving and story.

VERSION: Version 1.0 (1997 competition release)

Right about the time that Poor Zefron's Almanac (hereafter called PZA)
starts feeling like another humdrum sword-and-sorcery game, it
executes a nice surprising twist. To say too much more would be to
give the game away, but the fact that the author bills PZA as &quot;an
interactive cross-genre romp&quot; is a clue toward its direction. This
twist made the game refreshing and fun again, especially after the
frustration it caused me when I began playing it. More on that
later. PZA does several things very well, one of which is its
eponymous book, a tome owned by your wizardly master Zefron and left
behind after his mysterious disappearance. This almanac contains a
feature unique to all the CONSULTable items in IFdom (as far as I
know): it can be BROWSEd. Browsing the almanac brings forth a random
entry from within its pages; not only is it great fun to read these
random entries, it also gives a sense of how thoroughly the almanac
has been implemented. This device would be most welcome in other
IF... how I'd love to browse the Encyclopedia Frobozzica or the
<a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>! Just having the book at hand lent a
sense of scope and excitement to PZA.

Unfortunately, my first 45 minutes or so of playing this game were
extremely frustrating. PZA suffers from a couple of serious design
flaws, the gravest of which is its repeated violation of the Fifth
Right (from Graham Nelson's &quot;Player's Bill of Rights&quot;): not to have
the game closed off without warning. Because of a fairly flexible (but
extremely temporary) magic spell that becomes available at the very
beginning of the game, I found myself repeatedly stranded, unable to
proceed and forced to RESTART. This happened again later on in the
game -- I committed a perfectly logical action and found out hundreds
of turns later that this action had closed off the endgame. This is a
frustrating experience, and one that could easily have been avoided
with a few minor changes to the game's structure, changes which would
not have had any discernible effect on puzzles or plot. In addition,
there are a few areas in which the player character can be killed
without warning, always an unwelcome design choice. PZA is (as far as
I know) Carl Klutzke's first game, so chalk these flaws up to
education. I look forward to playing another Klutzke game as
well-implemented as PZA, but designed more thoughtfully.

One nice element of PZA was its facility with IF homage. The game's
&quot;cluple&quot; spell not only had a name that sounded straight out of
<a href = "e.html#enchant">Enchanter</a>, it was virtually identical to that series' &quot;snavig&quot;
spell. The almanac itself (as well as a number of other features) was
a skillful allusion to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Finally,
the XYZZY command response is one of the more clever I've seen in a
while. Clearly PZA's author is a devotee of the old games, and his
devotion shows in his work. I am hopeful that his next piece of IF
will live up to his worthy aspirations.

Prose: The prose in PZA is generally very good. Rooms, objects, and
random events are described concisely but with attention to
detail. Some of the locations are rather sparsely treated (for
example, the town consists of one location), but such skimping is
always done in service of the plot, and more detail would serve to
distract rather than to enrich.

Plot: This is definitely the strongest point of PZA. The game starts
out with an engaging hook, and after the twist I was definitely
enjoying the direction of the story quite a bit. In addition, the
author has manipulated the scoring system in such a way as to give the
feeling of multiple endings. Granted, many of those endings amount to
one version or another of &quot;*** You have died ***&quot;, but not all of
them. There are more and less successful solutions to the story, and
they are integrated so naturally into the endgame text that they
almost escape notice. One of the nicest implementations of multiple
endings in the competition.

Puzzles: Here there were problems. What happens to PZA is that its
individual problems are well-considered, and their solutions are
perfectly logical. However, when the actions that comprise those
solutions are attempted in other areas of the game, they all too often
drive the narrative into a blind alley from which there is no
escape. It's one of the hardest balancing acts in interactive fiction:
how to have sensible puzzles logically integrated into the game,
without making the narrative too linear, which in their elements
create no dead ends for the player.  PZA doesn't pull it off.

Technical:
writing -- I found no technical errors in the writing.

coding -- Once I played PZA on WinTADS, I had no problems with it.  I
started out trying to use it on my old DOS version of TR, and before I
could even get one command out it was giving me TADS &quot;Out of Memory&quot;
errors. Whether this is a bug in the program of the interpreter, I
don't know enough about TADS to say.

VERSION: Release 1

The superhero genre isn't my favorite. I've never been a big fan of larger-
than-life, hard-to-believe super powers. Sure, I enjoy the comic-based movie 
from time to time - Superman with his flying, strength, and x-ray vision; 
Spiderman with his spider-sense and web-slinging; Batman with his. super wealth; 
X-Men, of course. I've been known to read a superhero comic, although not 
recently. I've played superhero IF once or twice. 

In essence, I'm not the ideal fan for The Potter and the Mould. This is a story 
for superhero fans, and it comes complete with all the trappings. Origin story? 
Check. Mutant-like powers? Definitely. An imperfect, self-doubting protagonist? 
Uh huh. The mentor/student relationship? You bet. An evil but misunderstood 
villain? Sure. Motivation by revenge? Of course. It's everything you'd expect 
from a superhero story.

What I like best about The Potter and the Mould is that it keeps moving. It will 
appeal most to superhero fans, but it's a frenetic and fast-paced adventure that 
kept me enthralled for the four hours it took to complete. It *feels* more 
difficult than it really is, which is a credit to the author's talent. The 
puzzles aren't hard enough to impede the action, yet they leave a sense of 
accomplishment in their wake. My longest sticking point involved a machine-room 
and a clay dog. After solving it - which was easier than I tried to make it - I 
realized that the puzzles were simple and understated. They work to keep the 
story moving, not to work against it, and that's probably the best kind.

In most cases, Robert avoids text-dumps by way of action prompting. This 
typically comes as a nudge from an NPC, beginning with the rescue scene at the 
beginning, through Waterfall's revelations in the mall, to the hurried trip to 
the Potter's inner sanctuary. It works very well, and keeps things interactive.

The story has some surprises and twists. It strays from the predictable formula 
particularly near the end. Even though I appreciate the change-up, the victory 
felt less than satisfying. It was like facing down Dr. Evil, and getting a back
-stabbing Mini-Me instead. What follows is an exciting bit, but not what I 
expected.

The writing in this, Robert Street's latest game, left me puzzled. Even though 
I've commented about this in prior reviews, it seemed more noticeable here; 
equally hard to pin down, but more prevalent. It could just be his style, but 
I'm not convinced that's it. Too many sentences (even some in close proximity) 
ended awkwardly with the word "though". There was a glaring lack of contractions 
throughout the text - not always, but in certain passages - making it more 
awkward. This alone isn't a sticking point, but coupled with some awkward 
phrasings in general, it just didn't always read *right*.

Take the following - just one random example from hundreds of lines of text:

"The shops in this corner seem to be trying to outdo each other with silly 
displays."

The words "seem to be trying to" are the awkward bit. I might write this as:

"The shops in this corner strive to outdo each other with silly displays."

These kinds of things weave themselves throughout the text. The removed bit was 
clunky and passive. The replacement flows better, and it's more active. I 
usually qualify these kinds of comments with a reminder that I'm no expert. I 
have to look two or three times to figure out just what it is about a sentence 
that bothers me. Even in the example above, I might change "each other" to "one 
another". At times, the text in The Potter and the Mould felt like a first 
draft, as though it had been written once and then left alone. At other times, 
the text felt too heavily edited, as if the smooth flow and original expression 
had been lost under the weight of so much revision. Which the case may be, I 
don't know. Like I said, it might just be the author's unique style.

Robert didn't skimp on details. Even though this is an ever-moving game, the 
extra effort shows in the responses, from looking around to trying various other 
actions. This isn't always the case in story-heavy works, where the only 
important thing is doing exactly what advances the plot. I liked that The Potter 
and the Mould stood up to some prodding.

The hero's premise, now that I've come to it, is that he can "mould" his shape 
into various things. Robert implemented this in a logical, user-friendly way. 
Mould options are task-specific and presented in a list. This maintains the 
illusion that you're really able to morph into anything, where free-form input 
(John Evans's games come to mind) makes this very difficult. It also gives the 
PC some say-so as to how the player proceeds. In other words, the PC dreams up 
these forms so the player doesn't have to. More than that, it eliminates the "I 
tried to become a diamond-tipped drill, but it didn't work" complaints, at the 
expense of limiting the player's options. Occasionally, this let me figure out a 
puzzle where I wouldn't otherwise have had all the facts, but all in all, it was 
a good design.

Next comes the obligatory Adrift discussion - but I'll keep it short. I'm a fan 
of Adrift's auto-mapping, even if I found some necessary exits unmarked on it. 
It can be a crutch sometimes, and I probably shouldn't have tried to rely on the 
map as much. I'm not a fan, however, of Adrift's pick-apart parsing. I call it 
that, because I don't know if it has a real name. This is most problematic when 
commenting a transcript. If you type something that has the word "undo" anywhere 
in it, Adrift believes you intend to undo your last move. If you comment about 
"he" or "she", Adrift starts matching pronouns, leading to some interesting 
responses. Knowing nothing about its inner workings, I still get the impression 
that grammar isn't built the way it is in Hugo and other IF languages. Adrift 
makes plenty of assumptions, and it doesn't conform to any grammar rules. If it 
finds what appears to be a verb, and what appears to be a noun referencing a 
known object, it reacts. At times, such as when it reacts on an NPC you haven't 
encountered yet, it can even be a little spoilery.

Even though I'm not a superhero fan, I enjoyed The Potter and the Mould. It was 
trippy, but it was fun. It's a solid game, and a credit to the author's 
experience.

My Spring Thing score: "8"

VERSION: Release 1

Given that I've liked Kathleen's other two major releases, I looked
forward to this one with some eagerness, expecting another lighthearted
and proficient period romance.

Well, this could be considered a period romance, set as it is around a
medieval woman faced with danger, death, disinheritance -- and the
possibility of marriage.

Lighthearted -- no. I found it fairly gloomy, actually. Which would not
in itself be enough to doom the game, but it did drain some of the
entertainment value out of the romance, which was rather vaguely
sketched.

Kathleen has since said that she did not intend Prized Possession to be
a romance per se at all; so I am left to wonder why I considered it a
failed one, rather than a successful something-else. Perhaps it's
audience expectation, but I'd like to hope that I'm clever enough not to
have put Kathleen into a specific niche on the basis of two games. I
think the answer is that I found the primary NPC to be one of the
driving influences of the plot; that most of the other characters were
around for so little time that it was difficult to formulate a sense of
my relationship to them. Where I did formulate such a sense, it was a
sense that conformed to the stereotypical characterizations of the
romance genre: there is, for instance, a character who fits the type of
the Sinister and Ill-Meaning Guardian. All the game's clues seemed to
push me towards the conclusion that that's what he was; I simply
accepted that and went on.

The other problem, from my point of view, is that it's possible to die
or get a very unhappy ending in this game, not once, but over and over,
on almost every turn, by picking the wrong one of two apparently
equivalent options or by failing to do something nonobvious in the nick
of time. I made a valiant effort, but went to the walkthrough and stayed
there after the second scene or so. I never did feel as though I had a
clear handle on what was going on, exactly: who everyone was, what they
intended towards me, what I was trying to accomplish, or even exactly
where I was. The height of my confusion came when I read some line about
the curve of the heroine's belly, and presumed, from this clue, that she
was in fact already pregnant, through some mischance, and that this was
the reason for her apparent disgrace and travails on the road. I
eventually decided that I'd misread or misinterpreted that, but it is
evidence, I think, of how little the game gives the player to work with.
The only aspect of the plot that I felt I really understood was the
shadowy, vague beginnings of a romance with the main NPC. Doubtless this
also affected my idea of what sort of game it was.

Leaving aside all of those considerations, I think the game's choppiness
tells against it in another way. I felt that I had no luxury to explore,
to enjoy the things that one enjoys in IF. I agree that it would've been
a dead bore to experience in full however many days we were on the road,
or whatever, but possibly some happier medium could have been found than
the rapid chapter jumps, which in places occur every couple of moves. It
would be wrong to say that this game was not interactive enough:
compared to something like <a href = "r.html#rameses">Rameses</a>, it's full of choices. The only
problem is that most of those choices lead to disaster. I felt impelled
to keep going, because I knew that my PC was in dreadful peril; there
was no time to waste, not even on reading the game text more carefully.
And then came panic and then disaster, or at least a long lifetime in
the local nunnery.

Summary: Railroady is not quite the word I want; the experience was more
reminiscent of a rickety rollercoaster that started and slowed again
unpredictably, and sometimes flung me out of the car entirely.
(Litigation ensues.) Nonetheless, it still has the technical cohesion
and decent writing one expects from a proven author, and if I was
disappointed, it was relative to some high expectations.

VERSION: Version 1.0

The biggest drawback to this entry is its interpreter, which runs only
under OS/2.  I sincerely hope that this isn't detrimental to its vote
count, because it's a lot of fun, and deserves more attention than the
(relatively) small OS/2 crowd can give it.

Essentially, &quot;Promoted!&quot; is a zany satire of life in the corporate
world, with a well-established mythos and lots of in-jokes that non-
office players probably won't get much out of.  The biggest plus is
that the setting is not just a bunch of inside jokes based solely on
DeSanto's place of employment.  Anyone who's worked in a maze of
twisty little cubicles (all alike) will be able to relate to the
situations presented here.  DeSanto's take on corporate culture is
amusing and well thought out, and he has a good grasp of what REALLY
goes on in an office, though it's not quite up to the level of Scott
Adams (and when I say Scott Adams here, I am of course referring to
the &quot;Dilbert&quot; Scott Adams, not the SCOTT ADAMS Scott Adams).

On the other hand, some of the puzzles could be improved.  There's
lots of death without warning, a bit too much in a game without
&quot;UNDO,&quot; and some very text-adventurish situations.  The colored tape
puzzle, for example, felt exactly like something that didn't quite
make it into a &quot;<A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork</A>&quot; game.  The disguise puzzles, on the other hand,
are neat, and quiz the player on the details of the world DeSanto has
built.

I also encountered some difficulty with Rexx-Adventure itself.  It's a
neat engine, a snap to grasp, but a bit buggy.  Before I'd finished
&quot;Promoted!&quot;, I'd crashed the engine multiple times, receiving VX-REXX
errors when I clicked among the lists a bit too fast, or when I tried
to exceed my inventory's capacity.  Future bug fixes should eliminate
this.  One advantage to the interface is the fact that its obviation
of guess-the-verb paves the way for some obscure puzzles that wouldn't
be acceptable with typed commands (i.e. &quot;STRIP WIRES&quot;).  Here's hoping
Rexx-Adventure sees ports to more systems.

VERSION: 1.12.16 (10 Feb. 2006)

I take it as axiomatic that interactive fiction is an entirely new art form.
It bears, perhaps, the same relation to conventional fiction that film bears
to theatre. Or possibly that's too grandiose a comparison.

One difficulty we face in nurturing this new medium is that, because the
community of enthusiasts is tiny and the forums through which new works can
be discussed are few and unknown to the public at large, every new work
that's released gets tossed into the common pool with all of the existing
works, to sink or swim as best it can.

The lack of stratification or hierarchy in the marketplace (using the term
in a broad sense) puts a burden on novice authors. Where is the interested
novice to get feedback and tutelage from more experienced authors, without
being discouraged by scathing criticism? How are we to be fair and helpful
when discussing the weaknesses of what can only be called student works?

I started thinking about this after I spent a couple of hours wandering
around in Provenance. Cory Arnett's first game is precisely a student work.
The author shows promise, and I hope he'll work hard to hone his skills and
release a more polished, thoughtful game, or several of them. Provenance
itself, however, is unlikely to attract many players, or hold their
attention for very long.

The strength of the game lies in the touches of creepy, ominous atmosphere
and in the grandeur of the scenery at certain locations. Its shortcomings
are just as easily listed: The model world is thin, the story is incoherent,
and the code is buggy.

As the story opens you're in your carriage, riding through a forest. Night
is falling and winter closing in. Shortly you reach a Victorian manor house,
and a sinister-looking trail of blood droplets on the front walk leads you
up to the door. As you explore the house and grounds, various momentary
incidents hint that All Is Not Well. In the end, sad to say, these glimpses
turn out to be a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

The effect of the brooding atmosphere is undercut by bits of florid
over-writing. Consider this, from the intro: "The sun has breached the
horizon and its fervent intensity warms the land.... Only the sound of your
horse's hooves break up the monotonous silence that permeates through the
solitude." Note the grammatical error: "sound" is singular, so the verb
should be "breaks up." Also, in this passage the sun is rising. A few
sentences later, it's setting.

The game fails to follow through consistently with the gloomy spell cast by
winter: When you enter the garden of the manor house, you'll find roses and
wisteria in bloom, as well as ripe tomatoes and strawberries. Curiously, you
can pick eight varieties of vegetable in the garden (counting strawberries
as a vegetable), but they have nothing to do with solving the game.

The player character's goal is not initially clear, but the game turns out
to be a treasure hunt. Most players will probably find, before long, a handy
list of the things we're supposed to collect. Finding the key that will get
you into the house is more challenging, however. I feel this puzzle is
borderline unfair, because it requires that you examine scenery objects
three deep. Without giving spoilers, you have to 'x abc', then when you
notice a mention of def in the description of abc, 'x def', and finally 'x
ghi' based on an object mentioned in the description of def. This is
borderline unfair because many of the scenery objects mentioned in the room
descriptions can't be examined at all. By the time the location of the key
is reached, the average player may have wearied of examining things and
gotten lazy.

But if you're not lazy -- if you meticulously examine everything in sight,
as you need to in order to get on -- you'll most likely get annoyed by how
thin the model world is. I certainly did.

Once you're inside the house, the scenery is a bit more varied. I found one
way to get killed (without notice), and there's one extremely boring
character I could attempt to talk to. This character wanders from room to
room under the control of a random number generator, but does not respond in
any way when you ask him questions to which he might be supposed to know the
answers. I did find two topics he'd give brief, uninformative replies to.

The author's enthusiasm for Victorian furniture quickly begins to seem
obsessive. Various pieces are described in ways that include their precise
measurements and the methods used to produce those beautiful wood finishes.
Consider, for example, this description of the bathtub: "An amazing display
of Victorian decorating taken to the ultimate limit, the cast iron bath tub
has been painted a sea foam green on the outside with a scene of four sea
fairies riding sailfish on large rolling waves. The inside of the tub has
been painted white. Four gold plated claw feet support the tub." You can't
sit in the tub, and you can't examine the sea fairies, the sailfish, or the
claw feet. Ah, well -- it's certainly pretty.

The writing of room descriptions appears to have been done at different
times, or at least with insufficient thought as to how various descriptions
relate to one another. In the upstairs hall we're told that the master
bedroom, to the south, "dominates most of the upstairs." But when we enter
the master bedroom we're told this: "Although called the master bedroom this
room is no larger than the other small bedrooms. It is cramped, yet cozy."
So much for dominating the upstairs. In a similar gaffe, a character (who
never appears onstage and has nothing to do with the process of winning the
game) is referred to in one document as Jacob, and in a different document
as Jonathan.

There are numerous minor bugs in the printouts. At one spot a sentence
breaks off in the middle. At another a room exit is not mentioned in the
"can't go" message, which usually lists all of the available exits. At a
third spot, the NPC (okay, he's the butler) entered and said something that
seemed urgent, but when I tried to ask him about it, the game reported, "The
butler is not here." Things that don't exist if you try to examine them can
occasionally be used, for example by putting other things inside them.

The most significant bugs seem to be caused by the author's assumption that
the player would perform certain actions in a given order. For instance,
there's a locked box, to which you'll sooner or later find the key, in a
certain location. When I unlocked it while going through the game on my own,
it was empty. Or at least, no contents appeared; the verb 'search' is not
implemented, so I couldn't search the box, only examine it. When I reached
the same box using the walkthrough, I had just performed an action that
caused a brief cut-scene -- and NOW the box had some objects in it.

Even the walkthrough is buggy. The first time a certain map is mentioned is
when you're told to drop it. Apparently the butler is supposed to give it to
you ... but there's a bug in the software that somehow prevented him from
doing so. And without the map, you can't win the game.

The dramatic setup for the treasure hunt is contained in a Last Will &
Testament, which you'll probably find before too long. This document
contradicts itself with respect to the structure of the family that lives
(or lived) in the house, and it contains, as far as I could see, no
information that you actually need in order to win the game, until you reach
the final codicil. All that legal boilerplate is numbingly irrelevant. Later
there's a long and fairly sensible description of alchemy -- but again, it
seems to be irrelevant to winning the game.

At a couple of spots, the author seems to have been unable to figure out how
to move the player back to the house from a remote location, so he simply
puts the player character to sleep and has him or her wake up again in the
master bedroom. No explanation of these transitions is ever offered.

The final phase of the game involves negotiating a very large maze.
Fortunately, the automatic map generator in Adrift makes short work of what
would otherwise be an extremely tedious process. When you reach the center
of the maze and perform the actions you've been instructed (in a certain
document) to perform, the final result is simply, "You win!!!" That's it --
no marching band, no sun bursting through the clouds, no hearty
congratulatory handshake from the Vice President of Adventure Gaming
Virtuosity. It's a letdown, but rather in keeping with the game as a whole,
I'd have to say.

Arnett is capable of moments of startling vision, and he clearly wants to
engage readers by using evocative materials. (Those drops of blood are far
from the only glimpses of savagery in Provenance.) In his next game I hope
he'll trim the number of rooms in half, implement more verbs and scenery,
invent more puzzles that aren't simply keys and locked doors, integrate the
story elements a lot more firmly into the game scenario, give us a few NPCs
with meat on their bones, and arm-twist a few beta-testers to put the screws
to his code.

That's all it would take, really.

Well, this one's got it all...unfortunately.  Spelling and grammatical
errors in almost every sentence.  Random instant death.  Lots of
locations where there's nothing to do, and scenery not recognised by
the parser.  Exactly one object you can manipulate.

On the plus side, the first puzzle's actually quite good if you cut
away the misleading responses - I like the idea of dealing with a
situation when you (apparently) have nothing that can help you.  This,
however, is not enough to rescue the game.

Hooboy.

I tried to like this one (I really did!), but even after finishing it
I felt I had virtually no grasp of the world the author was attempting
to create.  It's fantasy, of course, but aside from the introduction,
there is virtually no text to help players learn more about the world
around them.  Most rooms are empty and useless, and many of them have
obscure pop-culture jokes that appear hopelessly out of place.

The major puzzles are quite illogical, and there's really no way of
figuring them out without the walkthrough, as there are no characters
to talk to or ancient tomes to consult.  The writing is unfortunately
quite atrocious, with every kind of spelling, grammar, punctuation,
and capitalization error imaginable, which makes it a chore to read.

The author seems reluctant to add new verbs to the grammar: Help
screens, footnotes, and some attempts at background information are
stored in a separate text file.  (Then again, I did the same thing
with MST3K1 last year, so I guess I'm not fit to cast the first stone
here.)

Perhaps this game might have turned out better in a longer format.  It
seems the author had a lot more to put into this game, but was daunted
by the two-hour limit.  I hope he's not overly discouraged by my
criticism here.  Hopefully the next release will feature better world-
building and the use of a spell-checker.

VERSION: Release 1

Not many works of IF are spellbinding or even compelling from
beginning to end; a game with a few memorable moments or some good
puzzles may be remembered fondly and replayed often, even if the rest
of the game is undistinguished. A notable example, to my mind, is
<a href = "s.html#sorcerer">Sorcerer</a>, the bulk of which is rather ho-hum but which features two
brilliant puzzles that most consider among Infocom's best ever. This
is not to suggest that Purple, Stefan Blixt's entry in the 1998
competition, is in Sorcerer's league; it's not. But as with that game
and others, an otherwise undistinguished entry is redeemed by a few
compelling moments and some intriguing ideas.

Nuclear holocaust is imminent, but your brother Karl is planning to
evade the blast and start over in the postapocalyptic world. To reveal
precisely what you do would, I think, spoil the best moments of
Purple: at its best, it has some of the austerity of well-imagined
post-holocaust science fiction, such as Walter Miller's Canticle for
Leibowitz; the way that remnants from the &quot;before&quot; turn up in the
&quot;after&quot; is sometimes rather chilling. Purple is, to be sure, not even
as well written as most average sci-fi, and certain moments go
underdescribed--but the spareness of the prose serves the author well
in spots. Descriptions are concise enough that they convey what
happens and let the player mentally fill in the details. There is one
moment at a turning point in the story that gave me a real chill--the
author handles a certain transition particularly well--and I was
disposed to like the game from that point on, I think.  There are
other things that are done well: a certain hidden object is nicely
clued, and the behavior of a certain NPC is well described.
Disturbing details are scattered here and there, rather than filling
every room description, suggesting a measure of restraint.

As indicated, however, the general quality of Purple is uneven at
best.  The writing hits several potholes, particularly in certain
events toward the end of the game, where it becomes difficult to tell
exactly what's going on. There are plenty of typos and spelling
problems, and a few places where the brevity of the descriptions
becomes confusing. Technical problems abound as well: there are a few
crashes, a major disambiguation problem, and one character who
consistently asks you for something no matter how often you give it to
him. More generally, several plot angles go unresolved--it would be
nice to see Purple extended or followed up to make some more sense of
the story. As it is, it's a little like a trailer: lots of intriguing
things happen, but it would be worth knowing more about them.

There are other problems. After a certain point, Purple's pacing
suffers: there aren't any time limits or even anything encouraging
haste for most of the game, which is a shame because a sense of
urgency might have made the plot more compelling. There are some
points where wander-around-and-explore is a good mood to set, but
after a while the exploratory feel needs to stop. Karl simply doesn't
have enough to say--he has a few interesting responses, but too many
things elicit no response, and his stable of comments is annoyingly
small. (His one major task receives so little description that the
effect is almost comic.) More generally, it's hard to escape the
feeling that the author needed another month to fill in the details of
Purple and clean up the bugs: if you deviate too much from the
author's storyline, the seams start to show.  (Particularly toward the
end, if you do things out of sequence.) Given that the game provides
minimal direction about what to do when, the effect can be a bit
confusing. The author provides plenty of interesting details in his
world, but never manages to make it seem coherent.

But Purple, I think, is greater than the sum of its parts, and the few
compelling moments made up for the many bugs and slip-ups. If lack of
polish bothers you, avoid this one; if you're so used to rough edges
that you've learned to look past them, and you haven't tried Purple,
you might appreciate the pieces of an interesting story that
occasionally appear amid the bugs. Though far from a resounding
success, Purple is a nice effort with some effective moments (and a
huge improvement over the author's Pintown from the previous year),
and I gave it a 7 in the competition.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag24.html">SPAG #24</a> -- March 24, 2001

TITLE: The Pyramids of Mars 
AUTHOR: Patrick Wigfull
EMAIL: ?
DATE: 1994
PARSER: AGT, sub-Inform
SUPPORTS/PLATFORM: AGT interpreters, comes with AGT runtime
AVAILABILITY: Freeware?, IF Archive

Being a fan of the BBC TV show, "Doctor Who", I was pleased to see this
in the archives. The game pays tribute to the show by adapting one
popular story from 1976 when the central character was played by Tom
Baker. This had a typical plot in that an ancient Egyptian god is
discovered to be a powerful alien intent on laying waste to whole
galaxies, yet the action centres around a quiet country house in 1911,
reminiscent of the H.P. Lovecraft influence common in IF. 

This particular story might seem a good candidate for adaptation due to
the technical puzzles that are solved, but in fact "do something
terribly clever" isn&#8217;t handled well by most parsers. Therefore Wigfull
has had to eliminate many of the obstacles of the TV series and replaced
them with some plausible alternatives that will work in an adventure
game while being in keeping with the original plot. So there&#8217;s still
plenty of challenge for people with reasonably clear memories of the
version released on video, although for people with no previous
knowledge there will be challenge in the substantive problems as well as
the minutiae. "Mars" is a faithful homage, which only Who obsessives
would think of picking holes in. It is unfortunate that some of the new
puzzles are very particular in their solution, e.g. "put gelignite on
equipment" is legal, but not useful. There are also several ways you
can get yourself into an unwinnable situation and have to restart. Most
players can cope with this, although when you have explored the
environment once, you have to wait for about 50 turns before events
unfold enough for you to really start the action.

The AGT interpreter for the PC that comes with this package gives a
divide-by-zero error probably due to higher processor speeds, but the
DA1 file runs reasonably well in AgiliTy except for a few
considerations. In particular the hint/help system doesn&#8217;t work, neither
do the cursor and function keys as described in the documentation, and
opening the front door (an unnecessary action in any case) generates an
infinite loop error.

IF has of course moved on considerably since this game was written. One
NPC here is very static, and may provide you with some useful
information, while the others are of the variety that may flit by for a
brief dramatic scene, although they get bumped off very early anyway.
The Scarman brothers could be developed much more, instead Laurence
unaccountably "sniffs the teapot" or "checks his fly". Most notable by
her absence is Sarah, the Doctor's companion in the TV story. It&#8217;s often
said of the TV companions that they were mostly there to ask stupid
questions so the Doctor could explain the plot to the viewer, and Sarah
was surplus to requirements here, but it was a shame the author did not
take the opportunity to develop the character&#8217;s role for its own sake.

VERSION: Release 2

I want to marry <a href = "g.html#galatea">Galatea</a>. This is something that should be got out in the
open, to avoid any later confusion. Galatea is stimulating, engaging,
fun, not to mention one of the greatest -- probably the single greatest
-- technical achievements in IF. And I want to marry her.

Sadly, there is nobody in Pytho's Mask who I want to marry. This is
probably a good thing. On the other hand, I do want to buy the palace
and live in it. These strange desires should probably be a cause for
concern and -- eventually -- expensive therapy; however, they do serve
to point one thing out: the tremendous talent of Emily Short.

There are other things that could point this out, of course. Things like
the bravura opening: a few lines of cryptic dialogue are followed by an
immediate scene-change, at which point you are engaged in conversation.
This is impressive. Not necessarily because of the technical difficulty
-- anyone can script an NPC to say a line -- but because of the sheer
cheek of it: how many IF authors are there who even encourage you to
converse with their NPCs, let alone draw your attention to them? 

Of course, this is done not out of cheek, but rather because this author
-- almost uniquely in IF -- can get away with it; Emily Short's NPCs are
far ahead of anyone else's, both technically and in terms of character.
In fact, that could be said to be the only problem with Pytho's Mask:
the technical aspects of this game represent such a leap ahead that the
other parts of the game seem occasionally to struggle to keep up. The
idea of combining ask/tell and menu-based conversation systems so as to
keep the fluidity of the first but the sense of the second was utterly
brilliant -- but there are many places where either so much has been
implemented that it is possible to simply get lost in conversation, or
others where the crucial topic is mysteriously lacking.

Is it unfair to judge Pytho's Mask like this? By any other author's
standards, the conversations in it are a hell of an achievement -- it's
just that this isn't any other author, this is the author responsible
for Galatea, and indeed the author responsible for this system. Not only
that, but everything else about the game is superb. What seems like a
slightly bizarre fantasy story rapidly settles into a whodunnit -- or
rather, whos-going-to-do-it -- with added love interest, both of which
are beautifully written and paced. The writing is good; the
implementation is deep (although with some gaps). The game is shortish,
but that isn't in itself a problem -- there's plenty packed in.
Generally, then, this is not quite a perfect game, but it's getting
pretty close.
