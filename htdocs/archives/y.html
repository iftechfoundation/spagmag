VERSION: Release 1



An utterly conventional and thoroughly delightful adventure game. I was

in a lousy mood when I started playing--I left the computer with a big

smile on my face. That is the highest praise I can give. 



Let's back up. YAGWAD is, as advertised, a game about a dragon. You're

an unlikely hero hoping to rescue the princess from the nefarious beast

and win the king's favor. So why did I love it, when so many games of

this sort merit only a yawn and a shrug? 



There are quite a few reasons. First and foremost, YAGWAD is the

funniest game I've played this year. From the rousing prologue (and

responses to "score" and "fullscore" therein), to the delightful ascii

art animation in the title, to the encyclopedia salesman (insert Monty

Python clip), to the friendly teeth, the troll, the answering machine,

the monks....well, I could go on all day. Suffice to say, YAGWAD kept me

grinning ear to ear from beginning to end. The humor is dead on,

comparable to Steve Meretzky's and often better. 



Programming is very solid. I ran into a few relatively harmless bugs,

and that's it (notable: I can read the diary without picking it up). The

writing is not the lush, purple prose of much story-based IF (don't get

me wrong--I like well-done purple prose!), but it is comfortable to

read, grammatical, and often funny. The room descriptions, in

particular, have an economy of expression reminiscent of Infocom. Few of

them span more than five lines, yet they lay out scenery and evoke a

mood with ease: 



   The forest stops short of this slope of mountainside, where a

   crumbling monastery stands with forlorn dignity overlooking the

   tangled remnants of an overgrown garden. A cracked stone walk winds

   from the forest opening north, through lank beds of herbs and

   wildflowers, and up to the wide stairs and darkened doorway leading

   west. 



The plot ties together neatly. In fact, figuring out exactly what

happened years ago to leave things in their current state is part of the

fun. It's impossible to put the game in an unwinnable state (a feat

which clearly required some extra programming), and there are no sudden

deaths. Puzzles are relatively simple, but fun to solve, and a few of

them are clever enough to yield that nifty "aha!" feeling when you think

of the answer. I especially liked the hilt-password puzzle, and when I

realized the solution to the final puzzle, I laughed aloud. It was just

perfect. 



Bottom line: YAGWAD is a polished gem. It was written by an author who

clearly knew what he was doing and took the time to do it right. 



"Digby McWiggle": Thank you for reminding this world-weary judge why she

fell in love with IF in the first place. 



Rating: 10

TITLE: You Are Here

AUTHOR: Roy Fisher

EMAIL: royhome SP@G powersufr.com

DATE: October 2001

PARSER: Inform Standard

SUPPORTS: any Inform interpreter

AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)

VERSION: Release 1



My competition rating: 7



This game is very odd in many respects. First, it is supposed to be a

promotion for a play about an online MUD or multi-user dungeon. Second,

it is actually a fairly complete simulation of a MUD, minus, of course,

real people. This makes sense as a MUD is really nothing more than a

souped up version of a text adventure. Most fall more towards the

role-playing and hack'n'slash types of activities than the storytelling

Interactive Fiction that most readers are accustomed to. So, I suspect

that this and the fact that the game tries to promote a play that few

would have gotten the chance to see, turned a lot of people off and

resulted in the relatively low rating. However, the thing that makes me

rate this game so highly is that I see it as a humorous jab at many of

the well-established traditions of IF. For example, the main quest in

the game is described by your companion as a "gather a bunch of

completely unrelated items Fed-X Quest." I suspect that the author had

played games like <a href = "a.html#arthur">Arthur</a>, where the plot fell into such a quest.



That isn't the only real bit of humor to be found. Virtually all the MUD

elements are here. There is a combat system similar to that in <a href = "b.html#bzork">Beyond

Zork</a>, except that all the monsters disappear in a cloud of black fog.

It's clear that the author put this in on purpose. You can use MUD-like

commands to list players, and the other NPCs sometimes talk out of

character or whisper so you can't hear them. Since the story is that you

are a guest player, you naturally are prevented from exploring at will,

and this device works well to keep the game small.



In this game, you choose your gender near the beginning by deciding

which armor you will wear. Like most of the Infocom games, this makes

little difference to the plot, but I strongly recommend playing as a

female and hanging around the little girl for awhile. There are some

really great little Easter Eggs when the other characters see you with

her. The remarks from Harrold, the companion you have during the

majority of the game, are a real hoot.



Since I've mostly written about the humor of the game, here is an actual

example. Like any town in an RPG type game, this town has a tavern. The

drinks, however, are unusually bad. This little bit of interaction

contains one of my favorite responses in the whole game.



   >ask bartender for mead

   The dwarf reaches behind him and grabs a seemingly indistinguishable

   bottle from the shelf. "A drink for northern ponces with horns," he

   says, pouring a small quantity into a stein and placing it on the

   counter. "I'll just put it on yer tab fer now."



   >drink mead

   It isn't as nice as you expected. It's made with genuine honey--you

   can tell from the floating bumblebee corpse you fished out from

   between your teeth--but it tastes more muddy than meady. You can't

   for the life of you think of why you'd want another. The stein itself

   disappears, part of a kingdom-wide initiative to "keep our enchanted

   forests clean!"



Well, the game isn't perfect, of course. There are several annoying

bugs. The most well-known and most complained about is the Changeling

bug. Basically, don't mess with the Changeling until you have an idea of

what to do with it. If this creature is attacked too early, the game can

be made unwinnable despite the author's claim to the contrary. Yes, this

is most likely a bug as Harrold makes it clear that this is a magical

creature that shouldn't be able to be killed normally. Another bug is

that typing "fill mug" will result in a string of "***programming

error***" messages. The author forgot to turn off debugging and strict

modes, a common mistake every since they are turned on by default. This

makes cheating possible, but I didn't do it.



There is no walkthrough for this game, but hints are available by

praying at the temple. Other than the bugs, it isn't that difficult and

has an ending that fits with the rest of the game quite nicely.



So, I recommend this game to experienced IF players who have played both

the best and worst of IF and like humor in a fairly easy, relaxing game.
