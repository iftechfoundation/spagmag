        There are a number of ways for authors to draw attention to their
games: by promoting them through newsgroups, web sites, and e-zines; by
creating a favorable (or unfavorable) impression on players, who spread it
by word of mouth; et cetera.  A more imaginative trick is to give the game
a name that places it dead last in an alphabetic directory listing on an
FTP archive, so it grabs attention by being the very last thing a user sees
when doing a &quot;dir&quot;.  Well, it worked on me, anyway.  The title I refer to is
&quot;Zanfar,&quot; an appellation that seems to have absolutely no significance in the
game itself, apart from the promotional scheme I've just outlined.
        In fact, there's very little about &quot;Zanfar&quot; that's significant.
Though it boasts 140 rooms, there just isn't much there.  Very few of the
rooms are more than padding, and it's painfully obvious what's important and
what's not (the game doesn't allow you to examine ANY scenery).  The
rudimentary plot simply tells you that you're someone who enjoys exploring
old houses like the one in the game, despite the fact that the locals warned
you there's something dangerous there.  Before long, though, you find out
that the whole thing is just another collect-all-the-treasures operation,
with no innovations to recommend it.
        The puzzles are so cheesy and cliched, they could have come out of a
white box labelled &quot;Acme Jenerik Advenchur Puzzuhlz.&quot;  Your exploits in
&quot;Zanfar&quot; range from obtaining a light source for dark rooms, to unlocking
things with keys (Did I say &quot;<A HREF="a.html#awe">The Awe-Chasm</A>&quot; had a lot of locks?  &quot;Zanfar&quot; has
even more!), to solving a drop-an-item-in-each-room maze, to dealing with a
group of cookie-cutter NPCs -- there's an enraged wizard, a &quot;Junk Food
Junkie,&quot; and a &quot;Humongeous [sic] Bat,&quot; to name a few.  All this is strung
together with wholly unremarkable writing.
        As a result, &quot;Zanfar&quot; is neither good enough to gain widespread
popularity nor awful enough to be a must-play for bad game aficionados.  It's
the kind of game that you forget all about a couple days after you solve it.
If nothing else, &quot;Zanfar&quot; deserves recognition as the most _ordinary_ text
adventure I've ever had the privilege(?) of having played.

VERSION: Beta Version 1.2

My first abandoned research complex game of the comp! Well, really it's
more of a prison, but you are an experimental subject so it's close. The
game was written last year just after the comp and the author has been
sitting on it since then. Can I be the first to say, "Don't do this."
Release what you've written! We want to play games all year round, not
just in October! 

As for the game itself, it is pretty slight. The author claims that it
shouldn't pose any problems for the player, yet almost immediately I was
fighting with the parser about disambiguation. This was an issue
throughout the game. The problem was especially severe with not being
able to refer to items by their adjectives. Scope was also handled
poorly, making it easy to refer to things that you can't see and
shouldn't know about. Similarly "take all from drawer" was parsed as
'take all'-including the drawer and my clothes. 

The writing was fine for the most part, though occasionally a bit over
the top. Design was less strong, such as a blocked door that leads back
to where you have already been and a padlock on which you can't try the
keys you find. In addition, I would have liked at least a little more
backstory. Who am I? How do I know the man is named Terry? Mystery is
all well and good but confusion is not.

Overall, Zero One was a competent text adventure, but, for me at least,
not particularly fun. I lacked all but the most basic motivation, and
the contrast between graphic violence and silly humor was off-putting as
well as mimesis breaking.

CHARACTERS: Very funny (1.7)   PUZZLES: Some bad choices (1.2)
MISC: Original concept, well executed (1.7)
OVERALL: 7.5

In premise and execution, Cody Sandifer's Zero Sum Game is a genuinely
funny send-up of an adventure game (Pork, eat your heart out) and
perhaps the funniest work of IF since C.E. Forman <a href = "d.html#detectmst">MSTed
Detective</a>. Your mission: you have completed an average hack-and-slash
adventure game, but when you come home, your mother sends you out to
undo everything you've done. The goal is therefore to lose all 75
points you have at the start of the game, by unslaying a dragon,
giving back treasures, and making good all your dirty deeds. That you
frequently have to do more dirty deeds along the way is, of course,
part of the humor.

Humorous enough as a concept, but there's more: you get a sidekick
named Maurice the Follower (when commanded to do something salacious:
&quot;Maurice can't spring to your aid if he's busy doing that!&quot;) who
invariably refers to himself in the third person and provides running
commentary on everything in the game. And I mean everything:
periodically, Maurice exclaims &quot;Oh boy! Look at the size of this [room
name]!&quot;, which has quite the effect when it comes along in the
location named Dirt Patch. Though Maurice is only minimally useful, it
is advised that the player keep him around as long as possible to hear
his various contributions. My personal favorite Maurice line, when
accompanied by a nasty character:

    Maurice claps.  &quot;Hooray for goodness!  Down with evil!&quot;
    Irritated, Darlene glances sharply in Maurice's direction.
    &quot;Um,&quot; stumbles Maurice.  &quot;Maurice is shutting up now.&quot;

The comedy in Zero Sum Game extends well beyond Maurice. (When you try
to give something to a dead character: &quot;I bet you also loan money to
trees.&quot;)  The antiheroic &quot;hero&quot; character affords some humor in his or
her own right (the gender varies with yours, which you choose at the
beginning), stalking around killing everything in sight in a fashion
reminiscent of many a combat-based role-playing game. (And berating
his or her big toe for its interference.) There's even a sex scene of
sorts (or a series of them), played for laughs rather than thrills,
naturally. As with Mr.  Sandifer's most recent work, &quot;<a href = "e.html#parade">Everybody Loves
a Parade</a>,&quot; there are numerous particularized lines for ho-hum
commands, notably &quot;kiss&quot;, whose generic response is &quot;You're not
attracted to [character] in that secret special way&quot; but which draws a
wide variety of funny lines in certain situations.

The glitches in Zero Sum Game mostly arise from the puzzles. For one
thing, there are many opportunities to make the game unfinishable,
many of them merely from doing things out of sequence; the player is
advised to save often, since many of the key developments are a bit
hard to foresee.  One puzzle can even be solved &quot;wrong&quot; -- you'll get
the points, but you won't be able to finish the game -- which is a bit
irritating. Even though the game is short enough that restarting it is
not a major hassle, the gameplay problems detract a bit from the
overall enjoyability. There are also numerous small illogicalities --
you steal an object and its owner doesn't notice, though he does if
you show up carrying it; you can't take an object from Maurice, even
if he follows you around slavishly; the superstrong hero can't break
an old rusty padlock. Logic is not a major factor in humorous games,
of course, but then again that's one of the drawbacks of humorous
games (witness <a href = "b.html#bureau">Bureaucracy</a>, one of the hardest games Infocom ever
produced simply because the puzzles all required Douglas Adams logic),
and Zero Sum Game suffers from that problem.

Small problems aside, this is certainly one of the best of this year's
competition, and without a doubt one of the most consistently
enjoyable; even with the gameplay problems, I still thought it merited
a 9.


From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag13.html">SPAG #13</a> -- February 5, 1998

Zero Sum Game (hereafter called &quot;ZSG&quot;) is like the proverbial apple
which is shiny & enticing on the outside, but inside is rapidly
rotting away.  The game starts with a fun premise: You've won. You've
collected treasures and solved puzzles, and now (before the first move
of the game) you're bringing them home to your mother. Unfortunately,
she doesn't approve of theft and killing and other such goings on, and
orders you to go back and put right all the wrongs you've
committed. Thus the game's name: you try to bring your score down to
zero before your moves (5000 of them) run out.  This could have been a
fun romp of reverse thinking, or an interesting exploration of the
morality of the traditional stock adventurer character, or even
both. As it turns out, the game doesn't really succeed on either
count.

The main problem that I had with ZSG is that it takes a much more
callous approach to cruelty (no, not Zarfian cruelty. Real
cruelty. [No offense, Andrew -- yours feels pretty real at the time.])
than I'm comfortable with. SPAG has a no-spoiler policy, so it's
difficult to provide concrete examples of this problematic
tendency. Suffice it to say that in order for the player to reach the
solution, several harmless and friendly creatures within the game must
be killed, sometimes in grotesque ways. These (and other) scenes make
it apparent that the author has not taken a thoughtful, mature
approach to the implications of his theme. That's OK -- not everything
has to be thoughtful and mature. But ZSG reached such a level of
cruelty that it wasn't much fun either. Dead bodies piled up in
proportions comparable to any hack-and-slash MUD, and even though
there's a resurrection spell in the game, you can't use it to revive
any of the dozens of dead elves and villagers, or any of the other
beings killed in the game (with one partial exception). The game's
ending provides the final barb. Without giving away too much, I'll
just say that it inflicts some arbitrary punishment on you, not as
penance for your crimes, but because you're a &quot;mama's boy&quot; (or girl,
as the case may be.)

To give it its due, ZSG does have a clever premise, a promising start,
and some good puzzles. Some of these puzzles have no particular moral
bent, but are cleverly designed. Others in fact do have the particular
ethical direction of reversing wrongs: you give the candy back to the
baby, for example. That's why it left such a bad taste in my mouth to
learn that other puzzles required coldly slaughtering your friends for
the sake of a few points. I learned this from the walkthrough -- I had
already thought of the &quot;killing&quot; solution to one puzzle, but couldn't
believe it was the right thing to do until I heard it from the author
himself. After that point, I detached from the game, using the
walkthrough to see the whole thing and make notes for this review. It
didn't get better. Zero Sum Game's gimmick is one that works best the
first time it is used -- too bad this game did such a poor job of
using it.

Prose: The prose in ZSG is actually pretty good. It's what enabled me
to become a little affectionate about Maurice and Chippy before I had
to slaughter them. Still, much like the rest of the game, the prose is
a good tool used for the wrong purpose. It's like a beginning
carpenter using the best quality wood -- the result may look pretty,
but it falls apart much too easily.

Plot: I think this is a game that doesn't know what it wants to be
about.  After the competition ended, the author posted to rgif that in
fact there was a &quot;larger purpose&quot; to the cruelty in ZSG, and that he
was trying to do a number of things, including explore 1st person
morality in IF, and to spoof the traditional treasure hunt in a funny,
absurd, and extreme way.  It's interesting to know this, and also to
know that for a number of people, the game worked. Still, maybe I'm
overly sensitive (or taking things too seriously), but it didn't work
for me. The game's arbitrary limits force brutal answers to trivial
problems -- not a very powerful exploration of the concepts the author
claims to have had in mind. The plot is a wandering mess, ending in a
big &quot;piss off&quot; to its player.  Unsatisfying and unpleasant.

Puzzles: The puzzles represented both the best and the worst things
about ZSG. On the one hand, the first couple of puzzles I solved (the
baby and the key) were really clever and interesting, and they raised
my expectations from the already high level achieved by the game's
premise.  Unfortunately, the excitement of these only intensified the
letdown of consulting the walkthrough and discovering what cold
solutions were required for the other puzzles. It's a pity that the
game didn't keep a consistent tone throughout -- I was much more
disappointed than I would have been had all the puzzles required nasty
measures to solve.

Technical:
writing -- I only found one grammar error in the entire text, a
misplaced modifier.

coding -- The coding was relatively coherent, though there was one
major problem: the warning system was a complete failure. To test it,
I ate the candy, killed the merchant, and killed Maurice in the first
few turns of the game. No response. Other than that, I found no major
bugs.

VERSION: 1997 competition release

I love the beginning of Zombie!. In it, you play Valerie, a junior at
the local college who is enjoying a relaxing camping trip after having
finally dumped her loser boyfriend Scott. The atmosphere of the
camping trip is very well-done, from the CD player spinning 80s hits
to the various characters squabbling over how to build a
campfire. Equally well-done is the terror of learning that there is
something awful lurking in those woods, and it's coming to get
you. You run, but to no avail: you are overtaken and killed... and
then the prologue is over and you find yourself in your actual role:
that of Scott, the unlucky guy who has just been dumped by his
heartless girlfriend Valerie, ridden his motorcycle out into the
country to get his mind off the breakup, and (wouldn't you know it?)
run out of gas in the remote woods. The viewpoint shift caught me
off-guard, and it worked marvelously. I felt like I had a better
insight into my character after having seen him through the eyes of
another, and vice versa for the character I played in the
prologue. Viewpoint shifts in traditional fiction can make for a
dramatic effect; interactive fiction, with its customary second person
form of address, made the shift all the more dramatic, at least this
time. It also serves perfectly to crank up the tension: one of the
first things you hear with Scott's ears is a scream -- it sounds like
Valerie, but what would she be doing out here in the woods?

Unfortunately, after this promising beginning Zombie! stumbles
badly. For one thing, after taking so much time to develop the
relationship between Valerie and Scott, the game never returns to it!
I fully expected to see Valerie show up again as a zombie, to see
Scott's emotional reaction to encountering her in that state, and to
find out what happens after he rescues her from zombification. A
reunion, perhaps? Well, no. In fact, the prologue is the last we see
of Valerie. Now, I usually like it when a game proves itself less
predictable than I thought it would be, but this time I felt
cheated. I wouldn't have paid so much attention to Valerie or put so
much time into learning about the relationship had I realized that she
was just a throwaway character. Doubly unfortunate is the fact this is
far from Zombie!'s only problem. There are numerous bugs in the code,
hand-in-hand (as they so often are) with an unpleasantly high count of
mechanical errors in the writing.

I kept finding myself feeling frustrated, because every time I really
got into the game, allowed myself to get interested in its tensions, a
bug or a spelling error would come along that would shatter mimesis
and deflate the emotional effect. The thing is, the game does a great
job of building that tension. It's a b-movie all the way, no deep or
serious issues here, but it's definitely got that suspenseful, creepy
feeling that the best b-movies have. (Yes, I'm aware of the irony in
that phrase, so you needn't bother pointing it out.) The sound of
heavy footsteps approaching, or the feeling of driving rain beating
against a worn, gothic mansion, or the sight of horrific creatures
staring dead ahead (literally!), and similar gothic pleasures were all
very well-executed in this game, until you hit the inevitable
technical error. Still, better to have a good game with lots of bugs
than a mediocre game executed flawlessly. Bugs are easy to fix. When
Starkey fixes them, Zombie! will definitely be one to recommend.

Prose: The prose isn't beautiful by any means, and it often shows
signs of awkward construction or phrasing. On the other hand, it does
achieve many suspenseful moments, and quite often has some very nice
pieces of description or atmosphere. I found the rain very convincing,
and the eerie outside of the mansion was also well-portrayed. In
addition, the prologue had some well-done dialogue and atmosphere, and
built the tension just right for entry into the game proper.

Plot: The plot was a good combination of the spooky and the silly,
with the emphasis on the silly. I found it reminiscent of some of the
early LucasArts games, especially the moments with Ed the Head. The
kitschy charm of the mad scientist, his lumbering assistant, the
haunted mansion, the unholy army of the dead, etc. was great. The main
disappointment I had with the plot was the ending. It felt tacked on,
as if there were more story to tell but because the game is a
competition entry the author didn't have time to explore it. Also, as
I mentioned above, the emphasis placed on Valerie was rather odd
considering that she never again showed up in the game. I also felt a
little frustrated by the ending. I don't want to give too much away,
except to say that it managed neither the triumphant feeling of
destroying evil nor the spooky feeling of inevitable defeat.

Puzzles: I actually liked the puzzles in Zombie! quite a bit. Some of
them were a little tacked on (the measuring cups), and the overall
puzzle framework (collect the elements of a recipe) is quite shopworn
by now.  However, all the puzzles, cliched as they may have been, fit
very well into the overall story, and that seamless fit makes a lot of
things pretty forgivable. If the game hadn't been plagued by bugs, its
puzzles would have come very close to achieving the goal of aiding the
narrative rather than obstructing it.

Technical:
writing -- There were a significant number of mechanical errors in
Zombie!'s writing.

coding -- The game also had quite a number of bugs. It needs at least
one round of intense playtesting before it's really ready for the
world at large.

OVERALL: 6.7

The original <a href = "#zorktril">Zork series</a> was probably best described as treasure hunt
with a satirical touch: there was humor here and there, but most of
the plot was straightforward adventure/fantasy, and elements of the
ridiculous were added only sparingly. Not so in Steve Meretzky's
followup, Zork Zero, a &quot;prequel&quot; that subordinated the adventure
aspect to over-the-top camp--and while it works in many ways, fans of
the austere feel of the original series may find it a bit jarring.

As a game that purports to explain some of the confusing backstory
that had swirled around the various Zork entries, Zork Zero is
admirable. The documentation--&quot;Lives of the Twelve Flatheads&quot;--is
extensive and very funny, and the game is awash in amusing details
about Dimwit's excessive tastes. (For example: &quot;This is a small
closet. Well, it's small by the standards of this castle; in a pinch,
it could probably sleep a few regiments.&quot;) Though I would have liked a
few more nuggets about how and why various elements of the trilogy
came to be, there are more than enough--including the origin of the
white house--to keep the Zork fan entertained for a while on that
score. The various Flathead siblings and their professions--Ralph
Waldo Flathead, J. Pierpont Flathead, etc.--are also well rendered,
though I was a bit disappointed that there was only one woman among
them, Lucrezia Flathead. C'mon, Steve. Couldn't you come up with any
other notable women in history to parody? (My pick would have been
Joan of Flathead, though I guess the history would have been hard to
rewrite.) Typically of later Infocom works, additionally, the copy
protection is woven into the documentation, which provides several
unguessable actions. (A few of them, though--such as the 400-floor
building with an item on a certain floor mentioned in the
materials--feel a little gratuitous.)

The plot, though ostensibly serious, is largely a romp. The game
tosses you into the fall of the Great Underground Empire, as the
descendant of a witness of Dimwit Flathead's death at the hands of the
wizard Megaboz and Megaboz's curse on the empire, and the heir to a
fragment of parchment that might provide a clue to averting the
curse. 94 years have passed since the curse was imposed and the day
has arrived, and it is now up to you to break the curse by finding two
items belonging to each Flathead and adding them to the wizard's
cauldron. The items have now been scattered to the winds, many in
rather improbable places, though there is some logic to the location
of virtually all of them. You might think that saving the empire is a
grave responsibility, but this is a Steve Meretzky game, and virtually
everything in it is there for laughs. Items you acquire include a
&quot;ring of ineptitude&quot; and an &quot;anti-pit bomb&quot;, obstacles come in the
form of whimsical word or logic games, and a central piece of the
geography is a giant brogmoid. Indeed, the player may justifiably
wonder why he or she is bothering to save the empire anyway, since
everyone else has cleared out.

The setting is relentlessly silly: Zork Zero is set less in a fantasy
universe than in a Meretzky world. The bits of swords and sorcery that
pervaded the original trilogy give way to absurdism (occasionally a
tad adolescent; earwax and toe fungus are pivotal in one puzzle). In
one scene, you stumble into an &quot;Inquisition&quot; in which you outwit the
executioner with wordplay; in another, you deal with a massive,
obnoxious talking toad. Centering the action on a castle full of
absurdities is the perfect game idea for Meretzky, but the result is
less fantasy than mock-fantasy--whereas the original trilogy used
fantasy conventions while mocking them, Zork Zero uses only a few of
them and mocks them in such ridiculous ways that it's easy to forget
that it's mockery at all. The result is that the humor is less
effective than that of many of Infocom's earlier games, oddly, since
it's more or less trying to be funny start to finish, while the humor
in <a href = "#zork1">Zork I</a>, say, came from an occasional fourth-wall one-liner.

Perhaps the most peculiar element of Zork Zero is the puzzles. There
are some clever and original ones, certainly--particularly one
involving a certain chessboard--but most are classic logic puzzles
cribbed directly into the game. There is, for example, a Towers of
Hanoi puzzle--thoroughly frustrating to wade through for those of us
who already know the idea--and a &quot;lady or the tiger&quot; problem, and a
Hi-Q game, and even a measure-out-the-fluid-with-two-different-
size-vessels puzzle. Suffice it to say that, when you encounter a fox
and a rooster in close proximity, it's fairly obvious that a certain
crossing-the-river puzzle lurks somewhere in the game. The problem
with this isn't that they're poorly done, because most of them succeed
brilliantly (and many are adapted to the context); several games are
represented in full-color VGA graphics, even. It's just that a set of
minds as creative as those of Infocom shouldn't need to copy so many
puzzles from the canon. Still, in that this is a long game with lots
of puzzles--virtually every object of significance, and there are
many, requires some sort of puzzle-solving to obtain--the derivative
aspect isn't as troubling as it might be. Most of the puzzles are
relatively straightforward, though a few require rather exact timing,
and it is sometimes possible to lock yourself out of victory merely by
lack of foresight regarding transportation. (Zork Zero does employ one
of the niftiest transportation devices in all of Infocom, though, and
though the game area is fairly vast, proper use of the device can keep
the player moving around it at a rapid rate.)

Technically, Zork Zero is spectacular. The graphics are not
extensive--pillars framing the screen, most of the time--but there are
more elaborate displays here and there, and the details of the pillars
change with the setting. The games you play require changing graphical
displays, an edition of the Encyclopedia Frobozzica has illustrated
entries, and a mysterious rebus (with a bizarre twist) is a crucial
part of one puzzle--and the graphics are more than adequate for
figuring it out. The parser is up to the standard of Infocom's later
games, with the inclusion of function keys that can stand in for
common commands. (Since this is a Steve Meretzky game, one of the
defaults is &quot;give magic locket to moose.&quot;) There is an internal hint
system (non-adaptive) which takes care to preserve the copy protection
and even makes fun of you if you resort to it too often. As if to
showcase the parser's disambiguation abilities, in fact, the game
includes two sets of scaled objects--for example, there is a large
fly, a larger fly, an even larger fly, and the largest fly. Liquids
are skillfully coded several times over, and the transportation system
mentioned above, which offers seemingly infinite bug possibilities,
works flawlessly.

But technical wizardry isn't enough to overcome the game's basic
incoherence: though the finale is impressive and suitably surprising,
the game meanders considerably before that because it doesn't really
have anywhere to go. When your plot simply requires that you pick up
24 random objects, it's hard to develop the plot along the way, and
the one significant opening up of new territory isn't enough to really
draw the player into the game. There isn't, in other words, enough
payoff for most of your accomplishments; usually, you simply get
another item to toss into the cauldron. Zorks I and II, though
treasure hunts as well, restricted the initial area available far more
than Zork Zero does, and conditioned more discovery on solving
significant puzzles. Here, solving three puzzles, all of them easy,
will allow access to virtually every room in the game. In moving away
from the Zork trilogy's conventional-fantasy roots, therefore, Zork
Zero loses something of what makes conventional fantasy compelling:
danger, discovery, the intrigue of what might be next.  Here, there's
never really any question about what you'll find, merely where you'll
find it, and the fun therefore turns to the puzzles--which deliver in
some cases but not all.

Certainly, Meretzky's writing is witty and helps to counteract the
traipsing-to-and-fro aspect; there are plenty of silly things to try
(documented by a &quot;have you tried&quot; section) and funny discoveries. But
over the course of 1500 turns, which is what the average player could
easily end up spending to solve this, even the best writing begins to
pall--and the comic relief in the form of the jester becomes tiresome
long before the end. (The jester has an irritatingly small stable of
jokes, and many of them have annoying side effects--for instance, he
occasionally turns you into an alligator for several turns, meaning
that you drop everything and you have to pick it all up and put on the
items you were wearing.  Alternately, a bat might come along and whisk
you to somewhere distant.  The appeal of all this wanes considerably
after a while, and the spectacular payoff can't overcome the tedium of
getting there. Given the amount of story underlying Zork Zero, it's
strange how little of it comes out in the game (until the finale,
anyway); it doesn't seem that it would have been impossible to
discover interesting things about the Flatheads or about Megaboz that
shape your quest and draw the player into finding out more. As it is,
until the last few moves, what you see is largely what you get.

There are entertaining moments in Zork Zero, to be sure. It's
questionable whether there are enough to keep the average player
interested throughout, though, and to whatever extent it succeeds, it
does so in a very different way from any of the other Zork entries.
Though it has its moments, I found Zork Zero the weakest of all
Infocom's text Zork games.

VERSION: Release 88

Consideration of the relative merits of Zork I, in 1997, is difficult
to undertake fairly. Infocom's achievement in publishing such a game
in 1981 -- to fit the limitations of tiny microcomputers, in a
language that they had written themselves -- was considerable, and
flaws in the game cannot be considered in the same critical light as
those of games written today. Numerous bugs have been corrected since
the original release, but the game is still essentially the same --
none of the bugs addressed design flaws that affected the plot or
structure of the game; its limitations were not serious enough to
warrant fundamental changes.

Nor was the popularity of Zork I a fluke. Novelty was part of its
appeal, certainly, and the game suffers in comparison to later, more
polished efforts, but the attempt to create a plausible game
environment with only text was sufficiently successful that many, many
people were genuinely absorbed -- by the challenge of the puzzles and
by the story, such as it is.  The versatility of the parser was
doubtless part of it -- to get the true experience of playing
Infocom's games in the early '80s, struggle through some Scott Adams
or the like and its volume of &quot;go tree&quot; and &quot;look rock&quot; commands. The
primitiveness of the game environment of Adams and the like is not an
indictment, given cost and size limitations, but the wizardry of
Infocom in overcoming those limitations should be recognized through
the comparison as near genius.

Graeme Cree's bug list inventories some of the design flaws of Zork I,
some of which have been corrected, some not. My personal favorite,
from the first release, involves &quot;give troll to troll,&quot; whereupon the
troll eats himself and disappears. There are some problems that live
on, though -- for example, the player is given an extensive
description of the jewel-encrusted egg upon first encountering it, but
that description can never be reached again once the egg is moved --
it began with &quot;In the bird's nest...&quot;, but the rest of the description
relates only to the egg and would be relevant in any setting. Some of
the synonyms are a bit off -- &quot;examine passage&quot; yields &quot;there's
nothing special about the way.&quot;

Among the stranger red herrings are the tool chests at the dam, which
&quot;are so rusty and corroded that they crumble when you try to touch
them,&quot; and they certainly do crumble -- after that response, the
chests are gone, apparently melting into dust and blowing away. There
are numerous small illogicalities -- how does one raise and lower a
basket up and down a mine shaft from the bottom of that shaft? Remote
control? How does it happen to be that one inevitably happens upon a
small object when digging in a room, without prior guidance? Is the
thief really so clever -- or are you really so dumb -- that he can
steal your light source? Why is it that a room filling up with water
obligingly stops filling and waits for you to return if you leave?

Many of the rules that IF players have come to expect designers to
follow came about as a result of bad experiences with the early games,
and Zork I is no exception. Though the inclusion of alternate
solutions to problems is welcome, some of the alternate paths are a
bit strange -- it is handy to know the shortcut to the thief's
hideaway, but there is no way of guessing that shortcut without taking
the long, arduous route, and players might well feel they have been
put through needless aggravation. There are quite a few save-restore
puzzles -- the &quot;squeaky sounds&quot; are hardly adequate warning for the
bat puzzle, nor is it obvious that you, the player, will be so dumb as
to puncture the boat by boarding it with a sword or other sharp
object. The maze is large and irritating -- and the addition of the
thief to the mix, while an amusing innovation on Colossal Cave, makes
things worse. And most frustrating of all, of course, is the
randomized combat, with no way to improve your chances -- an element
that Infocom largely set aside after Zork I, thankfully.

The writing is somewhat uneven, frankly. There are many rooms whose
descriptions are cursory -- whereas <a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a> had clearly drawn on
explorers' accounts of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky in its attention to
geological detail, providing a measure of realism, there are many Zork
I descriptions like this: &quot;This is a circular stone room with passages
in all directions. Several of them have unfortunately been blocked by
cave-ins.&quot; Such a variety of settings comes in such a short space --
chasm, canyon, lake -- and with so little description that the reality
of the environment suffers at time. Most room descriptions begin with
something like &quot;You are in a small room,&quot; which says little. Like, how
small, man?  Bread-box? Closet? There are moments of fairly thorough
description in largely irrelevant locales, notably the canyon outside,
and there are places where the descriptions are so terse that one
wonders whether the intent was humor:

        Land of the Dead

        You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of
        lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. In the corner are
        stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers less
        fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north.

Here I am in Hades. *yawn* Wonder if there's a gift shop around. Well,
back to the adventure. Examining the remains elicits the response &quot;You
see nothing special about the pile of bodies.&quot; But though Zork I had
little of the atmosphere that would mark later Infocom efforts, the
very spareness of its prose was sometimes effective, as in the Troll
Room:

        This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a
        forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches
        (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

        A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all
        passages out of the room.

        Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

Where a more thorough description of blood and gore might have seemed
excessive, the brief reference to &quot;bloodstains and deep scratches&quot;
allows the imagination to conjure up the scene -- and the description
followed by the mention of the troll, while provided to separate out
objects from scenery, heightens the effect of first impression -- the
ominous decor -- and sudden realization of the source of that decor,
as if the player were peering around the room and saw the troll
last. Equally effective is the experience of dying once past a certain
point in the game and wandering around as a ghost -- being told that
your hand passes through objects, finding exits from the dungeon
barred; the feel is reminiscent of Sartre's &quot;Les jeux sont faits.&quot;
Though the lack of an endgame seems strange to experienced IF players,
the final reference to the sequel is genuinely tantalizing.

Zork I does work, in the end, though it's hard to pinpoint just why.
Collect-the-treasures as a plot is a weary old device, and it doesn't
only seem that way to IF players -- it had, after all, been the
subject of innumerable fantasy novels and games before IF hit the
scene. But its recurring presence points to some appeal that Zork I
managed to tap into -- the allure of getting rich, and of obtaining
things as diverse as the coffin of Ramses II, a songbird's bauble, and
a dead adventurer's bag of coins, keeps the intrigue of finding the
next treasure alive, somehow.  Vital to the enterprise is, of course,
the humor, even if the barrage of self-reference becomes wearying;
responses like &quot;Only Santa Claus climbs down chimneys&quot; make the game
feel more intelligent than a &quot;You can't do that&quot; response would have,
and moments like the description of the vampire bat and the behavior
of the thief break up the traipsing-from-room-to-room feel that
sometimes plagued Colossal Cave. For my part, I still enjoy this
response:

        &gt;zork

        At your service!

The variety of responses to &quot;jump&quot; -- a command with, of course, no
practical value in the game -- and the provision for other
nonessential verbs points to the pains that Infocom took from the very
beginning to make the environment genuinely interactive, rather than
the minimum of nouns and commands needed to get the player through the
game. The value of that is hard to measure, but Zork I, with its many
Easter eggs, is a good example of a game that felt worth the price
because of its breadth -- much to do, many responses to try.

Playing Zork I now is indeed worthwhile, both to see how far IF has
come and to appreciate its origins, despite the annoyances. It is a
credit to its design that it remains an enjoyable game, well worth its
popularity.

Zork II picks up where its predecessor left off in many ways -- the
beginning deposits you inside the barrow that had marked the end of
<a href = "#zork1">Zork I</a>, your trusty lamp and sword are by your side, and your mission
seems at the outset to be more treasure-gathering. But Zork II parts
company with the first of the series in a variety of important ways as
the game progresses -- that sword is useful, but in a way far more
interesting than hack-and-slash -- and the changes suggest that the
folks at Infocom were interested less in putting out more of the same
than in refining their product and heightening ths challenge.

One way in particular that the designers of Zork II chose to raise the
difficulty level bears mention because it seems to have been deemed a
failure as a game device, and rightly so: the reliance on random
events.  Two major elements of Zork II are random -- the role of the
Wizard and the function of the Carousel Room -- and while each can be
disabled over the course of the game, each makes the normal course of
gameplay rather tiresome while active. An ill-timed Wizard appearance
can actually render the game unwinnable at several points, making Zork
II the only Infocom game I can think of (well, Zork I had randomized
combat, true, but unforeseeable random events -- meaning save-restore
cannot be relied upon in the same way as with combat -- are different)
where one can lose the chance to finish a game through no fault of
one's own. Usually, this happens because his spells disrupt a
time-dependent sequence that only happens once (actually, I just
discovered that becoming the object of a &quot;float&quot; spell in the volcano
spells death, though an amusing death), but there is one spell which,
if cast, instantly cuts off the possibility of winning, in a way that
the player could not possibly be expected to guess. This is a cruel
trick indeed, and later Infocom games eschew unfairness of this sort
-- but first-time players of Zork II should be warned that frequent
saves are in order.

While the plot, as noted, seems at first to be an extension of the
scavenger theme, it turns out to be something quite different; the
treasures have a use that marks a change in emphasis of sorts for your
character, from gathering booty to exploring the deeper recesses of
the cave -- and in that, perhaps, one might say that the plot thickens
slightly over the course of the game. The paragraph at the end of the
game suggests a larger mission, one that will come as a surprise to
the merry treasure-hunter -- and yet it makes some sense, in that it
suggests that the valor the player has demonstrated in getting that
far points to a more important goal.

Magic is prevalent in Zork II, more so than in the original,
appropriately so since it is a wizard's domain that you are exploring
-- and the progress of the game moves you from object and victim of
the magic to its controller, to some extent at least, in that you
outwit a variety of magical traps and learn to use some magic items to
your own ends. The magic is haphazard -- no hint of the more organized
system of the <a href = "e.html#enchanttril">Enchanter trilogy</a> -- but there is a real sense by the
end that you, the unskilled but savvy adventurer, have beaten the
wizard at his own game, and it helps deepen the admittedly thin sense
of a plot. Magic is also played up for humor value, including the
wizard's failed spells (&quot;There is a loud crackling sound, and blue
smoke rises from the wizard's sleeve. He sighs and disappears.&quot;) and
such sidelights as the &quot;fudge&quot; spell. (Though I was hoping that there
would be amusing applications of the power you gain toward the end of
the game, and I didn't find many.)

Several of the puzzles are lifted from the original &quot;Dungeon&quot;
mainframe game, though most of that had ended up in Zork I. (Though,
at one point, you see, from a distance, a location that had existed in
Dungeon but had dropped out of Zork I -- slightly confusing to the
uninitated.) One of the puzzles has a drastically different -- and
much more creative -- solution than in the original &quot;Dungeon&quot; game,
though it's more a &quot;wonder what happens if I do this&quot; solution than an
&quot;oh, I know, I should do this&quot; solution. The quality of the puzzles is
uneven: one requires some trial and error, amusing in its effects when
you get it wrong but trial and error all the same. The Bank of Zork
puzzle has drawn some criticism for being possible to solve without
fully understanding, though the rationale behind it is elegant enough
that it seems a minor problem -- and another puzzle requires that one
largely set aside one's knowledge of how liquids work (meaning that
what I suspect was supposed to be among the easier puzzles stumped me
completely when I first played the game).

There is, of course, one notoriously bad puzzle toward the end -- bad
for its &quot;guess-what-I'm-thinking&quot; aspect and for its inaccessibility
to the non-American -- and for pretending to be a maze when not
one. And the final puzzle is, I think, ridiculously hard -- the
required action is motivationless and the game gives not the slightest
nudge in the right direction. Infocom rated Zork II &quot;advanced,&quot; but
their sense of how to make a game hard without making it unfair was as
yet not fully developed.

Zork II feels much more polished than Zork I; the geography of the
game is somewhat more coherent, there are fewer illogicalities, and
the layout is less a series of puzzles than a set of locations that
revolve -- literally -- around a central area. The writing --
substantially better than that of Zork I -- confirms that impression;
there are virtually no rooms without a complete description, and at
times the writer manages to paint quite a vivid picture. The tunnel at
the beginning, while otherwise irrelevant, draws the reader in
effectively and provides atmosphere and attention to detail that had
been absent in the first game; it's as if the player has become less
intent on treasure and more apt to notice the surroundings now and
again. There are many locations worth picturing in one's own mind in
the course of Zork II, this among them:

        North End of Garden

        This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the
        cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a
        cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of
        glowing mosses on the roof of the cave.  A break in the hedge
        is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path
        leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open
        structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo.

And this:

        Menhir Room

        This is a large room which was evidently used once as a
        quarry. Many large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around
        the room. Some are rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and
        well-finished. One side of the room appears to have been used
        to quarry building blocks, the other to produce menhirs
        (standing stones). Obvious passages lead north and south.

        One particularly large menhir, at least twenty feet tall and
        eight feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark
        opening leading southwest. On this side of the menhir is
        carved an ornate letter &quot;F&quot;.

Providing the salient details as the player looks around the room
makes the experience more real and adds to the illusion of stumbling
on a world rather than a series of puzzles; many of the most memorable
images or scenes in the trilogy are in Zork II simply because the game
authors gave the settings so much attention. (When I first played this
-- I was 7 -- I had dreams about the Bank of Zork.) Even the
after-death sequence was intriguing, and points to mysteries that
unravel as the game progresses.  Part of the appeal of the writing in
Zork II is that it genuinely felt like a series of caves, with
geological detail noted and occasional references to a natural light
source.

In summary, the appeal of playing Zork II lies less in the puzzles
than in the game environment, and this installment is best enjoyed at
a measured pace, with time to read room descriptions and visualize the
scene. Notable for the way it changes the feel of the series, Zork II,
despite its flaws, points to Infocom's developing skills.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag12.html">SPAG #12</a> -- December 13, 1997

NAME: Zork III
E-MAIL: One of the world's great mysteries
DATE: 1983
PARSER: Early Infocom
SUPPORTS: Infocom ports
AVAILABILITY: Commercial (Masterpieces)
URL: N/A
VERSION: Release 17

To say merely that Zork III represents a departure from the first two
entries in the series is to understate the case. Though much in this
game will be familiar to the experienced Infocom gamer, and though it
resolves the series reasonably coherently, Zork III works on a
thoroughly different premise from the first two -- and to the extent
that it succeeds, it does because the player is willing to set aside
expectations built up by Zorks I and II.

This is not, of course, to say that Zork III is a letdown, or not an
enjoyable game, but it is hardly enjoyable on the same terms as the
other parts of the series. The humor, to take an obvious example, is
subordinate to the story in Zork III and appears at odd moments,
Easter eggs typical of Infocom's writing (listening to the guards in
the museum is a good example, or reading the plaque in the Jewel Room
after you solve the puzzle). But there is little humor in the
storyline itself -- nothing, for example, along the lines of cakes
that cause you to evaporate, or wizards casting spells like &quot;Fudge,&quot;
or thieves making sardonic remarks, or a room that mocks mocks your
your syntax syntax until until solved solved. There is one slightly
jokey puzzle, true, but the game doesn't really play up the humorous
aspect as it might; it is the resolution to a problem that is, like
most of the game, thoroughly solemn. The main NPC of the game, when
you encounter him toward the end, offers minimal interaction -- and it
seems that, considering his identity, something amusing could have
been coded in (I certainly never found anything). (No, the bugs
involving what happens when he follows you around don't count.)

Again, this is not to say that Zork III is humorless -- but the plot
feels deadly serious and there is little of the comic in any vital
element to the game. (Compare, for instance, the rainbow and bat
puzzles in <a href = "#zork1">Zork I</a>, or the lizard or Cerberus in <a href = "#zork2">Zork II</a>.) The reasons
for that are debatable, but my own feeling was that it was a product
of the structure of the game; more on that in a moment.

The writing reinforces the feel; most of the locations you visit are
either on barren landscape or in abandoned rooms evocative of the
decayed empire. Though the quality of writing is similar to that of
Zork II, the mood created is different: where Zork II's images
depicted a mysterious and slightly dangerous cave, with breathtaking
views juxtaposed with cramped caverns, Zork III gives us gloom and
emptiness. In a sense, though there are a few NPC interactions, no one
is there; you are wandering around a region where no one is or has
been for a while, and no one wants to be. For example:

        Land of Shadow

        You are standing atop a steep cliff, looking west over a vast
        ocean. Far below, the surf pounds at a sandy beach. To the
        south and east are rolling hills filled with eerie shadows. A
        path cut into the face of the cliff descends toward the
        beach. To the north is a tall stone wall, which ends at the
        cliff edge. It was obviously built long ago, and directly
        north is a spot where you could climb over the rubble of the
        decaying wall.

Or:

        Scenic Vista

        You are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole
        exit to the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled
        &quot;Scenic Vista,&quot; whose featureless surface is angled toward
        you. One might believe that the table was used to indicate
        points of interest in the view from this spot, like those
        found in many parks. On the other hand, your surroundings are
        far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could
        this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above the table
        reads &quot;IV&quot;.

        Mounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room
        with a flickering light.

It is hard to put a label on the mood of Zork III -- &quot;brooding,&quot;
perhaps, but that would make it more ominous than it is. If anything,
it seems like a T.S. Eliot scene, with its barren landscapes and wisps
of mist and enigmatic encounters with unidentified characters. (As I
spent last winter in Scotland -- on the North Sea coast, even -- the
Land of Shadow description above feels familiar indeed.) The adjective
&quot;gray&quot; never appears, as far as I can tell, in any of the room
descriptions in Zork III, and yet there is a grayness about the game
environment that makes the feel of the game far more real, more
coherent, than the other two, even if the scenes themselves are less
picturesque than those of Zork II. The description of the clifftop
captures the study in contrasts:

         Cliff

         This is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred
         feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface
         through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the
         world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains,
         have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in
         the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer
         precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks
         below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall,
         crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to
         the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to
         the east looks lifeless and barren.

A vivid scene, indeed -- a glimpse of the life above ground in full
awareness of the bleakness of the setting, and, implicitly, color
contrasting with drabness, the look up toward the hole in the cavern
balanced against the look down, over the cliff. There is much to
appreciate in the writer's ability to accent the pertinent visual
details.

The plot -- well, thereby hangs a tale. Though, as in the first two
entries, you discover what the plot is as you progress, you are given
a sense in the prologue of what you are looking for, and it quickly
becomes clear that no crystal tridents or golden statuettes are at
issue this time around. The scoring system -- you have seven major
tasks to perform and are given a point for each, though the game will
be far from over when the seven tasks are done -- reflects the new
approach. &quot;Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!&quot; proclaims the
figure of the prologue, and prowess is not established by a propensity
for gathering loot. It can be argued that the substitute makes little
more sense, but my own reaction was that I was on the trail of
something more interesting than another chunk of gold -- and Zork III
does try as well, though not very successfully, to put a different
face on the skillful adventurer. (Suffice it to say that your final
encounter gives a touch of Matthew 25:31-46 to the rest of the game.)

There is a tension here between the two sides of what you are
accomplishing over the course of the game, and my own feeling was that
it would have been a more interesting tension with more development of
the second, more subjective angle, the element not measured by items
acquired.  (As it is, there are still shades of the more
tried-and-true scavenger-hunt approach, though the objects sought are
different.) The outcomes in the museum and at the top of the cliff
particularly play up how the player's assumptions must change -- in a
sense, the central puzzles are those of a child presented with a
cookie jar. It is certainly worth pondering how the nature of your
escapade with the ring fits into the character-development angle --
and it seems like the sword-in-the-stone angle might have been
reworked to fit that idea better. To discuss the plot any more
specifically would give away too much of the game, but whatever the
failings of the storyline in Zork III, it does offer food for thought,
and brings the would-be looter, fresh from amassing two games' worth
of bounty, up short. (And the ultimate ending offers, in a sense, the
ultimate twist.)

The puzzles vary widely -- some are memorable, some are nothing
special, and some are just irritating -- and there aren't many. There
is one that there seems little possibility of guessing -- the player
hits on it by chance if at all. One required series of actions is
time-sensitive in a thoroughly nonobvious way; it is easy to lock
yourself out of victory simply by waiting too long to settle a certain
matter. The infamous Royal Puzzle is not the hardest puzzle in the
game; once the player grasps the mechanics, it is a matter of careful
planning more than anything else. But small slips can, again, lock one
out of completing it (and there is disappointingly little payoff to
solving it, other than survival).  Others -- the museum and viewing
room puzzles, in particular -- are rather rewarding, though, and the
latter even explains one of the odder red herrings from Zork II. And
the mirror box, while it takes considerable mental aerobics to picture
and use properly, is one of the more intriguing Infocom contraptions;
mastering its more complicated purpose without help is no small
feat. I found the last puzzle a bit unfair -- I learned later that a
clue to it appeared where no clue had been before, but, silly me, I
didn't think to check. But the novice should be warned that a few of
Zork III's puzzles are difficult indeed, and require some trial and
error -- considerable, actually -- to solve.

There are many small things to enjoy along the course of Zork III,
including the obligatory bits of self-reference; like Infocom or hate
it, it certainly did come up with novel ways to plug upcoming games,
and the advertisement for <a href = "e.html#enchant">Enchanter</a> in Zork III is no exception
(though it's something of a bitter taste). Some of the problems
involve Zork in-jokes of sorts, humor appreciable mainly for its
cumulative effects through the first two games -- at the ocean and
south of the lake, in particular, and upon examining the plaque in the
Jewel Room. And there are genuinely riveting moments, in particular
your last glimpse of the hooded figure from the Land of Shadow and
your encounter, successful or not, with the Guardians of Zork. A game
as skillfully written as Zork III need not describe every room
elaborately, simply because the more lengthy descriptions are more
than adequate to set the scene in the player's mind; I know I could
picture the hallway of the Guardians of Zork vividly, though the room
descriptions were fairly cursory. Though the gameplay is sometimes
clumsy -- at one point, &quot;enter the flaming pit&quot; elicits &quot;You hit your
head against the flaming pit as you attempt this feat&quot;, and &quot;climb
wall&quot; yields &quot;There's no tree here suitable for climbing&quot; -- the
parser is usually strong enough to smooth things over.

To appreciate Zork III, I think, the player needs to appreciate what
the game authors were setting out to do -- and it was not simply to
end the series, because a final spectacular treasure hunt would have
done that perfectly well. To have solved Zork III is to have looked
critically at some of the cliches of the fantasy genre, some obvious
-- the treasure element -- but some less so, such as the expectation
of spectacular or striking locations. By setting much of the game on
what could be an English moor or heath -- the Crystal Grotto is a
somewhat jarring exception -- or an American plain and mountainside,
the designers subvert those expectations and make your quest, if
anything, prosaic -- at least, prosaic relative to the expectations of
the genre. The many locations that are not significant for any puzzle
reinforce the same effect, as do details like &quot;The ground here is
quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's
edge.&quot; There are few mighty deeds in Zork III -- no dragon to slay or
gates of Hades to enter; instead, the puzzles involve cleverness or
survival, and using fairly conventional tools to achieve your
ends. Perhaps most interestingly, there is minimal magic in Zork III,
and you have minimal control over anything magical; logic and
mechanics are at issue in the puzzles.

Certainly, not everything about the game is fresh -- the overarching
plot is not, after all, especially original -- but the experience of
playing the game yields something unfamiliar to the fantasy
enthusiast. In a sense, the nature of the world of Zork III brings the
person sitting at the keyboard into the game in a way that the Zork II
player was not likely to feel, unless he or she was used to
encountering wizards and unicorns.

In the end, the success of Zork III depends on how open the player is to
the game's peculiarities. The game is less fun in the most obvious sense
than its two predecessors; it indulges in fewer amusing antics and has
fewer rewarding things to do. But it ties up the series in a way that more
of the same would not have; it marks the end of a process that had been
hinted at in Zork II, a process whereby the player's interests and
priorities change, and there is more impetus to see and understand than
simply to secure what is valuable and bolt. The ending provides a certain
perspective on the adventurer that was, particularly in light of the
ending of Zork Zero, and the endgame -- centered around prison cells -- is
appropriately down-to-earth for the feel of Zork III. There are many good
things about Zork III, in the end, and perhaps the best of them is that,
in most respects, it goes against the fantasy-game grain.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag2.html">SPAG #2</a> -- September 26, 1994

NAME: The Zork Trilogy                  PARSER: Early Infocom
AUTHOR: Infocom                         PLOT: Item Collection
ATMOSPHERE: Coherent and rich           AVAILABILITY: LTOI 1
WRITING: Solid                          PUZZLES: Varies, usually good

DIFFICULTY: Standard for all three (5 out of 10), but Zork III hardest
EMAIL: ???

Ah, the Zork Trilogy.  Basically chopped-up components of the Dungeon game
which was so popular at MIT, these were the games that launched Infocom to
its evenutal fame and fortune.  Based more or less on the concepts put
forth by the original <a href = "a.html#advent">Adventure</a> game, the Zork trilogy games are mostly an
exercise in collection of &quot;treasure&quot; items and solving more or less
unrelated puzzles.  <a href = "#zork1">Zork I</a> is a particularly good example of this, where
the player is apparently looting for looting's own sake, while <a href = "#zork2">Zork II</a> sets
the collection of treasures up as part of the plot (although you must
discover this for yourself; at first, you are merely collecting them
because you get points for having each one).  <a href = "#zork3">Zork III</a> changes from
collection of &quot;treasures&quot; to collection of related items which taken
together serve as a complete set of &quot;Dungeon Mastering&quot; equipment.  But in
all three of the games, the puzzles surrounding these items (while for the
most part well-written, logical, and fun to solve) are basically unrelated
to one another or to the story as a whole.  The disparate elements are
loosely glued together by the concept of the &quot;Great Underground Empire&quot; 
wherein all three games are set, but beyond that there is no real
connection (and thus the games become rather non-linear in places, which is
a good thing in this reviewer's opinion, but for the wrong reasons!)

In Zork I, you play an adventurer who seemingly stumbles upon the ruins of
the Great Underground Empire in the basement of an abandoned white house. 
You immediately set about gathering the Twenty Treasures of Zork, and put
them in your trophy case for safekeeping.  Along the way, you'll deal with
a nasty troll, a particularly nasty thief, and a maze (blech).

Zork II casts you as this same adventurer, continuing his explorations into
the GUE (as detailed at the end of Zork I).  This time, however, you find
yourself in the realm of the crafty and capricious Wizard of Frobozz, whose
magic seldom works exactly as he intends it to but always causes you a
hassle or two.  Freeing yourself from his domain and taking his power for
your own is the goal of this one, though it's really just another &quot;collect
the treasures&quot; exercise with the worst puzzle in Infocom history thrown in
for good measure (the baseball diamond one, for those who know).

Zork III ends the tale of your exploits, as you find yourself confronted by
the mysterious being known as the Dungeon Master.  This game is the worst
of the lot, and should be played more for the sake of completeness than
anything else.  The ending will be apparent long before you get there, and
it's not particuarly fun getting there either because of some very stupid
random elements to the puzzles which require proper timing (but give no
warning to the player that this is the case).  This game experiments with a
strange scoring system unlike any other Infocom game -- 7 points, one for
each of the &quot;major&quot; actions you must complete (which does not include
actually winning, I might add).  Much shorter than the other two, this game
seems more like an afterthought than a conclusion.

At any rate, in comparison with Infocom's later works, the Zork Trilogy are
on a much lower level.  However, they are enjoyable games each in their own
right, (though Zork III stretches it right to the limit!) and should be
played by any fan of interactive fiction.  Don't expect detailed plot,
however; it simply isn't there.  These games, however, form an important
part of the base upon which today's IF is built, and therefore are entitled
to a bit of easy treatment.  As the first truly &quot;commercial&quot;  IF played by
any significant number of people, the Zork games are a major milestone in
the history of IF -- and they are fun, taken at face value.  If you can get
them in the original packaging, do so -- the GUE materials are worth the
price of admission alone.  If not, however, they are part of the Lost
Treasures of Infocom pacakge.  Highly recommended for play by everyone who
wants to know where IF in general and Infocom in particular got going.

NAME: Zork: A Troll's Eye View (An Interactive Tedium)
AUTHOR: Dylan O'Donnell
EMAIL: dylanw SP@G demon.net
DATE: January 1997
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Inform ports
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/inform/troll.z5">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/inform/troll.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 2

I must say I had my doubts about this game during the first few turns.
The player character is a workaday troll toiling in the underground
world of <a href = "#zorktril">Zork</a>, unable to leave his post and with only his bloody axe for
company. I worried that perhaps the tedium aspect was the only comment
Dylan wished to make about a troll's work. When the first adventurer
appeared in the room but then retreated, I really thought there might
not be anything more to the game. Then out of nowhere, another
adventurer appeared and unsportingly killed me! I had to have revenge! I
stuck around for the next 100 turns until I killed and was killed at
least a dozen times. Sated, I quit.

If I had stuck to my post for a couple dozen more turns, my shift would
have ended, reported Dylan. I played the game again and was gratified to
receive my paycheck. The game rewards you with extra commands to use in
a replay, including how to cut down on the tedium and maximize the
combat.

This game is a good example of how an author can set clear limits for a
small game and satisfy the player within those boundaries. Just about
every possible action is rewarded with a response in this one-location
game.  Several classic Zork commands are supported. Responses vary
depending on whether you are on guard or in combat. While the combat
text is not original (it is taken from the Dungeon source), it
highlights the spurting blood aspects of Zork's sword and axe play.

Shameful confession: I wrote to Dylan praising his text in the combat
scenes and received his reply that the text was not his own. I have
never gotten very far playing Zork or its progenitors. Dylan explained
the retreating adventurer I had first encountered: &quot;The adventurers that
don't stop are the ones that didn't get the sword from the Living Room,
spot a big nasty monster and think, 'Oops. Maybe I'd better try a
different route'; they're back as soon as they find the chimney up and
come back round with the sword.&quot; I was the kind of adventurer who fooled
around a bit, got bored, and quit before ever meeting a troll in
battle.  Maybe it's time to go back and try again.

Zork: A Troll's Eye View is billed as a coding exercise by its author,
but I think it serves another useful purpose. Give it to your friends
who might like IF, but who might also find the full-scale Zork daunting.
Whet their appetites with this game, and you may have a new convert to
interactive fiction.

OVERALL: 6.5

Short but entertaining, Zork: The Undiscovered Underground is the
first Zork text adventure to be produced under the auspices of Infocom
since 1987's <a href = "#zork0">Zork Zero</a>. Changes in the entertainment world since then
mean that the text game that couldn't exist as a marketable product in
its own right (or so believes Activision) was produced for the sake of
the graphic game Zork: Grand Inquisitor, as a teaser/prequel. While I
can't comment on the worth of ZGI, I do think there's more than enough
in ZTUU to make it an enjoyable game, with or without the larger game,
and the whole thing feels appropriately Zorklike.

That it should, as it happens, because the writing comes courtesy of
original Implementors Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, while our own (the
IF community's, that is) G. Kevin Wilson did the programming, in
Inform. The mechanics of the collaboration aren't clear--to me,
anyway--but it's skillfully done: there are very few slips that I can
see 'twixt writing and programming (a room description beginning &quot;As
you step through the door...&quot;, for example). The game is awash in
references to Zorks of old--there are 69,105 seats in a theater, you
carry an &quot;ersatz-Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever&quot;--and there
are several responses that mimic the original trilogy (notably, ZORK
still yields &quot;At your service&quot;), though I missed the variety of snappy
retorts to JUMP. (YELL, unaccountably, yielded nothing at all. I
thought that was in one of the Inform libraries.) At any rate, ZTUU
also reproduces the atmosphere of the earlier games: the setting is an
abandoned &quot;cultural complex&quot; with plenty of details about the Flathead
influence (there is a backstage scrim for Uncle Flathead's Cabin), and
plenty of funny self-reference. The game is set after the fall of the
Empire and the end of the Age of Magic (the Age of Science is now
underway)--the year is 1066--and the sense of rediscovering the
crumbling underground world is just as strong as in the originals: the
game strives more for <a href = "#zork2">Zork II</a>-style silliness than <a href = "#zork3">Zork III</a>-style
desolation, but there is some of both, for example in the &quot;fifty-story
triumphal arch&quot; leading into the ruined theater.

The puzzles are few and not particularly hard, with the exception of
one toward the end that requires some intuition (though there's an odd
parallel with one of this past year's competition entries.) The main
problem is that the whole thing is a little directionless--your
initial instruction is to &quot;explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back
news,&quot; though the objective soon becomes getting out. But you don't
plan your escape so much as solve a series of puzzles, the last of
which happens to give you a rather unlikely escape route (clued, but
not in a way that most would guess). This isn't a huge setback--after
all, it's consistent with the &quot;go-wander-around&quot; feel of Zorks I and
II--but given that the game never really goes anywhere, plot-wise,
it's a little odd to consider this a &quot;teaser.&quot; It certainly didn't
tease me into buying ZGI (though that was probably inevitable, since
it would require that I buy a new computer as well), nor could it,
really, since there are no cliffhangers, nothing intriguing that won't
be resolved until the later game. (I was expecting ZTUU to leave me in
some perilous place, or afford me a glimpse of something tantalizing.)

The most interesting element of ZTUU, to my mind, was what it
indicated about Activision's view on the continuing IF community. The
amount and variety of references to the older text games--and the
simple fact that it was produced in Inform by a member of that
community--suggested to me that any promotional effect this might have
for the graphic-adventure crowd was incidental: the point was to hype
ZGI to the die-hard text fans (though, again, I'm afraid it didn't do
that well). After all, those most comfortable with point-and-click
wouldn't be likely to catch on to the parser quickly enough to make
the game worthwhile. (Reinforcing that, when the Implementors make
their obligatory appearance: one of them recalls the &quot;virtues of ZIL,
but offers the opinion that a faster compiler would have been nice.&quot;
Cute, and obviously directed to the latter-day programming
crowd. Blank and Berlyn have their fun with the project: the room
where you find the busts of the Implementors goes on at some length
about the &quot;Golden Age of Text Adventures,&quot; and then notes that &quot;it is
clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now,
above the busts, is a sign reading, 'Consult the Oracles - 10
Zorkmids.'&quot;)

It is worth wondering, though: if the attention of the latter-day
text-IF community is important enough for Activision to produce
freeware as promotion, even short freeware, might the company secure
the services of Blank and Berlyn for a full-length commercial text
game again? (I know I'd buy it.) Alas, probably not, for a few
reasons. For one thing, piracy would be too easy--data files for text
games are small enough to transfer here and there quickly, and copy
protection in the old Infocom style could be easily duplicated. (As
far as I can tell, the existing community has been reasonably honest
about not giving away copy-protection secrets even for the
Masterpieces games, but that's not exactly something that Activision
can bank on.) More importantly, it's not clear that the market is big
enough to make such a project worthwhile--spending some extra money on
a game likely to make plenty from the graphics crowd is one thing,
relying on text-gamers to make a game profitable on their own is
another. Finally, the sheer size of the free- and shareware IF market
would probably discourage anyone from trying to market a new
commercial game, since text fans don't really need any one new game
for a fix (and those who have exhausted the resources of the GMD
archive are probably few). It'd be nice if there were a way to
convince Activision that enough of us would buy a new text Zork entry
to make it profitable, but I'm afraid it probably ain't so. (And
yet...if there were another freeware teaser that actually worked as a
teaser, except leading to a larger _text_ game...well, one wonders.)

At any rate, though there isn't a lot there, ZTUU is a charming return
to the Zork universe in text form: those who appreciated the humor
then are sure to enjoy it even more now. With more to do and more of a
plot, further text offerings from Activision might even be
commercially viable.

VERSION: Release 2

If you don't know what the term 'zugzwang' means, I don't want to spoil
your fun of playing the game. But if you're one of those several
geniuses who play chess sometimes, you already know what it means. Yes,
this game is about chess. I'll tell you more -- this game is a sort of
chess simulation. You yourself are a chess piece -- imagine this. But
this is not so bad as it sounds -- in the beginning you're only a Pawn
(the least powerful piece in chess). And if you're smart and bold (you
must be very bold or, umm, very bald -- I'm not sure) you will really
win. Your moves can bring peace and order on the chess fields.
Incredible responsibility lies on your weak (in the beginning) shoulders
-- it is up to you to save the entire world. 'Zugzwang' features many
never-before-seen aspects of RPG (role-playing games) and RTS (real-time
strategy). There are about ten big battle fields, and hundreds of types
of armor and weapons. The deepest depth of NPC implementation that the
IF world has ever seen would be enough already to earn Zugzwang the
honor of most intellectual game in GMD. But it must not distract you
from the game: 'Zugzwang' features a floating level of difficulty; that
is, the game observes your playing skill and if you're good, the
difficulty rises and vice versa. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) never
lets you stay bored.

There are some bad things about game itself: if you own a quite small
computer screen you can't enjoy the beautiful almost-3D graphics. But if
you have a good fast 3D accelerator (like Voodoo 5 or GeForce 256 -- I
have both) and a really fast computer you'll experience the full quality
of this technically high-end game. But if you want more, a good
expensive sound system will help, as well your favorite joystick. This
game compelled me to buy a professional sound card, and I don't think
that my money was lost. And there is this unique feature: 'Zugzwang'
supports VR-helmets of six types. But most important, this game is
compatible with almost every computer system (Windows 2000, Linux, Mac
etc., etc.).

You must know that this particular game is only a demo. To receive the
full story of 'The Interactive Life of a Chess Piece' you must register.
And I can say that it is worth your money. The full version comes on
_two_ DVDs or on _twelve_ CDs. "But what is the special offer mentioned
in the demo game?" you can ask. It is source code for the _entire_ game,
which means that you yourself can create a game that you can sell after
that. Yes, sell -- and get really big money for several hours work. This
game is really good from the standpoint of creating your own version.
And, of course, even the demo version supports multiplayer mode via the
Internet.

This game is the apotheosis of the text adventure. You _must_ play at
least a demo. But I'm sure that after the very beautiful, stunning, mind
bending climax, for the next several hours you'll only be able to do one
thing: reminisce over the greatest moments of the game. And after that
you'll smash your piggy bank and order the full registered version of
'Zugzwang'.

One last thing that I absolutely must say -- this game is fully
compatible with RAIF-POOL. And if you're not a beginner in IF, that will
definitely mean something to you.

Zuni Doll bills itself as an &quot;interactive horror story,&quot; and its setup
faithfully recalls horror movies: you, the unsuspecting schlump, have
bought a doll associated with a strange legend involving homicidal
tendencies held at bay by magic, and the setup ends with an indication
that the magic has been disabled. What follows is predictable but
entertaining, to a point: you are attacked by the bloodthirsty
foot-high doll and devise various clever means of saving your skin. If
you haven't seen &quot;Child's Play,&quot; no need to rent it: Zuni Doll has
roughly the same idea.

Zuni Doll benefits, to some extent, from appearing at a time when
horror movies are in scant supply (well, they're still in video
stores, but they don't get released much)--and to the extent they
appear, they have to make fun of the genre, as in Scream. (Admittedly,
this isn't a horror buff writing, but I'm gonna generalize anyway.) If
it were the mid-'80s, Zuni Doll wouldn't feel remarkable, since the
player could get the same idea far more vividly on screen--but in
1998, there's a nostalgia to playing a game that tries to reproduce
that feel. And Zuni Doll is successful to some measure: the setup is
appropriately ominous, the contrived circumstances that loose the doll
on you just plausible enough to feel real, and several of the
confrontations (particularly when the doll is hacking its way through
a door) genuinely suspenseful even if improbable.

Unfortunately, implementation problems weigh the game down
considerably. A certain device that you throw together to thwart the
doll defies both logic and reasonable syntax--I was forced to resort
to the walkthrough.  (Actions that aren't on the author's mind get
&quot;This dangerous act would achieve little,&quot; as if danger were a primary
consideration with a homicidal doll on the loose.) At several points,
hitting the doll elicits &quot;That would be less than courteous,&quot;
hilarious enough (Graham probably didn't have this sort of thing in
mind when he wrote Inform's default responses) but not helpful for the
overall feel of the game, shall we say.  And after a certain point in
the game, the suspense more or less disappears, and you can take as
long as you like to dispose of the doll.  That, unfortunately,
subverts the desperate feel of the earlier scenes--you're out of
danger, and you needn't make every move count--and thereby loses the
aura of the horror movie. Grammar problems and some improbable
coincidences don't help. And, if I may say so, the author humanizes
the doll just a bit too much, in that it seems to acknowledge pain and
takes time to lick its wounds, so to speak--wouldn't a villain intent
only on killing be a little more scary (&quot;it's STILL COMING!&quot;)?

There are, to be sure, many things that Zuni Doll does well, and the
author seems to be familiar enough with the conventions of horror that
another attempt might be quite successful. Notably, the MacGyver-esque
feel of turning ordinary household objects into weapons or shields is
well rendered and often very funny, and the ultimate resolution is
satisfying.  The game builds tension well, in the prologue and when
the doll is hacking through the door, though the game might have
benefited by even more of it (after all, the scariest bits in movies
of this ilk are always when the bad guy is lurking somewhere, not when
he's on screen)--perhaps an extended buildup, with ominous noises and
such? Also, there are some fairly clever puzzles, though making time
to figure them out slows the game down--my feeling is that the author
should either keep the puzzles or the horror-movie feel, but not try
to do both.

This is a nice effort that needs some work, in short. If it breaks new
ground in IF--I can't think of any slasher games as such--it should be
noted as such; perhaps it might lead to more polished efforts. As it
stands, it recaptures the feel of horror movies only in fits and
starts.
