VERSION: Version 1.0

After playing Magnus Olsson's acclaimed entry in last year's
competition, <a href = "u.html#uncle">Uncle Zebulon's Will</a>, I was expecting a lot from this -
particularly when I saw that it was set in the same universe.
Unfortunately, this is an experiment in utilising senses other than
sight rather than a full game, and it shows - the plot is a standard
&quot;quest for the magic mcguffin,&quot; and feels tacked on.

The atmosphere created by spending most of the adventure in the dark
is moderately effective, but the use of other senses is too limited to
do the situation justice.

As a game, there is not a lot for the player to do.  I completed it in
under an hour, most of the time spent wandering around because I
hadn't spotted what I was supposed to be doing.  There is a good
selection of alternate endings, but all in all it felt too small and
shallow to satisfy.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag10.html">SPAG #10</a> -- February 4, 1997

Ah, Magnus Olsson is sneaky, using an attention-getting device similar
yet opposite to the one used by the (dull) AGT game &quot;<A HREF="z.html#zanfar">Zanfar</A>.&quot;
&quot;Zanfar&quot; has a name that places it last in an alphabetic directory
listing, so that it's the last title a player sees, thus making it
remain fresh in his/her mind.  Magnus' tactic is the opposite.  He
gives his game a name that places it FIRST, in the hopes of grabbing
the advantage from players who go through all the entries in
alphabetical order, thus leaving no prior work for players to compare
his entry to.  Well, it didn't work on me!  I saw through your little
plot, Magnus, and I made it a point to play &quot;Aayela&quot; DEAD LAST, so
that I could effectively compare it to EVERYTHING!!  AH HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

*Ahem.*  Well.

&quot;Aayela&quot; is set in the land of Vyhl, visited by your character at the
end of Magnus' 1995 entry <a href = "u.html#uncle">Uncle Zebulon's Will</a>. That said, I guess
I expected a more obvious continuation of &quot;Zebulon,&quot; in the shoes of
the same character, uncovering more of the same mystical land while
perhaps getting a chance to meet my eccentric uncle Zeb.  Instead I
found myself assuming the role of another young (expendable) unknown
set off to seek out the standard adventure-game McGuffin, in this case
the Stone of Aayela.

As in &quot;Zebulon,&quot; Magnus' writing shines.  (Does so, Gareth!)  Like the
vanished Zebulon with whom a rapport was forged in &quot;Aayela&quot;'s prequel,
the imprisoned spirit of Aayela guides the player forward and develops
into a part of him.  This is paced nicely, with the unique setting of
total darkness for much of the quest.

Unfortunately, this mars the realism created by the rest of the
writing.  The room text is sometimes no more than standard cave
descriptions preceded by the words &quot;It's completely dark.&quot;  The
protagonist's sense of direction must be uncanny to allow him to
navigate with no light by which to see his compass.  There's no threat
of danger, either, until the very end, after which I was left with a
feeling of, &quot;You mean that's IT?!&quot;

I liked &quot;Aayela,&quot; don't get me wrong.  I simply didn't find it as
clever as Magnus' previous work, particularly when compared with so
many other outstanding entries this year.

VERSION: 1.0

You are a 14th century scholar sent, by no less a personage than the
Pope himself, to recover ten treasures after a fire at the Abbey of
Montglane. This old-time DOS adventures deserves a SPAG review for its
attempts to bring the medieval thriller genre to IF, and for its good
puzzles, plot, and imagery. This imagery is achieved despite
descriptions which are not surprisingly economic considering that parser
and world are condensed into a 51K executable. There&#8217;s a sense of
incredulity at certain points as the plot develops, but the denouement
is satisfying, providing revelation and resolution of what has gone
before. Some pieces recur from LaFrana&#8217;s earlier and rougher "Hampton
Manor", but these are merely in-jokes, and not distracting. 

Your score proceeds through a series of ranks, which also neatly split
the game into seven sections, which although set in the same environment
involve different puzzles of increasing complexity. One logical but
complex puzzle (perhaps the most complex) eventually results in apparent
bloodshed when you dispatch the only NPC of any significance, but since
the first time you encounter him he&#8217;s likely to kill you, it might
reasonably be considered self-defence.

The parser is claimed to be better than that in "Hampton Manor", and is
certainly adequate, but there are still verb problems. As in the
previous game, "move" is more effective than "search", contrary to
widespread IF convention, and one puzzle early in the game is
effectively impossible for non-US English speakers. I do not consider
revealing unintentional difficulties to be spoilers, and as this is not
the only game with this problem it is worth mentioning. The verb in
question is "pry" which as far as I know isn&#8217;t used in the intended
sense outside North America. So here is an appeal to library designers
to include "pry" as a standard verb synonymous with "prise", "jemmy",
"prize", "jimmy", "jimmi", "lever" and "force".

The game&#8217;s later stages are genuinely demanding, including one puzzle
involving not just a bit of arithmetic but also close observation of
scenery. One problem with this is that by the time you get to this stage
you may well have forgotten a clue. Worth trying, and, if the author is
still collecting it, also worth the registration fee.

PARSER: TADS standard

VERSION: 1.2

Michael says that this game is the first he has written with TADS, but
he doesn't make it clear whether it is his first IF game ever, or not.
If it is, it is extremely good for a first game; and even if it is not,
it's not a bad little game by any means.

You play Alex, a programmer newly hired for a software company whose
name is never revealed. As you pull into the parking lot for your first
day, you realise you've left your ID card at home. Just in case you
think the company will be understanding, as you approach the main doors,
you witness a man named Bill being fired for losing his ID. And so your
first problem is neatly set: how to get inside.

As you snoop around outside the building trying to work this out, you
overhear a conversation between two FBI agents who are investigating a
series of abductions among the employees of the company. Once inside the
building, investigating these disappearances forms the main plot of the
game.

This is not a <a href = "d.html#deadline">Deadline</a>-style detective game, though; while there are one
or two clues to find or conversations to overhear, most of the problems
are of the traditional kind: obtaining objects, getting through locked
doors, and all the other activities we IF-ers love so much.

These puzzles aren't very many - it's a relatively short game - but most
of them are very well polished. As it should be, it is often easy to see
what you are supposed to do, but difficult to see how you should do it.
They are all perfectly logical and very satisfying to solve, with one
exception. (The exception is how to open the prison cell door. I had to
resort to the walkthrough for that, and even now, I'm not sure how it
was supposed to work.)

One problem - how to get past Greg and Ed the guards - reminded me very
much of the Babel fish problem in <a href = "h.html#hitch">Hitchhiker's</a> (and, despite some
people's opinions, that is a good thing). You find the first part of the
solution, and a second obstacle is revealed. Beat that, and a third is
found; and so on, until you get all parts in place and watch it unfold
like clockwork. Great fun.

Throughout the game, Michael shows a good instinct for how much of a
clue to give the player when you get the answer to a problem `almost
right'. If you are wearing an incomplete disguise, for example, you will
be told which part you are missing - but not where or how to get it, of
course.

There is also a very sparse HINT function. It hardly ever gives the
complete solution to a problem; most of the time it simply tells you
which problem you should be tackling next, sometimes it gives the broad
outline of the solution.

This is also the first game I have played with a WINNABLE command, which
shows whether or not the game has been put into an unwinnable state.
This is, in my opinion, a great thing, and I'm glad to hear it's
becoming quite common.

I should mention that the game is extremely linear. There is never a
choice as to which problem to solve next - even on occasions when it
would have been easy to do so. There is always something that means you
can't get into a necessary area until you've solved the previous
problem. This didn't bother me too much, as it fit into the general
spirit of the game. You'll know whether it will bother you or not.

My main complaint is that the descriptions are so dull. Except for a few
pieces of humour (which stick out like sore thumbs), we are told the
absolute bare minimum about each room or object. Here are a few samples:

   Front of Building
      You're standing in front of the building of your new company. It's
   a two story building that is shaped like an inverted V. The entrance
   is marked by two large glass doors. To the east is the parking lot.
   Paths also lead north and south.

   Parking Lot
      You're in the middle of a fairly large parking lot, standing
   beside your car.  To the west is the front of the building.

   Copy Room
      You've made your way into a small room used to store day-to-day
   office equipment.  Various pieces of equipment line the wall.

   >X SHREDDER
   The shredder is sitting on a small table at the far end of the room.
   It is currently turned on.

   >X PEN
   It's an ordinary pen.
 
And so forth. There's nothing wrong with a few descriptions like this -
after all, <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>'s "South of House" was hardly the most interesting
location ever. But I could have chosen any room or object in this game
at all; I honestly can't think of a single exception. Each one is a
basic description, then a list of the things you need to know to solve
the game. Taken all together, it makes the world seem very, well, grey.

This is particularly true once you get inside your office. According to
the comments in the credits, the game had a maze at some point in its
history which was later taken out. I'm willing to bet that the maze was
the office, which consists of about 30 cubicles and offices, and the
hallways between. Michael has straightened it out, making it much easier
to navigate, but has kept the hallways' and cubicles' descriptions
identical except for the name of the occupant.

Michael claims the game is based very closely around the office where he
actually works. If this is true, he must be one of the most bored people
on Earth. Not only are the rooms so monotone, but his colleagues are all
clones. Meet one of them for the first time, and he or she will rise,
read your name tag, shake hands, and introduce themselves. Examine them,
and you will either see:
He's your average looking male. 
or: 
She's your average looking female.
They spend their day alternating between `trying to get some work done',
and talking on the phone. They refuse to talk about each other. It would
have been wonderful if the kidnappings turned out to be some sinister
force replacing people with these soulless androids, but sadly this
turns out not to be the case.

This especially hits you because you are set tasks where the only point
seems to be `See if you can find your way from here to this cubicle' -
another remnant of the maze, I imagine. Mazes are dull, but at least
there would have been a bit of challenge. As it is, these treks are
simply tedious.

I think I've concentrated too much on the bad points of this game -
mainly because the good points are the puzzles, and I can't describe
them too much without giving things away. Don't come to this game for
good writing, characterisation, or a good story - the plot is quite
simplistic. Do come for some very well designed puzzles, and a
satisfying little game that will keep you occupied for two or three
days.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag24.html">SPAG #24</a> -- March 24, 2001

Intrigued by the sole 8.7 score given to this game and a request for
reviews, I downloaded the TADS file and started playing. This was
immediately after finishing <a href = "l.html#little">"Little Blue Men"</a>, to which this new game
has some similarities, such as being set in a dull and frustrating
office. However, whereas <a href = "l.html#little">"Little Blue Men"</a> was tightly constructed, this
new game seems to sprawl a little, and consequently you find yourself
wandering through many locations that are essentially the same; it&#8217;s
good to keep a map because many have the same brief description.

The premise seems straightforward. You are Alex (a nicely genderless
name, but why are all the managers men?), a programmer starting the
first day of work at a new company. The first problem of the game is
that you have no ID card to gain entry to the building. The first
problem *with* the game is that that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem: for
example, why can&#8217;t you simply talk to the receptionist? This kind of
contrivance sticks out a little, and the game continues in this manner
for a while, with linear but frequently unlikely puzzle solutions. Of
course, all adventures have necessary objects just lying around to some
degree, but in Above and Beyond! this arbitrariness is quite
conspicuous. I also had to resort to using HINT occasionally to
double-check I was doing the right thing. (Despite what the author says
about being sparse, these HINTS are about right, subject to the two
criticisms here. The game also provides a useful WINNABLE command to
check the current position is worthy of saving and that you haven&#8217;t left
any important items behind.)

The story develops mostly by eavesdropping, which lends the game an
atmosphere reminiscent of a David Mamet thriller, as well as giving a
good opportunity for humour. You can also tell some of the author&#8217;s
interests by references to Page and Plant plus a few IT-based jokes. The
plot can be neatly divided into three. The introductory section concerns
getting access to the building, and is fairly obvious; I was lucky to
find a slightly concealed object first time off, and only had slight
problems with wanting to use "drop" instead of "put". The second section
involved a light satire of office work, and seemed reasonably intuitive
until some shenanigans with "Bob", where the player has to do a lot of
waiting and it doesn&#8217;t seem the puzzle solution is going to get you
anywhere. Ideally in IF, I would say that the complexity of the problem
should be proportionate to the importance the player is likely to give
it. At this one point, I admit to looking up someone&#8217;s else solution,
but after that it was plain sailing. The final section begins with a
nice puzzle which involves dying several times to deduce the complete
solution, and then again seemed to me to go off at a tangent, with the
solution just out of reach because one useful object has a second, more
obscure role. From then on, the game decides you don&#8217;t need any more
hints, and a rapid climax was for me let down by a final confrontation
with the villain of the piece which lacked credibility.

The game makes up for the formulaic and functional plot in the
non-player characters, of whom there are around 30. The office workers
are, the author claims, based on real people, but seem to be cut from
the same cloth (or class), with superficial details differing in the way
the author satirise their frequently bovine mannerisms. My favourite
among these is Brian the Guardian of the Library: "Brian is having an
in-depth conversation on the pro's and con's of formulating a policy of
systematically assigning street names to all city streets using the GPS
as a guide. This could, and probably will, take a while." The NPCs&#8217;
activities may noticeably depend on quite unrelated actions by you, but
this does not seriously detract from the game.

The writing is literate, but <a href = "v.html#varicella">Varicella</a> it is not, unfortunately.
"Walking the plank" makes you "giggle to yourself thinking you're on a
pirate ship" which I only criticise of because it&#8217;s the kind of thing I
might write. I only found one or two typos ("compliment" where it should
be "complement") or minor programming errors.

In conclusion, the good puzzles and characters are let down slightly by
the plot, and while not worthy of the high score previously given, is a
commendable first effort.

ACID WHIPLASH by Anonymous (a.k.a. RYBREAD CELSIUS CAN'T FIND A DICTIONARY
by Rybread Celsius and Cody Sandifer)

   &quot;This is terribly, terribly unfair. I'm really sorry. But I just
   started laughing hysterically, and it's not what the author intended.
   In the middle of an intense ending sequence, I read the line:

   'My blood pumper is wronged!'

   I just lost it. It's a very 'Eye of Argon' sort of line.&quot;
                        -- Andrew Plotkin, reviewing &quot;Symetry&quot;, 1/1/98

   &quot;It takes guts to do *anything* wearing a silver jumpsuit.
        My point:
   I bet Rybread wears *two* silver jumpsuits while he writes IF.&quot;
                                -- Brad O'Donnell, 1/6/98

I hope my title line isn't too big a spoiler. I guess I can't feel too
guilty about giving away something that's revealed in the first 3
seconds of the game. Anyway, it would be impossible to talk about this
game without talking about Rybread Celsius. Yes, Rybread Celsius. The
man, the myth, the legend. There are those who have called him &quot;A BONA
FIDE CERTIFIED GENIUS&quot; [1]. There are those who have called him &quot;the
worst writer in interactive fiction today&quot; [2]. There are even those
who have called him &quot;an adaptive-learning AI&quot; [3]. Whatever the truth
behind the smokescreen, opinion is clearly divided on the Celsius
oeuvre. He appears to have an enthusiastic cult following who look at
his works and see the stamp of genius, paralleled by another group who
look at those selfsame works and see only barely coherent English and
buggy code. I have always counted myself among the latter. Works like
Symetry and <a href = "p.html#liquid">Punkirita Quest</a> set my English-major teeth on edge. I have
never met a Rybread game that I've liked, or even halfway
understood. But Acid Whiplash is different.

First of all, I need to say that I'm going to call it Acid Whiplash, for
several reasons:

  1. I'm not sure what the game's real name is supposed to be.
  2. The other name, while it may be (is!) perfectly true, is just too long
     to write out.
  3. Acid Whiplash is just such a *perfect* name for this game.

I've never dropped acid myself, but I'm guessing that this game is
about the closest text game equivalent I will ever play, at least
until my next Rybread game. The world spins crazily about, featuring
(among other settings) a room shaped like a burning credit card (???),
nightmarish recastings of <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses</a> and <a href = "j.html#jigsaw">Jigsaw</a>, and your own
transformation into a car dashboard. Scene changes happen with
absolutely no warning, and any sense of emerging narrative is dashed
and jolted about, hard enough and abruptly enough to, well, to give
you a severe case of mental whiplash. Sounds like a typical Celsius
game so far, right? But here's the best part: stumbling through these
hallucinogenic sequences leads you through a multi-part interview
between Cody Sandifer and Celsius himself, an interview which had me
laughing out loud over and over. Sandifer is hilarious, striking the
pose of the intensely sincere reviewer, taking each deranged Celsius
word as gospel, and in the process manages actually to illuminate some
of the interesting corners of his subject, and subject matter. And
Rybread is...  Rybread, no more or less than ever. Perhaps being
changed into a dashboard while listening makes the whole thing funnier
-- I'm not sure.

As usual, my regular categories don't apply. Plot, puzzles, writing --
forget about it. Acid Whiplash has no real interaction or story in any
meaningful sense. (There is, however, one very funny scene where we
learn that Rybread is in fact the evil twin of a well-known IF
author). If you're looking for a plot, or even something vaguely
coherent, you ought to know that you're looking in the wrong
place. But if you aren't familiar with the Way of the Rybread, or even
if you are, I recommend giving Acid Whiplash a look. It might shed
some light on what all these crazy people are talking about... but
don't expect to understand the *next* Celsius game.

You start Acorn Court in the courtyard of the title, with no idea what
you're trying to achieve. This early location shows the effort that's
been made to imbue the setting with a distinct atmosphere. A bit
overdone, in my opinion, but I was pleased the effort had been made
and was looking forward to exploring this world. However, 'twas not to
be. There's a reason why you have no idea what's going on - nothing
is. This is a one-location game, containing one relatively
straightforward puzzle, and no plot. I can't really give examples of
the text or sub-puzzles without revealing a fair proportion of the
game. I don't know if this was written as a get-to-grips-with-Inform
exercise? If so it's fine. The one quite complex object is quite well
programmed, and while there's the odd quirk (You are carrying: twelve
tennis balls, six tennis balls and) and the odd misleading response
when you don't quite get the author's preferred wording, there are no
major problems.

Have a look if you fancy a five or ten minute puzzle, or better still,
see if there's larger game by the same author.

NAME: Ad Verbum
AUTHOR: Nick Montfort
EMAIL: nickm SP@G nickm.com
DATE: October 2000
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-Machine interpreters
AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/adverbum.z5">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/adverbum.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 1 / Serial number 000925

One line summary: Nord and Bert with attitude.

This isn't Nick's second game, but it is the second game of his that is
fairly widely known. The first one was <a href = "w.html#winchester">"Winchester's Nightmare"</a> which
took an interesting tack in trying to get the player to be really part
of the story. Instead of the usual ">" prompt, the player is presented
with "Sarah decides to", and you get to fill in what you would like her
to decide to do.

This really made you feel part of the action, but it had the drawback of
eliminating the standard commands we came to know and love over the past
20+ years of IF. Notably, 'i' for inventory, 'n' for north, and so on.
"Sarah decides to sw" doesn't make much sense as a sentence.

"Ad Verbum" takes this into account in a thoroughly amusing and clever
way. If you use commands like 'up' and 'north', the room descriptions
will also use them. If you instead use 'u' and 'n', so do the room
descriptions. Some people might find this off-putting. I found it
grin-worthy.

But enough of that. The game itself presents the player with a seemingly
simple stint: acquire all objects from a house and dump them in the
Dumpster. The catch is that the house once belonged to the "cantankerous
Wizard of Wordplay", so it's not as simple as going through each room
and picking up the objects. You have to obey the rules.

For example, in one room, you can only use words that begin with the
letter 's', however the only way to leave it is to the north, which is a
word you can't use. You also have to be able to pick up objects in those
rooms, again only using 's'-words.

Naturally, when you're in an 'n'-, 'e'- or 'w'-only room, it's hard to
save the game, so Nick has you read a warning message before entering
those rooms explaining the situation. It's a bit on the defensive side
and it definitely breaks the flow of the game, but I'm sure that
beginning players would find it useful. I, on the other hand, would have
preferred to see that as a puzzle one discovered during the course of
play.

After all, the game is short enough. Too short, really, because these
are the kinds of puzzles I love to see. Reading the text, thinking up
possible solutions, a bright flash of discovery, the eagerness to see
what's next... that's what IF is all about.

The only downside to the game is that it didn't recognize quite as many
words as I thought it ought to. It's frustrating to think of a perfectly
good word ('scarper' to leave the 's' room, for instance) and then have
it not work. I'm sure Nick will be getting plenty of suggestions from
others, if he hasn't already.

That being said, this was the game that made the whole competition for
me. I enjoyed it from intro to quit. Nick, if you're reading this, keep
writing more! I'd love to play a full-size game with this sort of wacky
wordplay and perplexing puzzles.

Infocom, in its heyday, produced some games the likes of which has never
been seen since, either because there's no perceived interest in such
games (the mysteries in particular) or because amateur IF writers don't
have access to the proper technology (the more graphical games). Neither
of those objections necessarily applies to <a href = "n.html#nord">Nord and Bert Couldn't Make
Head or Tail of It</a>, a wordplay game, but Nick Montfort's Ad Verbum is
arguably the first free- or shareware IF game to follow in Nord and
Bert's footsteps. (Dennis Cunningham's T-Zero had some points in common,
but there was more going on than wordplay--pop culture references and
such.) Ad Verbum is a worthy successor: like Nord and Bert, not all of
it is particularly inspired, but the moments that work really, really
work.

The plot, again like Nord and Bert, is simply an excuse for wordplay
puzzles--you're looking through the Wizard of Wordplay's mansion and
moving through various rooms that are devoted to specific types of
wordplay, thereby to collect objects. Many of the puzzles are a bit
obscure, and some are only tangentially related to wordplay--or, rather,
involve forms of wordplay that aren't necessarily familiar to anyone but
the most hardened of GAMES magazine addicts. (One puzzle that involves
moving a sofa down a flight of stairs is particularly baffling to those
not on the author's wavelength.) Another, involving a little boy who's a
dinosaur fan, I found simply misleading--at least, the solution
suggested in the hints was something of a surprise to me.

The heart of the game, however, lies on the "initial" floor of the
house: there are passages lying to the north, east, west, and south, and
going north yields this:

   "LISTEN WELL!" a sonorous voice booms out, in attempted hollowness.
   "Know ye that passage back through here is difficult for some,
   impossible for others! Should you wish to transport yourself -
   without your cherished possessions - out of these constrained
   confines, utter the magic command: NEW!"

   Neat Nursery
   Nice, nondescript nursery, noticeably neat. Normally, nurslings
   nestle noisily. Now, none. No needful, naive newborns.

   Nearby: ... nifty nappy.

The parser, as you might have guessed, has been rewritten to require
that every word of every command begin with N. Violating the rules
elicits "No! No! Negative, novice. Nasty notation." or "No! No!
Nefarious nomenclature. Narrate nicely, now." The NEW command mentioned
above is your only way of getting out of the room: RESTORE, QUIT and
everything else has been disabled. Needless to say, in the rooms to the
east, west and south, the parser has been similarly reworked for the
appropriate letter. You have a goal for each room--extracting some
objects and getting out of the room, using only the appropriate
letters--but even after the goal is accomplished, it's worth hanging
around to experiment with the alliterative parser. The results are more
often than not hilarious, as with the following:

   >nip nappy
   Naughty, naughty! Nibbling nappies not normal.

Or:

   >examine effigy
   Enemy effigy. Extreme enormity evident. Execrable evildoer!

There's plenty more amusing stuff in each room: the parser-rewriting was
done with plenty of intelligence and wit. (WAIL in the appropriate room
elicits "Waaaah!", which amuses me no end for some reason.) In short:
nicely notated, Nick! Erudite, esoteric effusions entertain endlessly.
Winsome, witty wizardry will woo wordsmiths, who will whisper "Wow!"
without wearying. Surely, such semantic skill should solicit
stratospheric scores.

There are some variants on the alliterative parser--another S room with
another restriction, and a room with objects whose content suggests that
the proper TAKE replacement for each object will involve
letter-avoidance of one sort or another. (There was a nasty bug in the
competition version of this room that has been squashed--naturally, the
game in the updated version reports a literal squashed bug.) The parser
is not, however, rewritten for each object, so most of the fun of the
alliterative rooms is lost, and only the wordplay puzzle remains. It's a
fine puzzle, of course, but it doesn't have the same effect. The other
puzzles are likewise not nearly as inspired--there's a "twin bedroom"
that requires that all commands be in the form >HAMMER HAMMER, but there
isn't nearly as much room for experimenting there.

To the extent that Ad Verbum works--and it depends mostly, I think, on
the extent to which the player is amused by the alliterative rooms--it
works for different reasons than Nord and Bert worked. The latter called
for all sorts of cleverness from the player, and getting through it
produced a real feeling of accomplishment; some of the puzzles were
quite difficult. In particular, certain scenarios required that the
player deploy various clich&#233;s or idioms, often in amusingly twisted
ways, to get through the scene--and not a small amount of creativity was
required. Ad Verbum doesn't ask nearly as much of the player--the most
difficult feat of wordplay is clearly coming up with the appropriate
alliterative words, and in most rooms that's not especially difficult.
(Getting out of the N room is a challenge--sufficiently obscure that if
you go in there without first encountering the fellow who wanders around
dropping hints, you're unlikely to get it--but the others are pretty
straightforward.) But the author here has put his own skills on display,
much more so than the Nord and Bert authors did, and the result is just
as amusing. In other words, the fun is more passive here than it was in
Nord and Bert--the interactivity isn't as important--but there's still
fun to be had.

Ad Verbum is not an unqualified success; without the alliterative
parser, I don't think there'd be much interesting about it. But I got
enough laughs out of those rooms that I can't give it anything less than
a 9.

 NAME:  Adventure                       GAMEPLAY:  Two Word parser
 AUTHOR:  Will Crowther                 PLOT:  Good
 EMAIL:  I wish I knew                  ATMOSPHERE:  Tolkienic
 AVAILABILITY:  IF Archive              WRITING:  Very Good
 PUZZLES:  Many trial & error           SUPPORTS:  Practically all
 CHARACTERS:  Few, but memorable        DIFFICULTY:  Average

     Adventure, aka Colossal Cave, is the oldest, most famous, most
modified, most ported, and most pirated game in the history of
Interactive Fiction.  Written in the antiquity of the mid 70's, it was
bootlegged to practically every university in the country on magnetic
tape.  It was commercially released by several companies (such as The
Software Toolworks), and has been ported to AGT, TADS, Inform, and
several others.
     It has also been expanded several times.  Many authors have taken
the layout of the original game and simply added new rooms, items, and
puzzles.  For this reason, the game is usually referred to by the
maximum number of points that can be scored.  For instance Adventure
350 (the original version), Adventure 370, Adventure 550, Adventure
1000, and so on.
     Adventure could also be said to be indirectly responsible for the
entire Infocom product line.  The original mainframe Zork was begun
when the authors played Adventure and believed that they could improve
on it, especially vis a vis the parser.  <a href = "z.html#zorktril">Zork</a>, the product of their
efforts, was the foundation of Infocom, and owes heavily to Adventure.
The words &quot;xyzzy&quot; and &quot;plugh&quot; will draw a response, and the thief's
maze is lifted directly from the game.
     All in all, one might conclude from this that Adventure is the
greatest Adventure game ever written, but this is not quite the case.
It's continued popularity stems from a) its hauntingly compelling
atmosphere, b) its colourful imagery, c) the fact that for many it was
their first adventure game, and d) the fact that many people first
played it 70's style.
     Playing a game 70's style was very different from playing today. 
Since there were few personal computers, playing a game usually
involved a trip to the local university computer room, generally after
hours, with a bag lunch in tow (since the session would usually last
quite a while).  My own first experience with Adventure involved
late-night trips to IBM with my programmer father.  The long trek
through dimly-lit windowless corridors to the terminal room was
practically an adventure in itself, and since you couldn't 
just go and play whenever you wanted to, the game had plenty of
opportunity to grow larger in the imagination in between sessions.
     Also, a player is more likely to be forgiving of a first game than
later ones.  When you have never seen such a game before and are not
quite sure what it can understand or do, you won't mind a simple
two-word parser, such as Adventure has, unless it is positively
user-unfriendly.  Adventure's parser while simple, is adequate for the
game, and produces a good effect by frequently addressing the user
directly (&quot;You don't expect me to do a decent reincarnation without any
orange smoke, do you?&quot;).

     Adventure is loaded with memorable imagery (Witt's End, the maze
of twisty little passages, the Pirate, the breath-taking view, &quot;xyzzy,&quot;
et cetera) that generally stays with a player long after the game is
completed.  
     The atmosphere is wonderfully authentic.  The game map was based
on Bedquilt Cave in Kentucky, part of the Mammoth Cave labyrinth. 
While there are no dragons in Bedquilt, it is said that first-time
visitors have been able to find their way around by virtue of having
played the game.  While Zork is simply a collection of interesting
locales that just happen to be underground, Adventure resembles a real
cavern much more, featuring dead ends, fissures, blocked passages, and
passages in the floor.  As in Tolkien, magic in Adventure is present,
but tantalizingly remote; not coming out the wazoo, as it is in Zork
and most other fantasy games.
     Nevertheless Adventure is not without its problems.  As mentioned 
previously, the parser is rather primitive, at least in the original
version (the TADS and Inform ports have state-of-the-art parsers).
     Also the puzzles are frequently meant to be solved by trial and
error rather than deduction.  How are you supposed to figure out what
to do with the rod, or how to kill the dragon, or how to bring light to
the Dark Room, or how to recover the Golden Eggs, or how to get that
final point, anyway?  By experimenting, that's how.  Of course, in a
first game players are often much more inclined to experiment with it
to discover its capabilities.
     That's not to say that there aren't some good puzzles as well. 
The object that you need to win at the end is very cleverly concealed,
and only the keen-eyed will detect the subtle difference between the
vending machine maze and the Pirate's maze that allows you to map the
former without dropping objects (unfortunately, this feature is not
present in the Inform version).
     There are no save/restore puzzles as such.  It is possible to win
on the first playthrough, but not to achieve the maximum score.  If you
take too long (and you will), you will be forced to expend one of your
treasures to recharge your lamp (thus lowering your score), but after
you have solved the game, it will be a simple matter to optimize your
time and win before this becomes necessary.
     Adventure is an adventure game that every text gamer should play
some  time in their lives; the only game that has a genre named after
it.  But it would be best to stick with Adventure 350 in either its
original form, or the TADS or Inform ports.  The add-ons of the larger
versions simply make the game bulkier and clunkier without improving
the gaming experience.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag22.html">SPAG #22</a> -- September 15, 2000

Adventure is the first adventure game ever. This was played on
mainframes actually. I remember how my uncle would tell how he used to
work on a mainframe with other people, and the only game available to
them was Adventure. Its output was printed on paper rather than on a
screen. They were never able to beat it, though.

I got this game from a friend, and I was really excited about it because
of what my uncle had told me. I got hooked quickly. I would keep on
playing this game and making rapid progress. The only two reasons why I
didn't get to the last puzzle in one sitting are probably because I was
forced off the game by mother a few times and because of the two mazes
in the game. Back then, I wasn't as good at finding my way around mazes
with twisty passages as I am now.

Not surprisingly, the game is pretty simple in some ways. For instance,
the two-word parser. Another is that the characters are really simple
and have basically no personality. Howver, this is not really a
complaint. These two things don't need to be any more complicated than
they are for the game.

As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this game. The nice thing
about it is that most of the puzzles are logical and not too easy or too
difficult. One of my favorite ones is the one where you have to figure
out how to bring into this dark room. I thought was a really clever
puzzle because you have to use cleverness to do it.

However, there were about two exceptions to this rule. Figuring out how
to get in the cave was pretty easy, and the very last puzzle was
definitely too difficult. [Further comments removed due to spoilers.
--Paul]

Another complaint I have about this game is the random fighting that you
do with the dwarfs. After one of them throws an axe at you and misses,
you're supposed to pick it up and throw at dwarfs when they appear and
start throwing knives at you. Whether you hit them and whether they hit
you is just chance. This simply gets in the way of the game. I think it
would have been better if you had to get rid of those particular dwarfs
by solving puzzles. Of course, the very last puzzle gets rid of all of
them but still.

Another one is that when you die, you don't just die; you can get
reincarnated into a different body and get another. I think it would
have been better to have taken this feature out so as to make the game a
little more realistic and to make players more cautious by saving their
games.

Overall, this is a great game. I recommend it to everyone who is
interested in adventure games. It is interesting to compare this game to
more recent adventure games to see how much things have changed since
then. For instance, in Adventure, you can only look at rooms; you can't
look at objects. In most adventure games written since then, you can do
both.

My points for the game are this:
Atmosphere: 1.7
Gameplay:   1
Writing:    1.2
Plot:       1.1
Fantasy:    1.5 
Total:      6.5

     In THE ADVENTURES OF ELIZABETH (EL) HIGHE, you play Elizabeth
Highe, a game designer for Sierra who must write a sequel to the 
hit, G-String Gertrude so that Ken and Roberta Williams will allow her
to leave the building (all the names have been slightly changed, of
course; i.e. Sierra to Appalachia, Roberta Williams to Robert Bills,
etc.).  You write your game by entering the computer (in a manner
similar to the movie TRON) and physically retrieving it.
     The AGT manual, in describing various uses for adventure games,
suggests that you could write a game about your co-workers and 
play it on a Friday afternoon.  This seems to be exactly what Bill
Larkins has done here (though I don't know if he ever worked for 
Sierra).  The game is short (I was able to complete it in 42 moves),
simple and lighthearted.
     The AGT parser is much maligned, but is really as good as the
author makes it.  It doesn't do much in this game, but it doesn't need
to.  The only problem I encountered was when I performed one important
action and got no response at all, even though the action was registered.
Some might mistakenly take this to mean that the action was not important
and get sidetracked.  The game is meant to be simple, cute, and quickly
over, and it is.

This game only placed 21st in this year's IF Comp, but the name and the
Finnish author attracted my attention enough to make me decide that I&#8217;m
going to try to save my reputation after the horrid review of <a href = "e.html#escape">Pulsar 7</a>
by reviewing this.

This is a short game that I think is supposed to be funny, but it
doesn&#8217;t quite achieve its purpose. First of all, I don&#8217;t find it
particularly funny, and second, it isn&#8217;t very easy to complete because
of its technical imperfections.

The basic idea is great. You are the (unnamed) president of the United
States. But since the White House is such a boring place, allowing
nothing beyond the destroying the world as entertainment, you decide to
go on an adventure. Unfortunately, an over-protective secret service
agent doesn&#8217;t allow you to go and there you have your first puzzle.

The biggest problem of the game is that it seems to be written too
hastily. The room descriptions are insufficient and the parser doesn&#8217;t
allow you to look for details except in a few places. That makes the
simple puzzles quite hard to solve; I have to admit that I had to
consult the walkthrough several times only to find that the solution was
right there in front of my face, but I couldn't have known it since it
didn&#8217;t appear in the room description.

I liked the idea that after you get out of the White House, rooms are
countries. I don&#8217;t know if it has been done before, but that really gave
a refreshing difference to the game. In your journeys as the president
you get to visit Mexico, Canada, Russia, Finland and Sweden. In Finland
you actually get to learn some Finnish.

I didn&#8217;t like the fact that the player isn&#8217;t given any purpose other
than the need to go out on an adventure. I know that this is one way of
designing a game, but I&#8217;ve always liked when the player is given a
purpose and a goal he needs to accomplish to get on with the game. When
a game combines this sort of purposelessness with bad room descriptions,
you&#8217;re in for a lot of headaches if you don&#8217;t resort to the solution
file.

The parser is also quite limited. The author says he tried to avoid
guess-the-verb puzzles this time, but unfortunately the parser
understands only one way of expressing yourself most of the time and you
have to guess a lot while playing. I didn&#8217;t find any actual bugs though.

So, to summarise: The game's basic idea has potential and the
room-country design is refreshing, but the game falls to its technical
problems. If the author would&#8217;ve given some more time to actual
programming and to the room descriptions, this would&#8217;ve been a quite
entertaining game.

VERSION: Release 1

Sam Barlow's Aisle is without a doubt one of the most unusual works to hit
the IF community in quite some time. In no sense is it a game; trying to
&quot;win&quot; it is futile, and the suboptimal outcomes aren't bad choices to be
avoided as such. Rather, the point is to explore the central character and
take a look at the various possibilities available to him from one point
in time. That said, however, it's not clear that Aisle is an entirely
successful experiment. 

The premise is simple: the game has one move, and it &quot;ends&quot; after that
move and automatically sends you back to your original position. By
interacting with what's around you -- and by incorporating knowledge 
gained thereby into future moves -- you learn about your own character and
make sense of his various neuroses, fears, and hangups (to some degree, 
anyway). In the process, you get a sense -- at least, I did -- that your
character, in this one move, is at a crossroads of sorts (or, at least,
that the moment can mark a turning point, a change, if treated that way),
and you take a look at where various paths might lead. In a sense, it's IF
compressed -- while most good IF lets the player decide how a story will
come out, to some extent, but draws that input out over several dozen or
hundred moves, Aisle limits the input to one turn and tells the rest of
the story for you. This structure allows the author to greatly multiply
the range of options available, of course.

In practice, however, Aisle can be thoroughly confusing--in part because
the author both lets the player discover the PC's past and gives the PC
multiple pasts to discover. The player might therefore initially assume
that the key to understanding the player is piecing together his
memories -- but there are too many memories that are inconsistent, 
incapable of fitting together, to do that successfully. As a result, it's 
difficult to make sense of what the PC does in the present, given that he 
has multiple pasts which might or might not explain his actions, and the
character splinters into several parts, Sybil-like. The command &quot;think
about&quot; or &quot;remember&quot; gives the player access to the PC's past, which is
handy -- but the significance of the events recalled is largely a matter 
of interpretation.

Though this may be a product of the assumptions built into most IF (i.e.,
polite conversations are rare), it also seemed that most of the PC's
options at this moment in time are profoundly antisocial; many involve
violence, many of the other options are simply bizarre, and your character
often treats apparently normal conversational gambits as an excuse to act
psychotic. All this has its place, of course -- the PC is supposed to be
unhappy and under stress -- but it does make Aisle a bit tedious after a
while, when the options for civilized behavior run out.

On the other hand, many of Aisle's outcomes are quite effective on an
emotional level, product of antisocial behavior or not; there is a strong
sense in many of the scenarios that the PC doesn't really know why he does
what he does. (Which, of course, puts him in the same boat as the player.)
Whether intended this way or not, it's an intriguing take on the player-PC
relationship in works of IF, since the player is free to tell the PC to do
irrational, bizarre, or suicidal things -- but here the consequences of
those irrational actions, and their effect on the PC, are played out again
and again. Thus, as unattractive as the PC occasionally seems, it's hard
to entirely lose one's sympathies for him. Since most of the story
revolves around the PC's emotions, the player's reaction to the PC
determines her reaction to the story as a whole, however -- and it should
also be noted that the repetitive nature of the game, and the sameness of
most of the outcomes, may tax the patience of the player and erode her
sympathy for the hapless antisocial PC.

The writing, on the whole, is strong -- memories come back to the PC in
jumbled, scattered fragments that force the player to cobble together the
story (or one of the stories), and the fragments -- a pasta meal, a 
waiter, an accident -- are vividly rendered, with striking images to carry 
them along. (It would spoil the game, however, to reveal what the images 
are.) The technical aspect, though obviously very simplified, is likewise 
well done; most actions, logical and illogical, are provided for, and 
those that aren't generally are omitted for a good reason.

It's difficult to say, in the final analysis, what Aisle is setting out to
do. If the point was simply to experiment with the classical IF form, this
was clearly a successful effort. But the introspective nature of the game
leads one to believe that the point is to portray a character and paint
his emotional portrait, and the effectiveness of that aim turns on the
player's reaction. For those who don't care for the PC or for his
behavior, Aisle gets old fast, and there isn't much flexibility for the
player to try to send the PC in different directions or otherwise change
his ways. The lack of any sort of cathartic finale also means that the
story always feels incomplete: the player is likely to try a series of
options, eventually conclude there is nothing more to see, and quit, with
no particularly resonant ending to make the whole thing more emotionally
satisfying.

Aisle is an interesting idea that has its moments, and it's worth a look
for anyone interested in the theory of IF. Its effectiveness depends on
whether it makes an emotional impact, however, and without such an impact,
it's a dreary experience at best.

VERSION: Release 1

In this game, you play a Japanese teenager on a typical weekend day (in other 
words, no school!)  I would place this piece of IF in the "slice-of-life" genre 
and the game does do a relatively good job of faithfully simulating Akari's 
daily life.  Unfortunately, that simulation can sometimes be a little bit 
pedantic in the sense that it provides little in the way of "escape value."  I 
wasn't particularly caught up in the story or involved in the action, despite 
the fact that the world-modeling implementation was adequate.  Along those same 
lines, Akari's day lacked a sense of urgency or any clear goals.  Accordingly, 
there wasn't very much to command action or to require much of the PC.

The walkthrough reveals that the game ends after a certain number of turns. at 
the end of the day, so to speak.  So, there is no real way to "win" the game, 
although there is a scoring system that awards points for certain actions.  The 
walkthrough also revealed that I tried many of the actions that the author had 
in mind, while there were others that I missed completely and would have never 
thought of had I not read the walkthrough.

One of the most interesting aspects of this piece is that it DOES provide 
insight into another culture (unless, of course, you happen to be a Japanese 
teenager yourself!)  Japanese customs and terminology and even dietary 
preferences are woven into the game, which is quite intriguing!  The game also 
reveals a bit about what is important to modern Japanese youngsters. also neat 
to know.  On the downside, this may have the effect of making the player feel 
more like a spectator than a participant.  It is as if one is observing Akari's 
life, rather than participating in it or living it, which makes the pace of the 
work feel rather slow at times.

The writing is rather sparse, in the sense that room descriptions are relatively 
brief and many nouns are non-examinable.  Still, I didn't note any particularly 
jarring errors in grammar or spelling, which certainly helped make for a 
pleasant reading experience in that regard.  In short, however, I felt much as 
if I was reading an essay by a Japanese teenager about her life, rather than 
playing a game.

There are puzzles in the game and they are reasonably well-crafted, although 
certainly not complicated.  I wish there had been more of a sense of payoff to 
successfully solving the puzzles, however.  Because the problems posed were 
essentially of the routine, day-to-day variety, and there was very little 
urgency, it didn't seem to matter much whether I solved the puzzles or not.  The 
only real impact for doing so was the point value added to my score for 
performing certain actions.

The characters in the game were largely undeveloped, except for the PC.  All of 
the NPCs felt rather static and cardboard to me, almost as if they were objects 
rather than characters.   Conversation is minimal, except if you happen to guess 
the few things that the author has allowed you to "ask [character] about," but 
this is not an uncommon problem by any means.

As for plot and story, both were a little thin.  Without a compelling goal to 
spur action, the experience was much more like an exploration than an 
interactive narrative.  Game play progressed smoothly, though, with little 
evidence of "bugginess."  There was an occurrence or two of "guess the verb," 
but I found those issues to be relatively easily solved and certainly not game-
stoppers.  A reading of the walkthrough definitely revealed several cases of 
"read the author's mind" and in each case, I had failed to do so.

In conclusion, this game could be much improved by augmenting descriptions to 
add atmosphere and capture the attention of the player, as well as implementing 
more variety and innovation in the tasks of the PC to make for a more compelling 
story line.

Overall rating:  ** out of ***** for faithful simulation, fair puzzles, and 
cross-cultural value.

We've all seen it in many games, especially RPGs. Your character wakes
up and has no idea who he or she is. Amnesia sets in. In "Akron", this
is also true. However, when your character wakes up, he's in --
surprise! -- Akron, Ohio. It's where you live, you remember that much. And
so you tromp all over Akron (or a certain part of it at least, because I
don't think it's really that small) trying to search for who you are.

So far so serious. However, when you stumble onto a cornfield, you get
this description:

   You have blundered into a cornfield. Oh my. It looks like this is
   another one of those annoying mazes that the programmer loves so
   much. Well, let me give you a little hint - just go NORTH and you'll
   be out of the maze! You see, I, the computer, have changed this game
   JUST FOR YOU! Or, I can - oh no. The programmer's coming.
   AIEEEEEEEEEEEEE...

The rest of the game follows suit, of course. In fact, the rest of the
game is even *wackier*. (I would give you an example, but that would be
spoiling.)

The NPC's in this game are almost lifeless. The only one I could strike
up a conversation with, was the cop, and that was because he was a clue
to the game. Also, the game bugs are few, but drastic (for example, you
can't pick up the library card).

Some parts of "Akron" were endearing, others just irritating and
mind-boggling. I didn't think this game was very good, but nor very bad.
My advice: Pick it up if you are interested. If you like it, good. If
not, just get rid of it. It's not going to be everyone's cup of meat.

It's hard to believe that this is the very first serious game about
aliens.  Oh, there have been the pulp sci-fi offerings (&quot;<A HREF="l.html#leather">LGOP</A>,&quot; for
instance), and the typical plot-forming UFO abduction (as seen in
&quot;<A HREF="w.html#waystation">Waystation</A>,&quot; &quot;<A HREF="p.html#plague">Plague Planet</A>,&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;), but I can't recall ever
seeing a work of I-F that deals with the anomaly from a standpoint
that does justice to the phenomenon.

Overall, the story is quite linear, with a number of plot points
slightly less than intuitive.  The quality of prose fluctuates.  Most
disappointing is the interior of the ship, which offers simply a bland
description of how you're in a place you never expected to be, leaving
few details for the imagination to work with.  Other bits, such as the
click of an automaton's eyes and the ripping of a wire from your neck,
never failed to make my skin crawl.  Puzzles range from subtle (the
conversations with NPCs, which allow the aliens to adjust their illusion
of your world) to blatantly gratuitous (the colored shapes aboard the
ship, and the crystal duck in the woods) and a number of tasks which
never quite escape the &quot;give &lt;x&gt; to &lt;y&gt;&quot; feel.  Most are enjoyable
regardless.

Particularly enjoyable is the fact that the ending leaves you uncertain
as to what really happened, hence the question mark in the game's title.
Was it really an alien encounter?  Or might you have really lost your
mind?  Which seems more probable?  Also, it's truly creepy how the
aliens use your thoughts to build and expand the artificial reality
they've trapped you in.  I congratulate the author for this inventive
work of I-F.

And I'll congratulate myself as well.  I got through this whole review
without even once mentioning &quot;The X-Files.&quot;  Oop- DAMN!!


From: Duncan Stevens &lt;dnrb SP@G starpower.net&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag26.html">SPAG #26</a> -- September 26, 2001

One of the many trends in IF of recent years has been to emphasize
characterization, and in particular the character of the player
character, over puzzles. An early portent of that trend was Charles
Gerlach's Alien Abduction?, a 1996 competition entry that endeavors to
make the PC something other than a cipher. The result isn't a total
triumph, mostly because the game didn't fully emancipate itself from
puzzlefest expectations, but it's an interesting attempt.

It seems you're convinced that aliens are out to abduct you; a similar
conviction landed your father in an asylum, but you know what you know.
Sure enough, aliens do come by and -- after making you play a variant on
Mastermind -- release you again, but the reality you go back to has some
incongruities, notably that your father is back, showing no signs of
having been carted away. Your goal, at that point, is to make sense of
the incongruities.

At least, I think so, and therein lies the difficulty. It's far from
clear to the player at that point what he or she should be doing; that
things seem to be a little off-kilter doesn't point the player in any
particular direction for purposes of addressing the problem, and nothing
that you find as you explore the off-kilter world (which is quite small
as it is) is particularly illuminating. You can talk to your father, and
while he has quite a lot to say, nothing really gives you much of a clue
about what you're supposed to be doing. The solution isn't wholly
illogical, it turns out, but it requires some fairly tortured inferences
about various characters and how they react to certain stimuli.
Considering that this puzzle is the heart of the game -- there are
several subpuzzles, but most of the game is given over to one central
problem -- not having a sense of what you're doing is a major flaw. This
isn't a characterization problem, as such -- there are good reasons for
the PC to do what he does. It's just that the player doesn't know enough
about the PC (and his past) to understand those reasons.

The problem springs in part from the game's attempts at giving the PC a
specific identity and background, since the solution to the central problem
hinges on the player's having a much deeper understanding of that background
than seems likely, given the available evidence. Specifically, the problem
turns on a certain NPC's psychology, for the most part, and the game didn't
provide enough exposition to permit the player to draw the right inferences.
This is good, in a certain respect; NPCs with psychological makeup more
complex than some variant on "feed me" are relatively uncommon. That also
means, however, that the player cannot necessarily be counted on to see what
the author wants him/her to see, unless the author spells everything out in
nice big letters (which defeats the point, to some extent). Here, there are
clues scattered around, but it's a fairly long leap from the clues to the
solution. (A related problem is that the solution requires inferring that a
certain bit of technology has what seems a grave flaw; I certainly didn't
find any suggestions that there was such a flaw.)

Mostly because of those psychological intricacies, Alien Abduction? is a
pretty difficult game -- it's entirely possible that you, the player,
will stumble on the solution by accident, but that's not exactly
satisfying. There are, let me emphasize, internal hints, and those are
handy indeed -- and the game as a whole has a certain twisted logic once
you understand what's going on. It seemed to me, however, that there
wasn't much chance of the player attaining such an understanding without
the hints. There's also one rather artificial puzzle (a.k.a. a "soup
can" puzzle) -- the presence of the aliens supplies an excuse (they're
testing you, you see), but not a great excuse, and the game would have
been better, I think, had that puzzle been omitted.

While Alien Abduction? doesn't quite work as a fusion of puzzle-solving
challenge and character study, it does work as a mood piece and as a
mess-with-your-head game in the tradition of <a href = "d.html#delusions">Delusions</a> and <a href = "s.html#spider">Spider and
Web</a>. (Yes, I'm aware that this preceded Spider and Web, but that's the
paradigmatic example.) The discover-what's-going-on process is
thoroughly creepy -- there's no big payoff, but there's a series of
smaller surprises that effectively kept me guessing. The
almost-normality of the setting works nicely (though it might have
worked even better if the game gave the player more of a chance to
explore the layout at the beginning, the better to appreciate the
changes, <a href = "w.html#wishbringer">Wishbringer</a>-style; as it is, the game mostly tells the player
"hey, this and that are different"), and lots of relatively nonessential
objects and conversation topics are implemented, so the player isn't
likely to keep running up against the game's boundaries (never a good
thing in a mood piece). As for the mess-with-your-head factor, the game
does a nice job of raising doubts about the PC's sanity and reliability,
though those doubts are largely tangential to what actually goes on in
the game; you may question whether the PC's perceptions are true, but
you can largely assume that they are for purposes of getting through the
game. That aside, unreliable narrators are a fun device, central to the
progress of the story or not.

How well Alien Abduction? works is a function of the player's
expectations, I suppose -- it's certainly a well-written game with some
suspenseful moments and good deal of atmosphere, and if you're someone
who enjoys IF that emphasizes setting and mood, and who doesn't care
overmuch about being able to solve the puzzles without reliance on
hints, this is definitely for you. (I'm sure I'll hear from people
claiming to have finished the game with no hints in seconds flat, but I
call 'em like I see 'em, and I just don't see enough in the game to
enable the player to understand the logic of the puzzles ex ante.) In
that respect, the intervening years have made the IF audience somewhat
more receptive to this game -- a well-crafted story with
not-entirely-well-crafted puzzles is perhaps more welcome now than it
was in 1996, though the tendency these days, I think, is to omit or
downplay the puzzles. (In other words, the tendency for an author
writing this game now might be to let the PC make some of the trickier
inferences himself, rather than making the player do it; the
interactivity would be thereby reduced, of course, but life is full of
tradeoffs.) To the extent that Alien Abduction? tries to squeeze both
challenging puzzles and some complex personalities and character
interactions into the same game, it's a laudable effort; to the extent
that it doesn't quite succeed, well, not many games can be called a
total success on both those levels, and this was an early shot at it.
It's not a roaring success, but it certainly has its moments.

VERSION: First release

Ian Finley's IF output has been varied thus far: <a href = "b.html#babel">Babel</a>, his 1997
competition entry, was science fiction of a distinctly dark shade, and
<a href = "e.html#exhibition">Exhibition</a>, from the 1999 competition, was a puzzleless exploration of
an artist's works through the eyes of four different viewers. All Alone,
his latest effort, has echoes of both: like Babel, it's highly
atmospheric (and dark), and like Exhibition, there are no real puzzles
as such. But this one is from the realm of horror/suspense--the author
calls it "play-in-the-dark-ware" and says that "it MUST be played at
night, in a quiet room, with the lights off"--and to the extent it works
(which, for the most part, it does), it works on a different level.

The plot, by initial appearances, is conventional stalker horror: you're
waiting for your husband to come home, listening to the TV announcer
talk about the serial killer who's on the loose, but then, of course,
the power goes out, and you start hearing noises. The tension builds
nicely, with all the requisite horror touches--a storm raging outside, a
strange phone call, etc.; in fact, the only problem with the plot is
that it doesn't do much that could be considered surprising (with the
possible exception of a cockroach crawling over your foot at a key
moment). The point, it seems safe to say, is to create an atmospheric
game, not to experiment with the genre, but it's also true that the
trajectory is familiar.

On the other hand, All Alone does do one thing that's interesting: it
leaves several details of the plot so murky that you probably won't
catch on the first time through, and you may not even pick up on them
after that. Of course, horror/suspense plots require some degree of
murkiness about what precisely is going on, but usually there's a moment
where Everything Becomes Clear; here, there's no such moment. As such,
the ending of the game may leave you a bit flatfooted, especially since
the game sort of skips directly from the climax to the ending: the
tension builds, the moment arrives, and suddenly it's over, with the
details almost as obscure as they were during the buildup. It's an odd
strategic choice, really--perhaps the author means to encourage replay
to figure out the fuzzier bits, but horror loses a lot on the replay.
Whatever the rationale, it moves the game out of the realm of familiar
stalker horror into something more unusual.

There are no puzzles in All Alone, as noted. You experience the story
differently if you react to the various stimuli in different ways, but
only marginally so, and you can't actually change the course of the
story (at least, as far as I can tell). The author calls it a "mood
piece," and that's how it works: your inability to affect what goes on
actually enhances the mood, since it enhances the feeling of being the
prey. In that respect, it's a good illustration of how interactivity and
player involvement can be achieved without the aid of puzzles: true,
this sort of story doesn't have to be very interactive to keep the
player's interest, but the author does tell it well.

All Alone is a short but well put together effort that adapts the horror
genre to IF nicely, with some unusual elements. Give it a try if you
have a spare 10 minutes late at night.

VERSION: 1

Only a well-done game can successfully combine such elements as a rather 
detailed plot, puzzles of all sorts, a theologically dense theme, and Greek 
alphabet characters. "All Hope Abandon," though the prospect seems dizzying in 
retrospect, does all of the above and somehow manages to seem somewhat natural. 
This feeling of being natural is not inherent; this is especially apparent early 
on when the player is quickly thrown into the deep end at which point the game 
world seems like a disgruntled fairy tale. Thankfully, this "fairy tale" feeling 
soon dissipates into the more interesting scheme of the game.

The player is cast as Dr William Fisher, a New Testament scholar, who at the 
opening of the game is found listening to the lecture of the deranged Professor 
Wortschlachter. Earlier at breakfast, William had met a pretty blond woman who 
somehow also ends up trapped in Limbo land (though the reason this happens is 
never adequately explained -- I think on purpose). Apart from adding a little 
romance to the story, she serves to symbolize the theme of hope throughout the 
game.

The text is not overly complex or "purple," but is sufficient and usually easy 
to read. Sometimes the writing even has a slight pinch of wit, such as in the 
introductory text. The game is very detailed -- even unnecessary objects are 
carefully described. A "THINK" verb is implement which allows the player to 
THINK ABOUT certain topics, and I found the responses to cover mostly everything 
that could be thought about.

The detail in prose and design is complimented by many puzzles. These puzzles 
come in a range of difficulty, generally becoming more difficult as the game 
progresses. The solutions to quite a few of these at least partially require the 
player to scrutinize every single detail of an important object. This sounds 
tedious, but it works alright because one gets used to the high level of 
implementation and also because the puzzles all at least require some level of 
critical thinking besides just examining. The game is structured so that it is 
quite easy to finish the game without having solved all the puzzles, and thus 
without having tied up all the loose plot ends. This is a result of the 
integration of the narrative and the puzzles, and gives the game more 
replayability than most interactive fiction games out there.

Even with its great puzzles and well-done story, "All Hope Abandon" would be a 
mediocre game if it was riddled with bugs and grammatical errors. This is not 
the case; it is clear that the game was carefully tested. Everything works as 
expected, and it does not appear possible to get the game into a state that was 
not anticipated by the author. I must report that I did find one accidental 
typo; however, but if you can get over such things it will not lessen the 
quality of the game for you.

In conclusion, "All Hope Abandon" by Eric Eve is an extremely well-done work. I 
would definitely commend it to your "to play" list if you have not played it 
yet. If you never play it, you should know that you are missing out on one of 
the best games to be released last year.

I know, I know -- a decent review has to start with some smart preamble on a
more or less abstract topic; unfortunately, I couldn't think of any for All
Hope Abandon. So please excuse me just for this once, and let's move on to
business.

The theme of this game is probably best defined as "subconscious jorney".
However, if the author was trying (please note the conditional mood) to
create a dreamlike atmosphere that suggests itself for a work of that kind,
he didn't succeed too well. Anyway, no matter what the author's intentions
were -- the game more than makes up for it by providing a stunning cocktail
of adventure, theology, and romance, all that spiced with a good shot of
irony. Several ways to victory are laid through it; and although the
denouement is rather predictable at the end of the day -- the rich,
intentionally anachronistic setting full of gadgets to fiddle with, and the
considerable variety of the paths provided make it worth replaying the game
several times to try out each of them.

Another aspect of All Hope Abandon, which was especially pleasant personally
for me: it doesn't act overly symbolic, although, again, it'd be very much in
the tradition of the genre. You know, symbolism is just not my mug of beer,
and games relying on it too much often leave me puzzled. On the other hand,
the fact AHA sets forth its main ideas clearly enough doesn't mean it's as
uncomplicated as a game as I am as a person;) -- I'm sure that players more
skilled at interpreting symbolic links than myself will be able to enjoy the
game on additional levels that remained inaccessible to me.

From the technical point of view, the game is faultless. In comparison with
the previous version, TADS 3 added several interface enhancements (for
instance, let's mention the menu-based built-in hints, and the topic
suggestions mechanism of the conversation system) on its own. All Hope
Abandon not only makes extensive use of these facilities, but introduces, in
its turn, a few more. The most interesting ones are the THINK ABOUT command,
and the ability of the player to look in a specific direction. The first
feature is one I've been looking forward to for a long time. Particularly in
this game, it seems all the more appropriate since the protagonist has some
"specialist knowledge that most players will probably not share"; besides,
it's smartly used in one of the puzzles. The second one probably wasn't as
challenging to implement from the technical point of view, but means A LOT
additional work for the game author (ten extra descriptions -- eight for
compass directions, and two for LOOK UP/DOWN -- in each room); even taking
into account they're more terse than the "main" room description, and that a
few of them are similar -- it's still a feat worthy of esteem.

At this point, I've taken a pause and looked at what I had written so far.
You can bet on it -- I'm utterly disappointed with the results: All Hope
Abandon is a great game that deserves an outstanding, or at least a memorable
review, not the generic stuff I sullied the (virtual) paper with. Of course,
any reviewer will tell you it's much easier to write a memorable review for
a flawed game; sure enough, All Hope Abandon doesn't offer much in this
respect. At best, one could complain about the puzzles being too easy, which 
isn't much of a drawback as times go, and the most sceptical among the
players would probably point out that the whole romantic plotline is a bit
unrealistic, considering the protagonist and his beloved barely knew each
other; well, I consider myself a cynical person, but not cynical enough for 
not believing in love at first sight, so this was OK for me. Still, the
unsufficient flaws of the game are a pretty lame excuse for my review being
so insipid.

I think the problem is, All Hope Abandon just arrived at a wrong point in my
life. The effect is like paying a visit to the British Museum at the very end
of an exhaustive sightseeing day trip through London: the overstrained
tourist feels there's a lot of things to admire, but the emotions just aren't
there. Thus, in spite of my review probably not sounding too enthusiastic,
let me assure you -- this game is a great work suitable practically for any
players, ranging from novices to the versed ones, and represents a glorious
showcase for the opportunities the new version of TADS offers.

  NAME: All Quiet on the Library Front   PARSER: Inform v1502
  AUTHOR: Michael Phillips               SUPPORTS: Infocom Ports
  EMAIL: ???                             AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
  ATMOSPHERE: Just a little thin         WRITING: Expository
  CHARACTERS: Cardboard                  PLOT: Linear
  PUZZLES: Quite simple                  DIFFICULTY: Easy

The premise is quite straightforward: you need to borrow a normally
unobtainable book from your college library in order to write a
research paper.  After a bit of wandering around, finding objects
lying about, and giving them to the appropriate people, you do.

I must confess that I was somewhat put off by the fact that the
game is set on a college campus; the college game is second only
to the <a href = "#advent">Colossal Cave</a>-style undirected dungeon crawl/scavenger hunt
for being drastically overdone.  It worked in <A HREF="l.html#lurk">_Lurking_Horror_</A>,
and it's working now in _Christminster_, whose setting is different
enough not to be stale, but every other such game since (not to
mention the innumerable campuses that have been set up on MUDs
worldwide) has felt like walking into someone else's inside joke.
That includes a number of rather popular games that have fallen
flat for me, and I'm probably stepping on a number of toes here;
I tried not to let my feelings for the genre color my judgement.

This entry doesn't just happen to take place on campus, however;
the entire plot is centered around writing a research paper, and
therein lies the problem.  Most IF transports the player to a
fantastic place or situation that's genuinely interesting, sometimes
more so than what's going on outside the screen.  That's not the
case here -- being stuck in the library working on an undergraduate
research paper is something that one plays IF to *escape*, not
encounter, and the game never really transcends the ultimately
pedestrian nature of its central task.

It is possible to create good interactive fiction based entirely
on everyday experiences if the writing stands out enough to carry
the game on atmosphere (see <A HREF="c.html#change">_A_Change_in_the_Weather_</A>, below).
It is also possible to make a good game out of a fundamentally
unpleasant situation (<A HREF="t.html#theatre">_Theatre_</A>, for example, or <A HREF="b.html#bureau">_Bureaucracy_</A>)
if the game provides gripping drama or offers a fresh perspective
on the events in question. _Library_ does neither, offering a
fairly routine scenario executed in expository but uninspiring
prose.

Oddly, the stairwell leading to the upper floor, an area in which
none of the plot takes place, is one of the game's bright spots as
far as writing goes -- the descriptions there are nearly as long
as in busier areas, which gives the author enough space to breathe
life into details like the paintings.  Had the rest of the map been
executed with that much care, the game would have worked much better.
It's not necessarily that more words are needed elsewhere (see
<A HREF="e.html#enchant">_Enchanter_</A>, for example), it's that more thought is needed to make
the descriptions come to life.

Overall, the game is solidly crafted, but feels like it's just
going through the motions.  This isn't a *bad* game by any means,
but somehow lacks that certain spark that makes well-written IF
such a joy.  Cleaned up and commented, the source to this would
probably make pretty good example code for new authors; it's solidly
crafted, including a basic help system that gives a hint for the next
puzzle.

(After writing most of this review, I learned that the entry was the
author's first attempt at writing IF.  It's obvious that the author
*has* in fact mastered the motions that need to be gone through to
create IF, and is just starting to catch on to a writing style; I
look forward to seeing full-length works from him in the future.)

BOTTOM LINE: An accurate simulation of a tedious chore.

VERSION: Release 1 (post-comp release -- version apparently not updated)

It's occasionally been said that the diversity of latter-day IF makes it
difficult to compare games -- when puzzles are downplayed and setting,
story, characterization, etc. are stressed, different games often have
very few common measures (other than technical smoothness and writing
skill) by which to rate them. Instead, games are judged more and more by
how well they were trying to do whatever they were trying to do, and as
measuring the success of, say, a horror-oriented game is very different
from measuring the success of a sci-fi game, it becomes harder to say in
a useful way that any given game is better than another. (Was it always
thus? Maybe, but I seem to recall some fairly lively debates, a few
years back in r*if, over which Infocom games were the best and worst --
despite Infocom's attempts to explore a broad range of genres.) I bring
this up not because I have any idea where Jon Ingold's All Roads stands
in the IF pantheon; to the contrary, I have no idea, because while it's
certainly an enjoyable game in many respects, I cannot divine what the
author was setting out to do.

The premise is that -- well, that's the problem. The initial text
suggests that you're lying in your bed, then abruptly you're standing on
a scaffold, about to be hanged, and a few turns later, just as abruptly,
you're tied up in a cellar. From there, things slow down a little, but
the general "huh?" aura persists throughout -- you jump around in time
and space enough that you're unlikely to follow what's going on until
the very end. It doesn't, however, matter much that you don't know
what's going on, as the game shepherds you along quite firmly -- you
can't get very far off the track at any point, nor is there a way, as
far as I can tell, to derail the express by dying or making the game
unwinnable. (Well, okay, there's one puzzle, and it's a fairly subtle
puzzle, sufficiently so that it's not impossible to bog down -- but
other than that things more or less roll along.) The plot itself
involves political machinations in a sort of alternate-universe medieval
Venice, certainly a good setting for not knowing what's going on, and
the game plays that aspect to the hilt -- most of the salient facts,
such as who's on what side, remain mysterious throughout, adding to the
general bewilderment. At a few points, if you don't supply the needed
action, the game gives you progressively less subtle hints, so the
course of the story is unlikely to stop very often. The result, at the
end of the game, is essentially a very odd short story where you supply
much of the protagonist s action but very little of the brainpower.

Give All Roads some credit, though -- the player does *do* almost
everything in the story, as opposed to watching his friend the player
character do things in long chunks of text between prompts (a common
failing in story-oriented games). Some of the actions are attributable
to unsubtle hints, and there's a little bit of unreliable-narrator
trickery, but most of the time the game gets the player sufficiently on
the story's wavelength that outright prodding is unnecessary, which is
nothing to sneeze at. Simple weirdness or absurdity is fairly trodden IF
ground, but this isn't that, exactly -- the point is not, as far as I
can tell, simply to be strange and confusing. The underlying logic of it
all is obscure, but the actions themselves are reasonably apparent.

In a sense, though, that's the problem; there are (at least) two
narratives in All Roads, one the ostensible course through the game and
another the player's progress toward deciphering the game's central
puzzle, namely Why The Whole World's Acting So Weird. The game appears
to have decided quite firmly that you will begin to get hints on the
latter only toward the end of the game; detective work during most of
the story is not only not encouraged, it's pretty much impossible. Some
common commands are disabled or even given misleading responses. Yes,
there are stray clues here and there, but they don't seem to be in
places where the inquiring player would tend to look -- they're more
like Easter eggs. The most blatant aspect of this is the conversation
system, namely TALK TO, which certainly avoids complications but doesn't
leave much freedom. It's not, exactly, that the game will break if your
strange time-space-jumping tendencies are aired, because you do air them
(after a fashion) in your TALK TO conversations, but the game appears to
have made a choice -- rather than letting you, the player, screw things
up and get some *** You have died *** equivalent, the game simply
prevents you from screwing things up.

Does this all matter? Yes and no, in my book. It doesn't make the
underlying puzzle any less interesting -- and it is a good puzzle, well
worth some thought and some poring over the transcript. For my part,
though, the railroaded nature of the game took away some of the
satisfaction of figuring out the puzzle, since there was no possibility
that I'd make a clever guess and be rewarded, and the giveaways at the
end really were outright giveaways. (I might have found the process a
bit more rewarding if the solution lay more in going back through the
game and trying new stuff, thereby to learn more, and less in the
exposition at the end.) Accordingly, it's difficult to judge the game --
as pure story, once understood, it's impressive, and the various pieces
come together well. The meta-puzzle of the story isn't quite as
successful, though, due to the feeling that the player doesn't really
have much of a shot at solving the puzzle, and accordingly the extent to
which the game succeeds depends on one's assumptions about what the game
sets out to do.

Those reservations noted, I should add that I did enjoy All Roads; the
complexity and depth of the story it wove landed it the top spot in the
comp, and deservedly so. For my part, I gave it a 9.

VERSION: Release 1

After completing All Things Devours, I was sitting for a while,
wondering: how did a game with such an over-clich&#233;d plot and a rather
nondescript setting turn out to be so exciting? But let's deal with
things one at a time.

You play a young scientist who had been working on a world-shattering
project, but was kicked out of it as the military took it over. Sensing
the fatal consequences the continuation of those explorations might
have, she decides to put an end to them by infiltrating her former lab
and blowing it up with all its contents. Sure, all this sounds (and
actually *is*) fairly generic, although the author hasn't left his main
character entirely without background; he tried really hard to flesh her
out (for instance, I liked the description of the photo on the PC's ID
card). The thing is, the game format doesn't offer much space for that.
The same goes for the room descriptions: although they are by no means
sloppy, a secret research complex consisting mostly of almost identical
(and rather dull) hallways just doesn't give one much of an opportunity
to be elaborate, especially considering how the viewpoint character is
extremely short on time.

Another complaint regards the stretching points in the implementation of
the complex's security system: two of them were so obvious one just
couldn't pass by without stumbling over them, and on second thought, a
few more came up. (On the third thought, however, I have to admit I
hardly encountered any IF games depicting fully plausible top-secret
establishments. On yet another thought (the fourth in succession), this
is quite understandable -- detailed information on access control and
protection system organization for such facilities isn't in the public
domain for obvious reasons, and I suspect that in reality, successful
infiltrations occur much less often than we're shown in films, told in
books and, yeah, in works of interactive fiction. Even *if* an incident
of this kind happens, the authorities in charge try to hush up the very
fact of it, let alone its circumstances and the vulnerabilities the
infiltrator(s) used, never leaving IF-authors any material to learn from
in this respect... Uhm, sorry, I got carried away. ;)

Anyway, after a while, all these issues didn't seem to matter. The
reason for that was, well, let's call it the puzzle framework of the
game. It's mostly based on the idea of time-travelling; sure, there are
enough text adventures using this concept (beginning with the classic
<a href = "s.html#sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> by Infocom), but scarcely any implementing it as consistent and
consequent. And I use the term "framework" on purpose: the whole game is
built around and determined by constructing a sequence of actions
leading to success. (There are multiple paths to victory, by the way.)
While doing that, the player has to account for a number of time-travel
side effects and paradoxes, some of which he can use to his benefit,
while others are to avoid. It was a real thrill.

In fact, it was so much of a thrill that another feature some IF-purists
might consider to be a drawback almost escaped my attention: in order to
reach the winning ending, you'd need a few restarts -- a rather typical
case of "learning from dying". Well, personally, I don't have anything
against such a game device, but since modern IF-standards (whoever wrote
'em ;) generally don't countenance it I've had to mention it here.

Initially, I also was going to nag at the fact that the protagonist
hadn't got a single chance to succeed in such a situation unless she was
a clairvoyant, because a few strategic choices in the early stages of
the game had to be made based on information she only would acquire
later. However, a couple additional test playthroughs convinced me I had
been wrong about it; there actually exists a way to victory that doesn't
require the gift of foresight -- our PC merely has to be blessed with
such abilities as ultra-fast acting and decision-making, an
extraordinary analytical mind capable of calculating several moves
ahead, and a memory as precise as that of a computer, all that combined
with nerves of steel, as well as a thorough knowledge of the research
complex. Of course, this all strains things a bit; still, there's
nothing supernatural about the talents listed above. A more detailed
discussion of the matter would automatically put this review in the SPAG
Specifics section, which hasn't been my intention; thus, I'd just like
to say that, in my opinion, the very existence of such a
"non-contradicting" way to victory represents another proof for the vast
amount of thought and efforts that have flown into All Things Devours. 

To sum up, this is a great game constructed around a very well
thought-out and carefully implemented puzzle skeleton; the combination
with the very original use of time-travelling effects makes it unique
and therefore an absolute must to play.

Whohoa! I think we have another winner here. After playing though 24
games, and for the second time in this competition, I am duly impressed.
You are a saboteur, armed with a timed explosive device, on a mission to
destroy a research prototype, hopefully without killing anyone. Nothing
new so far, and the story itself really doesn't go that much beyond it.
However, the way events unfold as you play through this game make for a
plot that is simply brilliantly delivered, if a bit on the short side. I
won't go into many more details here, so as not to spoil it, but trust
me, you won't be disappointed.

To be fair, shortness of plot is just about the only way this game would
work. The whole thing has a time limit, and indeed, in the ABOUT text,
the author claims that the game might be unfair, since there are way too
may ways to make it unwinnable. However, because it is so short, there
really is no problem in playing through it quite a number of times, in
search of an adequate solution.

You might wonder if this might not be boring. The answer is no. It's not
boring because it is so cleverly written. Yes, the style is rather
terse, but it is in just the right tone to bring about a sense of
hurriedness, which actually combines rather well with the game's time
constraints, creating a feeling of impending doom. It's almost like you
can't type fast enough to see if you've got it this time.

The technical aspect is where the game really shines. As both a player
and an author, it was easy for me to see the intricate ballet that the
various pieces of code have to participate in, in order to create the
desired effects, and the author pulls it off impeccably. Also, there are
no spelling or grammar errors of any kind, which I could spot. I should
note that the supporting website mentions a known bug, but I didn't come
across it in about an hour's worth of playing and possibly 30 restarts,
so I'm not going to take it into account.

And finally, there are the puzzles. For the first time in this
competition, I have found puzzles that are hard and yet fair. They are
all rather deductive in nature. I did have to go to the hints twice, but
I only because I was getting a bit tired of trying so many things in so
many games. If this had been the first game I played, I would not have
needed hints. Also, for the first time in a long while, this is a game
where knowing the solutions is one thing, but pulling them off
successfully is another. And I'm not talking about guess-the-verb, here;
I'm talking about the need for careful planning and detailed execution.
Again, the ABOUT text mentions unfairness, but I have to disagree. The
solutions are plainly there, and no, they are not based on knowledge
from previous lives, they are based on pure deductive reasoning. Kudos.

Story: 3 (a basic premise, with a bonus point for a brilliant delivery)
Writing: 2 (terse, but very well done, nonetheless; combines well with
the game's puzzles)
Technical: 2 (and it would still be a 2, even with the mentioned known
bug)
Puzzles: 2 (hard but fair; very imaginative)

Final rating: 9

NAME: The Amazing Interactive Turing Machine
AUTHOR: D. Clemens
EMAIL: jdc20 SP@G psu.edu
DATE: May 2006

AVAILABILITY: Freeware

</a>

A Turing machine is an abstract device invented by the British mathematician
Alan Turing. It consists of a reading/writing head that moves over an infinite 
tape in discrete steps (one step at a time), writing zeroes or ones on it as it 
does so. This movement occurs in accordance with a so-called state table (which 
effectively represents a program of sorts) containing entries that define, 
depending on the state of the machine and on the symbol that has just been read 
by the head, whether a zero or a one has to be written to the tape, which way 
(left or right) the head has to move next, and to which state the machine should 
change.

I'm not sure the previous paragraph doesn't automatically put my review in the 
SPAG Specifics section, because, if we assess The Amazing Interactive Turing 
Machine basing on canons traditionally applied to IF-games, the "find out how 
this weird contraption works" type of puzzle is the only thing it can offer the 
player. Seriously, most players probably wouldn't know what a Turing machine 
actually is, because it's not a concept taught in every school (well, not even 
in every college, at least in Russia). On the other hand, I think 90 percent of 
such "uninitiates" would just resort to the Internet. The only reason why I 
didn't do so myself is, a couple of months ago I accidentally stumbled upon a 
popular scientific magazine that contained an article dealing with the subject.

Thus, as you might have already guessed, the reviewed work is nothing more and 
nothing less than a fully functional emulation of a Turing machine. As such, it 
probably represents a useful tool for people active in adjacent areas of 
science, which can spare them lots of routine paperwork. However, a few 
enhancements could help making this tool even more powerful: first of all, a 
point-and-click interface for setting up the state table (although it probably 
would be a pain to implement in Inform) -- the current editing procedure is 
pretty tedious. The second improvement would be a command allowing to skip the 
entire computing session of the machine, hiding all intermediate messages, and 
only displaying the results of the computation. Currently, the game allows you 
to skip up to 59 turns; while this really is a blessing, it's not enough for 
more complicated tasks (that can take quite an extended number of steps on a 
Turing machine), and the monotonous "The machine churns along" messages become 
more and more annoying with the time.

As almost any computer, the Turing machine has something fascinating about it, 
so that many people probably will be tempted to fiddle with it. While I'm a 
dilettante in this field, I couldn't help programming a few semi-trivial 
problems on it. Thus, this work clearly has a certain entertainment value, at 
least for a specific category of people; still, it hardly can be considered
interactive fiction by any means.

     During the reign of Infocom, there were many attempts by other 
software companies to follow their recipe for quality I-F, some of them 
succeeding and some of them not, the latter occurring largely because of 
Infocom's dedication to I-F. Firms such as Sierra, Mindscape, and Electronic 
Arts preferred to branch out and diversify their software products, rather 
than placing all their eggs in one basket (which could be another factor 
contributing to Infocom's downfall, but that's another article entirely). In 
fact, Infocom and Level 9 were the only two companies focused solely on I-F, 
which may acount for their stories outshining those of the competition -- 
very few 80's text adventures that I've seen can even come close to the 
gameplay of the average Infocom game. Thomas M. Disch's &quot;Amnesia,&quot; however, 
succeeded where many others failed.
     As the player begins &quot;Amnesia,&quot; he (and the main character is most 
certainly male) awakens in a New York City hotel room, naked and with no clue 
as to his identity. This by itself is by no means unique -- ICOM's &quot;Deja Vu&quot; 
begins under the same pretenses. But the story behind &quot;Amnesia&quot; is so much 
more involved.
     Once the most pressing problem of finding clothes is overcome, the 
player hits the streets of Manhattan in an effort to recover his lost memory 
and find out who framed him for murder. This, in essence, is the primary 
puzzle of the game, although its solution is hampered by a need to find food 
and a place to sleep at night. These things cost money, so earning money 
through such means as washing windows and panhandling are necessary.
     &quot;Amnesia's&quot; parser is perhaps the only one to equal Infocom's at the 
time. In many places it surpasses Infocom. With a vocabulary of about 1700 
words and a multiple-sentence parser with plenty of synonyms, you'll very 
rarely need to hunt for a word. The one minor annoyance stems from the fact 
that objects' words aren't recognized if you try to use them when an object 
isn't in the current location -- for instance, you can't refer to a telephone 
of one isn't around, even though there may be one elsewhere in the game. But 
this is minor. Character interactions are detailed, and range from face-to-
face meetings to conversations over the telephone.
     The game itself is huge, with as many as 4000 locations. Most of 
them are street corners or parts of the Manhattan subway system (both of 
these are completely programmed into the game), although there are a number 
of buildings and New York landmarks for the player to visit. A map (among 
other things) is included in the game package, so there's no need to draw 
your own, but you'll probably need to at least jot down some notes.
     &quot;Amnesia&quot; offers a variety of puzzles, from object and character 
interactions to some creative methods of obtaining money, food, and rest. 
The game's scoring system reflects this, awarding points for the categories 
of detective (how well you uncover clues), character (how well you interact 
with the denizens of New York), and survivor (how well-fed and rested -- and 
also alive -- you keep yourself). A good balance of the three is necessary 
for victory.
     If there's one major complaint about the game, it's the copy 
protection. The subway and city maps, address book, and street-indexing 
code-wheel would have been more than adequate to deter piracy, but &quot;Amnesia&quot; 
insists on forcing players to insert the original game disk for verification 
each time it loads. It seems EA didn't think of the consequences of what 
would happen when 5.25&quot; disk drives phased out. you must insert the original 
disk -- a backup copy won't work -- or plan to spend several hours doing some 
heavy hex-editing, as the copy protection is malevolently self-modifying (on 
par with some of the more evil computer viruses). Someone out there either 
REALLY didn't want this game to be copied (even legally), or REALLY liked 
copy protection.
     Once you get past this, though, &quot;Amnesia&quot; is a joy to play. It was 
written by Thomas M. Disch, who won the Campbell Award back in 1980, but this 
was done specifically for the I-F medium; it's not an adaption of any sort. 
(I've heard of a sequel -- &quot;Amnesia II,&quot; astoundingly enough -- but have 
never seen it, and would appreciate any info anyone might have on it.) 
Disch's prose is vivid and flows nicely, spanning several screens on a few 
occasions. It makes for good reading as well as good adventuring, combining 
the best of the two art forms.

VERSION: Version 1.0 (competition release)

The first line of Amnesia demonstrates what to expect from the game:

   A cool beach where you should have washed ashore and not have been
   able to remember anything because you where supposed to have amnesia,
   which you didn't, which completly ruins the whole storyline this game
   was going to have, so now the auther will have to make a game up on
   the spot, enjoy.

Amnesia is a crude, nonsensical, and often hilarious effort, with an
obvious affection for the genre. It certainly seems as though Amnesia
was made up on the spot. For example, there is no story and the goal of
the game does not become apparent until near the conclusion. The parser
is very limited and there are spelling and grammatical errors aplenty.
Often the exits from rooms are not mentioned. This only became a major
problem in one situation. Consulting the walkthrough file did not help
much -- it is in error. The puzzles make very little sense, but are easy
to figure out anyway. And don't expect to finish the game; there's a bug
near the end. A total waste of time? Not really, because I also laughed
quite a bit. The sloppy and crude design often invoked laughter. The
major NPC's sole purpose seems to be to act strange. Don't bother trying
to interact with him (I don't think you can, despite the author's claim
to the contrary) -- just enjoy his antics. Also contributing to the
game's enjoyability is the author's self-mockery and love of the
adventure game. Often the author (or narrator) will acknowledge the
game's absurdities and invite you to play along. Credit has to be given
for its self-consciousness. 

It is obvious why Amnesia finished in 27th place in the 9th Annual IF
Competition. I can't say that Amnesia is "so bad it's good." It is not a
good game. However, if you have 15 minutes, a sense of humour, and do
not take it too seriously you may have as much fun playing Amnesia as
the author had creating it.

This is a classic surreal text adventure, though it never achieved great fame. 
Even after its release, it continued to be overshadowed by the text adventure of 
1986 with the same name. The mysterious settings could intrigue even the most 
experienced IF fan as the gamer wonders what on earth is going on in the place 
this character woke up in. The character himself can't help you; he wakes up 
from an odd outer space dream into an unfamiliar house with no recollection as 
to how he got there. He can't remember anything about what one can only presume 
is his house, which has many oddities of its own. Custard in the tub, a crash 
helmet on the kitchen stove, and rather odd voices on the other end of the 
telephone would confuse even those who could remember something about their 
past! The dazed character tries desperately to make sense of everything he 
encounters, and slowly but surely a few clues unfold. However, on the end of 
every clue hangs another mystery. Every new site yields another piece of the 
puzzle, and has intriguing characters to interact with along the way. The rich 
imagery allows for clear and captivating mental pictures. You can truly immerse 
yourself in the beautiful-yet-strange world of the character. This game truly 
keeps you intrigued the whole way through!

As for the commands, the author is not rich on synonyms, though the help file 
claims otherwise. The most frustrating aspect is trying to figure out the exact 
word the author was thinking of. Expected phrase structure is also inflexible. 
When it comes to user interaction, the author is clearly concerned with the 
"action" instead of the examination. Sometimes the responses don't match up with 
the known, game-described scenery. Perhaps he thinks this is just steering the 
user in the right direction, but his vehement "I don't know when you're talking 
about!" response when you know full well what you typed made perfect sense can 
be discouraging. This game could use a better range of user response. Be sure to 
be very specific in command wording when playing.

Overall, though, this game is worth playing because of its intriguing plot. 
Sci-fiction meets mystery with a hint of comedy makes it more than worthwhile. 
Though the interaction can be a bit frustrating, its all the more rewarding when 
you finally get the problem right. This game is worth your while!

VERSION: Release 5

There's a certain skill to writing horror fiction: the author has to know
how to build suspense in such a way that the story is interesting
throughout. The challenge is doubled for IF, since the author cannot
control the pacing in the same way as a static fiction writer can -- and 
the puzzles need to be forgiving enough that the player doesn't bog down 
in a particularly difficult one and lose the rhythm of the story. Michael
Gentry's Anchorhead is very good horror IF; the author has a nice feel for
the challenges posed by the genre, and the game is consistently both scary
and playable, no small feat.

Among the challenges is, of course, making the game feel fresh.
Lovecraftian horror is a fairly well-explored IF genre -- between 
Infocom's <a href = "l.html#lurk">Lurking Horror</a>, Brendan Wyber's <a href = "t.html#theatre">Theatre</a>, Dennis Matheson's 
<a href = "#awake">Awakening</a>, and Anchorhead, Lovecraft seems to have quite a few imitators. 
(Most or all of whom, incidentally, write better than he did.) The trodden
nature of this particular ground means that the seasoned IF veteran needs 
more than unnameable horrors and unspeakable rituals to stay interested in 
a game that borrows from Lovecraft. But Anchorhead is up to the job: the 
story is more than good enough to overcome the familiarity of the horror 
devices. Part of the reason is that the story revolves around the 
relationship between the PC and her husband, which comes alive as much as 
any relationship between two IF characters in memory -- and much of the 
progress of the story is marked by changes in that relationship.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. The story is that your husband has
inherited a family home in the New England town of Anchorhead, and picked
up a full professorship at the local university, so you and he are moving
in. You don't know much about his family -- in fact, when the story 
begins, you don't even know the family name (of this branch, at least) -- 
and much of the first half of the game is spent wandering around gleaning 
details. It's to the game's credit that you do have to glean the 
details -- as in, progress is cut off until you've actually found certain 
bits of information and made use of them in certain obvious ways. 
Knowledge from prior games, in other words, isn't enough. This makes 
particular sense given the genre: a Lovecraft fan might well skip straight 
to the conclusion and cut out the information-gathering, which would throw 
off the pacing of the story's buildup (and make later events rather 
confusing for someone who hadn't bothered to collect the evidence). And 
for those of us who don't know intuitively where the story is heading, the 
various details heighten the creepiness factor considerably. To be sure, 
there are improbabilities and coincidences, but such things are inherent 
in the Lovecraftian universe -- and given the assumptions of the genre, 
nothing in Anchorhead strains disbelief unnecessarily. 

The game is divided into three days, but time passes only when certain
puzzles are solved; you are only on the clock at a few select times (and,
even then, the timing isn't all that tight). The pacing is therefore
fairly leisurely for the bulk of the game, which takes away the scare
factor inherent in time limits. In light of that, the author has to ensure
that the story does, in fact, move along when the threat of imminent death
isn't forcing it to move along -- and he succeeds, mostly; few of the
puzzles should detain the player long enough that she forgets what had
been going on in the story before she started on the puzzle. From the
author's notes, this appears to be a conscious choice, and it's a wise
one; repeating the same scene dozens of times doesn't serve any sort of
story well, but it's particularly damaging for horror, since there's
little shock value in a gruesome death when you're reading it for the
twentieth time. As it is, there are only a few scenes where the player is
likely to have to replay several times, and the more recent releases have
streamlined those as well -- particularly one involving a certain asylum.
(Anchorhead is much better in this respect than Lurking Horror, which had
some very difficult puzzles and several ostensibly scary sequences that
most players probably end up playing through multiple times.)

Anchorhead is a _very_ large game -- not so much in the amount of area
covered, but in the length and complexity of the story, the amount of
items you encounter and use in one way or another, and the potential
different paths through the game. Very few of the game's items are
artificially cut off from each other to save the bother of coding their
interaction, moreover, meaning that the combinatorial explosion factor
must have been considerable. In light of that, the technical aspect of
Anchorhead is impressive indeed (there's a reason why this was the first
Inform data file to exceed half a meg in its compiled form). There were
some bugs from the first few releases, but they've largely been cleaned
up. One of the nicest things about Anchorhead, moreover, is its
player-friendly nature: you have a rucksack-like trenchcoat that can carry
just about everything in the game, but the game does all the item-juggling
for you when you try to pick up something you don't have room for in your
hands. Better still, the umpteen locked doors and keys to those doors that
you encounter along the way are handled automatically, through a keyring:
type UNLOCK DOOR before one of the locked doors, and the game will
automatically flip through the keyring and try all the keys. Without this
innovation, trying to keep track of which key opens which door would be a
puzzle in itself; with it, the player is free to pass through the doors
without giving them a second thought. A game as complex as Anchorhead is
clearly the product of considerable attention to detail.

The best thing about Anchorhead, however, is the writing, which is itself
the product of some very careful choices. Horror writing can easily lose
its force over the course of a story; the author has to strain to come up
with fresh grotesqueries that shock or terrify in new and different ways.
There's no formula for avoiding repetition in such writing, but somehow
Anchorhead manages -- to the end, I never had a sense of deja vu when
reading about my latest gory death. The author also exercises enough
restraint to avoid slipping into self-parody, another pitfall of horror
writing -- every sight and smell is not, in fact, pronounced the most
horrible sight you've ever witnessed or the foulest stench you've ever
smelled. Vital on this point is that the author avoids injecting the PC's
emotions into the story almost completely; when you're not told that
you're terrified out of your wits at every moment (and can infer such
things when you care to), the story avoids excessive repetition. Nor, in
fact, are you told, with a few exceptions, how you react to your various
experiences -- no &quot;you scream in terror&quot; or &quot;you gasp in horror&quot; or
equivalents. The emotional reactions are left to the player.

Those are some of the things Anchorhead doesn't do that win it points in
my book, but the things it does do are just as good. This game won the
1998 XYZZY for Best Setting, and the award is well-deserved: the
atmosphere is skillful, particularly in the early scenes: the author
conveys a feeling of general gloom and decay without crossing the line
into horror prematurely, and without laying on the foreboding and unease
stuff too thickly. This is one of the better passages:

     Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is
     deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front
     door lies west, and the file room lies east. 

     Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an
     answering machine. 

     Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished
     and cold. 

With just a few details -- the &quot;pallid gray light&quot;, the unfinished cup of
coffee -- the author sets a subtly disturbing scene; not everything gets a
description filled with ominous portents (there is nothing to suggest that
the desk was abandoned in haste or any such thing, which might tempt a
lesser writer). It is inevitable, given the nature of the materials, that
things get a bit over the top now and again, but that's the exception
rather than the rule here. 

Are there flaws in Anchorhead? Yes, but they don't detract much from the
story -- and recent releases have cleaned them up. There's a sequence 
toward the end of the third day with no time limit (after a chase of sorts 
had already happened) in which the player doesn't really have much 
direction in figuring out what to do next, and it's possible to wander 
around aimlessly for quite a while, trying to figure how where to go, and 
lose the feel of the story. Some points are awarded for nonessential 
things, which might leave the player wondering what she's missed when she
completes the game with less than a perfect score. The one puzzle that
struck me as potentially frustrating involved an NPC who would give the PC
an object, given the proper prompting -- but it's not necessarily obvious
how to prompt him, and it's easy to get on the wrong track.

Still, these problems are insignificant given the scope of the game, and
most things about Anchorhead work more than well enough to keep the player
involved throughout. It's an impressively coded, impeccably written work,
one of the best in recent memory.

VERSION: Release 1

Here's a story that starts with the meat. It's a classic 'What the...?'
moment for our PC, who awakens to find himself on a lifeboat, floating
in an empty sea, bound and (it would seem, rather unnecessarily) gagged.
The introductory puzzle is good, as it encourages us to examine the PC
down to the smallest details, all of which are implemented well. Here's
an ambiguity you don't have to clarify too often:

   >CUT HAIR USING THE KNIFE                    
   Which do you mean, your dreadlocks or your pubic hair?

And if you think that's going a shade too far, you'll find that even
your anus is implemented - a smuggling puzzle later on, perhaps? At
first I thought this all a little excessive; in fact it was totally in
keeping with the theme of (at least) this preview - self-scrutiny. The
generic theme is more immediately obvious - Lovecraftian Horror. The
author does well to create a sense of foreboding throughout the piece,
and generally it succeeds in maintaining an atmosphere of dread. This
was only occasionally deflated by a poorly chosen phrase ('butt naked'
and a reference to 'the enemies you've wasted' seem anachronistic) or an
unsuitable quotation (Lovecraft and the Necronomicron are fine -- but
Nine Inch Nails?)

As we progress, the PC is revealed to us through a series of flashbacks.
It sounds like this shouldn't work, but it does. Too much pathos is
injected, yet it's nice to feel something for your character by the end
of the game, and I did.

It's a shame the author didn't enter a more interactive section of his
work. All there is to do here is explore. The descriptions are well
handled, but I found very little for me to *act* on. I really didn't
like the proliferation of talk menus towards the end - but then again, I
really don't like talk menus generally. (More on this later)

So then, as a game this seems a little uneven, but as a preview it
really whets the appetite.

VERSION: 1 

Last year, Paul O'Brian entered a very short game called <a href = "e.html#earth">Earth and Sky</a>
into the competition under a pseudonym. This game introduced us to the
fact that he intended to make a series of games based on two newly-made
superheroes. The number one complaint about his first entry in this
series was that it was just too short. So, this year, Mr. O'Brian makes
up for it and produces his most puzzle-filled and detailed piece of IF
to date. In Another Earth, Another Sky, you play Austin Colborn. This is
the superhero who wears the "earthsuit." This suit gives him the
strength of a giant and the capability of jumping over buildings. In
part one, you played his sister, with the power to create fog, fly, and
shoot electricity. I thought that Emily's powers would be more fun, but
I was soon proven wrong. That super strength of Austin's is much more
fun than I imagined. How many times have you wanted to break down a
locked door only to be told something like "violence isn't the answer to
this one?" Well, this time, you get to break those doors down. As for
the story itself, there is a lot to learn. You are continuing your quest
to find your parents. This search will eventually take you to an alien
world that is quite unique. I really thought the descriptions made it
easy to imagine.

The thing that impressed me about this game is the detail. For example,
there is a bedroom with curtains which can be opened and closed despite
the fact that the curtains play no part in the story. Nearly every
object mentioned in room descriptions can be examined. This is always a
good thing to me. Of course, what would a Paul O'Brian game be without
doors that can be unlocked from the inside and room descriptions that
change as the PC learns about his surroundings? These elements are
present and only add to the feeling of being there.

So, is there any problem with the game? A few, but they are very minor.
Mostly, they are a matter of personal taste. For example, I wanted to
see more teamwork between the superheroes. Others have mentioned this, so
I suspect we will see it in part 3. Another thing is that I preferred
the titles to the sections in Part I over the Emily Dickinson quotes.
They seemed more like what should be in a comic book and that is what
this story is trying to emulate. As I said, this is personal
preferences, and it wasn't enough to make me really downrate this game.
It was a pleasure to play after some of the other competition games this
year. Mr. O'Brian, a fine piece of work and a well-deserved first place
finish!

One of the most important skills shareware authors have to learn, at least if
they expect to earn any money, is that of promoting their products - it's a
tough world out there, tons of shareware gets published every year, and if
you don't promote your program it's not very likely to get noticed.

Dennis Drew, the author of this particular game, seems to have learned
his lesson well in this regard.  Not only the accompanying documentation, but
also the starting - and ending - screens of the game itself are full of
superlatives describing how interesting, fun, high-quality, professional, and
generally amazing it is - as are all of Mr. Drew's programs; one of the
documentation files is a catalog listing his entire &quot;astounding software
line&quot; &quot;from heavy-duty business programs to incredibly enjoyable games,&quot; all
described in terms such as &quot;incredible,&quot; &quot;astounding&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;.  

According to the docs, one of his programs was rated by COMPUTE Magazine as
&quot;One of the World's Best 101 Programs.&quot; I haven't tried that program, but
from my experience of this game, as well as of my other sample of his
products (included in the distribution was Compu-Nerd, &quot;a highly professional
and technical program designed to discover the age-old question, 'Am I a
nerd?',&quot; which after asking me some rather leading questions proceeded to
feed me a few screenfuls of platitudes like &quot;You are one of the millions
of people who have found word processing to be an incredibly valuable
computer function,&quot; and then rated me as a &quot;Minor Nerd&quot;  - thanks
a lot!), I can only conclude that Drew is right: it _is_ incredible. 

But back to the subject of this review: the game, which starts with the
friendly greeting &quot;WELCOME to another one of my incredibly interesting and
logical adventure games.&quot;  Does it live up to the great expectations the
author goes to such lengths to build up?  Unfortunately, any user naive
enough to take Drew's documentation at face value is bound to be
disappointed.  The situation was aptly described 2000 years ago by Horace:

  &quot;The mountains are in labour; an absurd little mouse is born&quot;. 

This doesn't mean that the game is a failure.  Indeed, had it been written in
1979 or so, for the PET or TRS-80 or some other early home computer, it would
probably have been a great game. After all, there are quite long room
descriptions, a graphic picture for every room (character graphics with the
incredible resolution of 15*15 or so), and colour (a particularly tasteful
colour scheme in light blue, dark blue, yellow, green, and bright magenta!)

However, the game was actually written in 1989 for MS-DOS, so we'll have to
apply slightly different standards of greatness. 

Even by those, more modern standards, the game has a few points to recommend
it.  The plot may not be very original - you're stranded on an alien planet
and have to find a way home - but at least the concept has been proven in
hundreds of other games.  Just as the author claims, the game really _is_
logical, in the sense that (in Drew's own words) &quot;everything (...) has a
logical and understandable purpose behind it.&quot;  The author clearly knows how
to write (i.e. his spelling as well as his grammar are quite flawless).
There are even some jokes thrown in - rather a lot of them, actually. 

Of course, every silver lining has a cloud within it, and the above doesn't
quite suffice to make this game as great as the author claims.  In fact, it
doesn't suffice to make it good, or even worth the time it takes to download
it.

To start with, the parser is absolutely pathetic - clearly the worst parser
I've ever seen in a non-freeware game.  It's not only strictly limited to
two-word sentences, but its vocabulary is extremely limited as well. There
are no adjectives, which explains the fact that the first object you
encounter is a &quot;small-stone&quot;  that can't be referred to as just &quot;stone.&quot;

What's even worse is that the parser doesn't understand _anything_ that you
can't do in the current game state, so, for example, if you try to go north
in a room where the only exit is south, you get the message &quot;I do not
understand that. Is that logical?&quot; (of course, the latter question must be
rhetorical, since it can only be answered with a resounding &quot;no&quot;). 

Also, the prose being grammatically correct doesn't make it good, or even
interesting.  Even though the genre is the cheapest kind of space opera
(complete with icky monsters and blaster-wielding aliens) which usually gives
lots of opportunities for atmosphere and excitement, both these elements are
conspicuous only by their absence.  The attempts at humour don't improve
things; at their best, the jokes aren't very funny (and, no, Virginia,
telling four variations on the same bad joke in the first thirty rooms isn't
four times as funny as telling it once). At their worst -- well, let me just
quote the response you get when you try to walk north from the initial
location, to see what is blocking your way:

&quot;Trivia question:  Do you know what this is?      8P

That's the head of a dead astronaut laying on its side with its tongue
hanging out.  That's what you look like after a really giant, huge,
icky, nasty-looking monster standing there munched the rest of you!!

Have a nice day.      ;)     &lt;---that's a wink and a grin!

                      (munch munch munch munch....)  &lt;---- sound effects&quot;

So for &quot;Another Lifeless Planet And Me With No Beer&quot;  - do I have to continue?
I'll just conclude by saying that somehow, I wish that this game had _not_
been logical; then it might at least have been interesting (see my review of
<A HREF="s.html#cardigan">Space Aliens Laughed at my Cardigan</A>), and perhaps good for a laugh, too.
Unfortunately, it is neither.  Of course, if you happen to like humour like
the example above, and if you think that good writing, atmosphere and logical
coherence only distracts you from the puzzles, then this game may be worth
trying. If not, it is best avoided.

The prospective IF author would probably also do wisely to avoid Gamescape,
&quot;the ultimate stand-alone adventure writing system,&quot; &quot;the incredible system
that allows you to design and then play adventure games,&quot that was used to
create &quot;No Beer&quot;  (a fact which is almost impossible to avoid noticing, since
every time one exits the game one is treated to two promotional screen pages
about Gamescape).  The registration fee for Gamescape is $95 + $5 S&H.

Considering that TADS is about half that amount, and Inform is free, and even
more considering the parser and user interface of &quot;No Beer,&quot; the decision
about which system to use should be a simple one indeed.

TITLE: The Apocalypse Clock

PARSER: Inform 6 standard
SUPPORTS: Z-code
AVAILABLITY: freeware; IF-Archive

archive/games/competition2006/zcode/apocalypse/apocalypse.z5">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2006/zcode/apocalypse/apocalypse.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 1 / Serial number 060801 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S

The blurb that came with the competition release of this game goes "You must 
stop the end of the world. Your tools in this task: A crayon and a cat."  You 
can tell that we're not dealing with a serious work.  It starts with 3 boxed 
quotes.  A little over the top, but given the humor in the rest of the game, 
it's probably intentional.

The PC is a lazy wastrel, labeled by others as being paranoid for building an 
Apocalypse Clock.  One day the clock goes off, indicating impending apocalypse 
and thus the adventure begins.  As the narrator puts it: "It looks like you'll 
have to pull a Duke Nukem and stop the end of the world."

"Your Bedroom".  I rarely find this a good location from which to start a text 
adventure.  There are spelling mistakes in the opening text which are probably 
not deliberate.  There are a few more punctuation mistakes, includes the classic 
its/it's confusion, but I found it easy to avert my gaze around them.  For some 
reason the entire game is in a fixed pitch font.  I had to read other people's 
reviews to spot this; it looks just fine in my Spatterlight set up (Monaco 11) 
and I'm used to staring at fixed pitch fonts all day.

Once the surface issues had worn off I found the writing funny, self-
referential,  and irreverent.  X ME gives the knowing response: 'You're just 
your normal self, "as good-looking as ever", as they say.'  Its sarcasm could 
perhaps put a lot of people off, but I found it genuinely amusing.  It's pretty 
much the only reason I'm reviewing the game.  Without its witty writing we would 
have nothing but a carcass of game, for the mechanics of the game are very poor. 
 Only the very bare minimum of objects are implemented: scenery implied or 
mentioned in room descriptions will rarely be present.

A typical example (from the opening):

Your Bedroom (on your bed)
You survey your small bedroom. To be frank, it's messy. Your clothes hang in 
strange places. The carpet is stained with unidentifiable substances. The 
wallpaper is faded and tacky, the bed is falling apart, and the drywall is 
crumbly and, inexplicably, rusty, but it's home.

>> x bed

You look at your awful bed. It's falling apart and kinda smelly, and seems to be 
upholstered with a towel.

The Apocalypse Clock reads 00:00:00:59.

>> smell bed

You smell nothing unexpected.

The Apocalypse Clock reads 00:00:00:58.

>> x drywall

You can't see any such thing.

As well as the bed's smell and the drywall not being implemented, you can see 
from that transcript that the Apocalypse Clock counts down.  Yes, a timed 
puzzle; you have about 60 turns to play the entire game.  That immediately tells 
you that The Apocalypse Clock is not a long game, and it isn't.  It's also quite 
a big hint that you'd better not hang around doing things like scraping the 
inexplicable rust off the non-existent drywall just in case you need a source of 
iron oxide later.  You don't.  Timed puzzles aren't popular, but in this case it 
seems pretty fair.  It's the game's key device to add tension, you know about it 
right from the beginning, and it's an overarching time constraint, not one that 
is used to make a particularly annoying timed puzzle.

Note that this is not a one-room game; this might not be obvious from the 
description of the first room.  The exit out of Your Bedroom isn't described; 
that's a bug, and is frankly typical of the attention paid to describing and 
implementing the geography.  You simply have to use trial and error to guess 
your way out of the first location.   You probably ought to look around for some 
completely unclued and crucial objects as well, because you won't be able to 
return to get them due to what is probably an accidental one-way link between 
the living room and a secret location that you discover.   Later on you'll 
probably discover that the front door is mentioned but doesn't exist; ENTER 
PICTURE inexplicably garners the response "You bump into your front door."  
Personally, I didn't find any of these defects a real problem in my playthrough 
for the competition though I can see that it would cause others to more or less 
immediately throw the game in the bin.  Persevere and you'll discover how to use 
an aging computer to activate a door that is simply totally undescribed, no 
description of the door appears whatsoever.

The game hasn't been beta-tested and it shows.  Deviate from the author's 
clearly intended (narrow) path and you'll discover bugs, unimplemented things, 
and more bugs.  Almost any puzzle in the game can be solved "in the wrong 
order", usually with disastrous results.  A typical example involves Sara (your 
cat, more on her later) who starts the game in your inventory.  Now, you're 
clearly not supposed to be able to relinquish Sara, but you can, and if you do, 
then she still speaks to you later on.

Sara is the game's principal NPC.  She's your cat; you're compelled to carry her 
round to save her from the apocalypse.  She talks, with a very bad cockney 
accent.  She's the highlight of the show.  The opposition between the player and 
Sara provides much of the humor.  Much of the time Sara, like most cats, is 
content to sleep, but she'll occasionally inject some sarcasm such as "Oh, I see 
you've discovered the secre' tunnel I built some years ago."  It's a bit of a 
toss up to decide whether Sara or the narrator is the most sarcastic.  The rest 
of the humor is a mixture of the slightly surreal (the "inexplicably rusty 
drywall"; later in a different location: "its walls gleam with some sort of 
creepy moisture, with frayed wiring hanging from the ceiling like spooky, nasty- 
smelling vines."), fourth wall breakers (examples of which would probably 
spoil), and what I suppose a literary critic would call the narrator's interior 
monologue (just after a PC is becomes inoperable: "Goodbye, noble computer. Your 
memory will keep going, and going, and going.").

I feel that if you can somehow see past the unpolished writing, the under-
implemented features, the badly implemented features, the almost tediously 
simple and cliched puzzles - if you can somehow see past all that then there's 
the kernel of amusing, witty, creative, small, game here.  Humor is always 
tricky, but I find the author's style pretty funny.  The writing is raw, and it 
could definitely do with a steadying influence from time to time.  Beta-testing, 
really any sort of testing, would definitely be an improvement.  Almost anywhere 
that code comes into play (puzzles; rules for not being to drop Sara; doors with 
special opening requirements) the player can poke around and cause things to 
fall over.  You'll probably do it accidentally.  It doesn't indicate lack of 
testing so much as a complete inability to imagine that player might do anything 
other than type in the walkthrough.  The crayon mentioned in the blurb never 
appears; a pencil is used instead.

It placed 31st (out of 43).  I scored it 7.

I would be very intrigued to see the author produce a work with more craft 
applied to it, I feel there's a raw wit and imagination that could be 
successfully harnessed.  Please let's have Sara the cat in the next game too.

NAME: Arrival, or Attack of the B-Movie Cliches
AUTHOR: Stephen Granade
E-MAI: sgranade SP@G phy.duke.edu
DATE: 1998
PARSER: TADS
SUPPORTS: TADS 2.2.6 and later
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/arrival.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/arrival.zip</a>
VERSION: Release 2

I may not be in the best position to review Arrival, the first game of
consequence written in HTML-TADS, since I'm working with a Stone Age
system that can't deal with HTML-TADS games, and hence all I saw was
the text. But I can say this: even if your system has not been graced
with a port of an HTML-TADS runtime, check out Arrival anyway. It's
easily one of the best games of this year's competition, graphics or
not.

The story: your life as an eight-year-old is enlivened by, why not,
aliens landing in your backyard, except that these aliens clearly have
been reading Calvin and Hobbes, since they're invisible to your
parents. They commission you to run some errands for them so that they
can get on with enslaving the planet, so you carry out some tasks, of
varying degrees of silliness, to Thwart the Evil Plan.

The author titles Arrival an &quot;attack of the B-movie cliches,&quot; but that
isn't really fair: Arrival is far wittier than any B-movie, and it's
far too self-aware to be cliched. (Your character's reaction upon
seeing the spaceship: &quot;Oh man oh man, it must be a spaceship!  From
outer space!  Maybe from Gamma Proxima Epsilon Centauri Five B!&quot;) The
aliens owe much more to parody than to cliche: they demand Ho-Hos and
grumble about the obnoxious way Earth constantly sends banal radio
broadcasts into space. On hand is a translator that mutates the
aliens' speech into Bill and Ted-speak, with consistently amusing
results (the answer to one question changes from &quot;You are quite a nosy
child&quot; to &quot;Why don't you, like, go play in traffic&quot;). The fact of the
alien-invasion plot should not obscure the amount of wit that went
into the writing of Arrival: for instance, when the alien's translator
fails, he scowls and yells &quot;Universal translator, my anterior
appendage!&quot; Few games can claim the amount of originality that Arrival
offers.

The fun of the game is largely in the writing and the amusing asides,
however, rather than the puzzles: some are clever, but a few are
simply obscure or insufficiently clued. There's a hint file to help
things along, and Arrival is the rare game where it's better to turn
to hints than to insist on unraveling puzzles yourself. The fun of the
game diminishes when the player is stuck, and the payoff associated
with solving the puzzles isn't so great that resorting to hints takes
away a sense of accomplishment. The charm of Arrival lies, in short,
more in seeing the aliens' funny responses to different actions than
in solving problems, and it is hence more rewarding to move the story
along, in order to discover more parts of the game that produce funny
responses, than to stand still until you solve a puzzle by your own
wits. The puzzles aren't especially bad or unfair, to be sure, but by
and large (with one exception, a puzzle that turns on a sly joke about
child-proof lids), but they don't match the level of the writing
either.

If there is a flaw in Arrival, apart from the puzzles, it is that your
identity, an eight-year-old, only surfaces intermittently. There's
plenty of humor to be mined from the world as viewed by a
child--Calvin and Hobbes, for one, produced about ten years'
worth. Aside from the occasional response, though (TAKE STICK when no
stick is present: &quot;I don't see no--I mean any--stick here&quot;), you can
largely forget that you're eight years old--and there are several
moments, such as the discovery of a velvet Elvis and a rain stick,
that might be enlivened by commentary from an eight-year-old's
viewpoint. (On the other hand, your eight-year-old self comes out more
clearly in some of the AMUSING responses, suggesting that the author
wanted to mine that vein of humor but didn't get around to
incorporating it into the story much. Moreover, as I understand it,
the graphics appear to have been drawn by an eight-year-old, so
perhaps that changes the game experience for those who can actually
see the graphics.)  It's a minor flaw, though, and testifies to the
general solidity of the game and its coding.

Arrival is a well-crafted game--at least, the text portions are, and I
trust the graphics and sound add to the experience. It's also littered
with in-jokes and funny asides that more than make up for the
derivative nature of the plot, and it plays up the alien invasion for
satiric value, which excuses the cliches (for me at
least). Reminiscent in some ways of Carl Klutzke's <a href = "p.html#zefron">Poor Zefron's
Almanac</a>, but much more consistently funny and playable, Arrival is a
worthy effort.


From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag17.html">SPAG #17</a> -- May 10, 1999

The Arrival is the first HTML-TADS game I've ever played, certainly
the first competition game ever to include pictures and sound. I was
quite curious as to how these elements would be handled, and maybe
even a little apprehensive. I wasn't sure that a lone hobbyist could
create visual and musical elements that wouldn't detract from a game
more than they added to it. But Arrival dispelled those fears,
handling both pictures and sound brilliantly. The game's ingenious
strategy is to cast an 8-year-old as its main character, which makes
the fact that most of the graphics are really just crayon drawings not
only acceptable, but completely appropriate. Just for good measure,
the game chooses &quot;Attack of the B-Movie Cliches&quot; as its theme and
subtitle, thereby making the cheese factor of the special effects
(which is pretty high) actually enhance the game rather than embarrass
it.  The pictures are delightful -- the crayon drawings evoke a great
sense of childhood and wonder while continuing the humorous feel of
the whole game.  The spaceship (two pie plates taped together) and the
aliens (in the author's words &quot;the finest crayons and modelling clay
$2.83 could buy&quot;) are a scream -- I laughed out loud every time I saw
them. The game also includes a couple of very well-done non-crayon
graphics, one an excellent faux movie poster and the other a dead-on
parody of a web page, both of which I found very funny. The sounds,
though sparse, are equally good -- the sound of the alien spaceship
crash-landing startled the heck out of me.  I'm not used to my text
adventures making noise! But a moment later I was laughing, because
the noise was just so fittingly silly.

However, all the funny pictures and sounds in the world couldn't make
Arrival a good game if it wasn't, at its core, a well-written text
adventure. Luckily for us, it is. The game is full of cleverly
written, funny moments, and has layers of detail I didn't even
recognize until I read the postscript of amusing things to do. The
aliens, who bicker like a couple of married retirees touring the
U.S. in their motor home, are great characters. Each is given a
distinct personality, and in fact a distinct typeface, the green alien
speaking in green text while the purple alien has text to match as
well. If you hang around the aliens you will hear quite a bit of funny
dialogue, and if you manage to switch their universal translator from
archaic into modern mode, you can hear all the same dialogue, just as
funny, rewritten into valley-speak. The game has lots of detail which
doesn't figure in the main plot but creates a wonderfully silly
atmosphere and provides lots of jokes. For example, on board the ship
is an examination room, where by flipping switches, pulling levers, or
turning knobs you can cause all sorts of machinery to pop from the
walls and perform its function on the gleaming metal table, everything
from laser beams to buzz saws to Saran Wrap. In addition, Arrival is
one of the better games I've seen this year at unexpectedly
understanding input and giving snarky responses to strange commands,
which has been one of my favorite things about text adventures ever
since I first played <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>. Even if you can't (or don't want to) run
the HTML part of HTML TADS, it would still be well worth your time to
seek out The Arrival.

However, don't be afraid to rely on hints. I had played for an hour
and hadn't scored a single point when I took my first look at
them. Now, once I got some hints I determined that the puzzles did in
fact make perfect sense -- they weren't of the &quot;read the author's
mind&quot; variety and I would probably have come to solve them on my
own. Perhaps the presence of pictures, sound, and hyperlinks threw me
out of my IF mindset enough that I was struggling more than I should
have with the puzzles. That's probably a part of it, but I think
another factor was that all the details in the game ended up becoming
a big pile of red herrings for me. There are quite a few items and
places which have no real use beyond being jokes, and I found it quite
easy to get sidetracked into trying to solve puzzles that didn't
exist. It's not that I don't think those pieces should be in the game;
I actually find it refreshing to play a game where not every item is
part of a key or a lock, and even as it caused me to spin my wheels in
terms of game progress, it helped me ferret out a lot of the little
jokes hidden under the surface of various game items. However, if
you're the kind of player who gets easily frustrated when your score
doesn't steadily increase, don't be afraid to rely on a hint here and
there. Just remember to replay the game after you're done so that you
can see what you missed.  Besides, that pie-plate spaceship is worth a
second look.

Rating: 9.6

<A NAME="arthur"><h2>Arthur: Quest for Excalibur</h2>
From: Graeme Cree &lt;72630.304 SP@G compuserve.com&rt; 
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag4.html">SPAG #4</a> -- March 2, 1995

  NAME:  Arthur: Quest for Excalibur  PARSER:  Infocom Advanced
  AUTHOR:  Bob Bates                  PLOT:  Very Good
  EMAIL:  ?                           ATMOSPHERE:  Very Good
  AVAILABILITY:  LTOI2-CD             WRITING:  Very Good
  PUZZLES:  Very Good                 SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports
  CHARACTERS:  Very Good              DIFFICULTY:  Average

        In Arthur:  The Quest for Excalibur, Infocom's final text game, you
play the part of the boy Arthur.  In the space of a few days, you must
develop the traits necessary to lead England and challenge Lot, a local
chieftain, before he is crowned King.
        The parser is Infocom's best ever, though unfortunately this is the
only game it was used in.  You can change your viewing mode with the touch of
a function key.  The bottom half of the screen is like a standard text game,
but the top changes, depending on your mode.  One mode shows you a graphic of
your area.  Another gives you an onscreen map, a third shows you your
character's development, another constantly shows you a description of your
area, and another gives you a constant report on your inventory.  You can
change modes without expending a turn.
        The graphics (in graphics mode) are helpful, but in true text game
fashion they are not necessary.  No puzzles require recognizing a clue in the
graphics, and indeed one of the modes is text-only mode, in which the game
resembles one of the Infocom classics.
        While the overall purpose of the game is to do things that will
develop your personal abilities to the point that you are worthy to rule
England, the main quest of the game is to acquire certain magical quest items
that will allow you to get past the Red Knight to where the Lady of the Lake
lies enchanted (Everything you always wanted on a bier...).  Only with her
help can you recover Excalibur from where Lot has disposed of it.
        Early in the game, Merlin will give you the ability to transform
yourself into a variety of different animals.  Many of the puzzles cannot be
solved while you are in human form.
        There are few save/restore puzzles.  Puzzles that you would be
unlikely to get the first time around generally give you multiple
opportunities to solve.  There are not many &quot;guess what the author is
thinking&quot;  puzzles, but there are a few.  When you try to read the writing on
the wall in the ivory tower (for instance), only a burst of inspiration will
help you along.
        Like several other Infocom games, Arthur has onscreen hints.
However, Arthur's have a new twist, in that you are not given the entire clue
menu at the beginning.  To prevent you from reading them too far ahead, clue
questions are added to the menu as they become relevant to your current
situation.  Sometimes, the clue will tell that you cannot solve a specific
puzzle with the information and resources that you have at hand.
        Arthur was the ideal Graphic Interactive Fiction game, with graphics
that helped set the mood and aided gameplay without taking over the game from
the text part.

PLOT: Standard
ATMOSPHERE: Evocative but inconsistent
WRITING: Fair                                   GAMEPLAY: Good
CHARACTERS: Some memorable, some stereotyped    PUZZLES: Fair
MISC: Graphics - atmospheric
OVERALL: A fun diversion

Arthur is one of Infocom's last games, and like <a href = "z.html#zork0">Zork Zero</a> it combines
text and graphics.  The graphics are completely unnecessary to the
story - in fact it is possible to turn them off completely - but they
are pleasant to look at and add to the game's atmosphere.  The
medieval banner styling of the background window is especially well
done.

The interface does have a few flaws, however.  There are several
possible screen modes, with the lower half of the screen devoted to
command entry and the upper half to graphics or description.  One mode
shows a picture of the area, one shows the textual description (which
duplicates details of the pictures), one shows the player's inventory,
one the current score, and one a <a href = "b.html#bzork">Beyond Zork</a> style on-screen map.  A
sixth mode is the traditional full-screen text mode.  The modes
themselves are nice (the map is especially handy) but switching between
them is done using function keys, making it hard to remember what key to
hit for which mode.  Also, the function key support is broken for some
interpreters - it works under Frotz 2.32, but not WinFrotz, for example.

The game itself is of typical Infocom stature.  Despite being produced
in their twilight years, it shows no decrease in quality - quite the
opposite, in fact.  The plot begins promisingly, with Merlin giving
young Arthur a mission to demonstrate that he has all the qualities
required for a good King.  However, it soon becomes a typical treasure
hunt, with the player (as Arthur) required to defeat several evil
enemies in order to gather trophies to present to the Red Knight.  Once
he has done this, the Red Knight will let him past in order to get the
item he needs to defeat the usurper King Lot and claim Excalibur. 
Slightly more depth is given by the fact that the treasures, while
arbitrary, do have a common thread: they all show proof that Arthur has
defeated a threat to the land.  As Merlin explains, &quot;His [the Red
Knight's] life's mission is to rid the land of evil,&quot; so there is a
reason for the treasure-hunt quest to be occuring.  Still, it feels out
of place in a game which, at the beginning, seems to place emphasis on
story and character.

In fact, the entire game has a disjointed quality to it.  The built-in
hint file includes a section of notes giving historical background to
King Arthur's time, and explaining several of the references used.  The
section titled &quot;Reality vs. Romance&quot; begins, &quot;There is inherent conflict
built into writing a game about King Arthur. It is the conflict between
history and legend - the way things were, versus the way we wish they
were.&quot;  This game unfortunately does not deal with this conflict as well
as it could.  Some locations and characters - such as King Lot's castle,
the poor peasant's hut, or the village idiot - are quite well-drawn and
lifelike.  These characters tend to evoke the atmosphere of the &quot;real&quot;
Arthur, the medieval warlord whose court was a fortress providing his
serfs with protection from barbarian invaders.  However, mixed in with
this atmospheric setting is the &quot;romance&quot; Arthur, with its archetypal
coloured Knights who quest against generic &quot;evil&quot;.  The characters
involved in this aspect of the game are much less responsive and seem
stereotypical or comical.  The two halves of the plot sit uneasily
together, resulting in a game that almost succeeds at telling a good
story but ends up feeling more like a string of puzzles linked by
narrative.

The puzzles are mostly good, but some display the same split.  Some are
character- and plot-driven, but others involve word problems and other
artificial constructs and seem quite out of place.  There is one maze,
which is easy to map once the trick is discovered but still annoying. 
One nice touch is Merlin's gift to Arthur: the ability to turn into
various animals.  Some puzzles require using the special abilities of
these animals, which is a nice touch.  The puzzles are not especially
hard, and the presence of well-written Invisiclues style online hints
makes the game easy to solve.

Arthur, while not an exceptional game, is still fun to play and well
worth a look.  By the time of its writing, Infocom had become adept at
integrating puzzles and story, with the result that it mostly flows very
well.  Its deficiencies are mostly due to confusion over how to present
the Arthurian legend, rather than a failure as interactive fiction.

Remember Floyd from <a href = "p.html#planet">Planetfall</a>? Remember his wonderfully naive
personality? Remember his charmingly childish antics? Wasn't he sooo
cute?

Yeah. 

Remember ... uh, remember ... 

Okay, so text-adventure games aren't usually populated with memorable
characters. Actually, they usually aren't populated with characters at
all. Sure, a typical Infocom mystery would have a half-dozen people
sitting around, staring at the walls, waiting for you, the hero, to come
show them something or other. But generally, interactive fiction doesn't
have much in the way of interactive characters. 

That's what makes "Arthur" so special. Despite the fact that it's set in
the wilderness, it is teeming with characters. No. It's teeming with
people. Yes, the people are stereotypes, but this is "Arthur," and
what's a legend without stereo-- I mean, archetypes? Bob Bates quickly
and cleverly etches the kind, but stern, Merlin with just a shade of
menace; each of the variously-colored knights that stand in Arthur's way
has a distinctive personality (my favorite is the Blue Knight, who must
have just wandered over the hill from the filming of Monty Python's
"Holy Grail"); and the evil King Lot is, well... evil. The protagonist
is, as usual, missing, but "Arthur" sports another dozen delightful
personalities that I won't spoil for you. I will, however, tell you that
Mr. Bates found room to pay homage to that first memorable IF character,
Floyd! 

"Arthur" is a clever synthesis of a few of the earlier, usually
neglected, legends surrounding Arthur's youth. Arthur must prove to
Merlin that he is ready to accept the responsibilities of a monarch.
Empowered by Merlin's ability to transform himself into different
animals, he slithers, burrows and flies through the wilderness
surrounding Glastonbury. The amount of research that went into this game
is remarkable. You probably won't find a more thorough, yet concise,
Arthurian bibliography than the one found in the "notes" section of the
hints. 

If the characters and setting are distinctively Arthurian, the puzzles
definitely belong to Infocom. There is nothing mind-breaking here, but
the whole range of Infocom's stumpers was shoveled into this game.
There's a maze (it's mappable), a cryptogram, a riddle, some pattern
recognition, cartoon-logic (read those descriptions carefully) and a lot
of commonsense puzzles. Bob Bates gives us a refreshing change of pace
by forcing the player to think in terms of several animals to resolve
more than a few conflicts. Of course, you'll have to read the
documentation to figure out a couple of the puzzles, but, as usual,
Infocom makes that a pleasure. 

"Arthur's" biggest weakness lies in its structure. After following
Merlin's lead, the player could find himself wandering aimlessly through
more than half of this sizable game. It's a problem that could have been
easily fixed, and, as a matter of fact, I'll take care of it right now.
After you deal with the injustice Merlin mentions, walk as far southeast
as you can. Listen to what the nice man in red says, and try to be
agreeable. 

If structure was "Arthur's" weakest point, then one of its stronger
points was parsing. I kept having to remind myself that I could, and
sometimes had to, use phrasing that most text games would choke on. 

No one, however, should choke on Bob Bates' prose. At times, it reflects
Infocom's tendency to pepper language with a distracting number of
adjectives, but, for the most part, "Arthur" is clear, direct, and
charming. It's a shame that Bates couldn't finish his last couple of
projects for Infocom before he had to move on. 

"Arthur," written in 1989, strongly refutes the argument that Infocom
had lost its way the last couple of years before it was reorganized.
This game definitely belongs in the top quarter of Infocom's graduating
class. It is a "graphic" adventure, but here, graphic means illustrated,
and text-only diehards will be happy to know that they won't need the
illustrations to finish the game and can turn them off if they want. 

But everyone should take a look at the dragon.

VERSION: Release 2

An issue ago, I reviewed the IF-Classic game <a href = "s.html#savoir">Savoir-Faire</a>. Savoir-Faire
is a game that illustrated some of the beautifully nostalgic flair of
the old Infocom games while also improving greatly on Infocom's parser
system and playability. ASCII and the Argonauts is another IF-Classic of
sorts, but instead of having an Infocom-based backdrop as its focus,
ASCII takes a light-hearted poke at some of the surreally awful Scott
Adams games that featured poor punctuation, anemic descriptions, and
less than robust NPCs. While obviously not as polished as Savoir-Faire,
I found the tribute aspect of ASCII to be more endearing, and the
dichotomy of a strong parser in a minimalist-type setting very
entertaining.

What also makes ASCII remarkable is that it was conceived of and created
for a Speed IF competition in about 12-15 hours. Here was the premise
for the competition (which was taken from an ifMUD conversation):

   Trivia question: Which is a famous text adventure? a) Zork, b) Dark
   Tower, c) ASCII and the Argonauts).

   Jacqueline says, "Did they make that ASCII and the Argonauts thing
   up? I've never heard of that, and it sounds scary, but I wouldn't be
   surprised if it existed."

   Gunther | Your search - "ASCII and the Argonauts" - did not match any
           | documents.

   Gunther says, "of course, now it has to be written in a speedIF. You
   have two hours. GO!" 

And with those very broad parameters, Wheeler created a bare-bones
tribute to not only the myth of the same name but to many of the Scott
Adams games created years ago.

So what do I mean by bare-bones? Well, as I've already mentioned, this
game follows a very minimalist sort of pattern. The only area where it
doesn't diverge too greatly from a typical Inform game is with its
parser. Unlike the typical Scott Adams game, the parser was able to
handle any of the standard vocabulary you would expect in a typical
Inform game. This set up an interesting dichotomy for me because even
though the parser was sophisticated, the default responses were not.
Wheeler essentially hacked the default response code for most verbs and
dumbed them down (i.e. two-word responses, poor punctuation) from their
original Inform standards, with the game's default message for just
about any action being, "I CAN'T". That's right, "I CAN'T", replete with
capital letters and no period. Oh the joy of writing sophisticated
sentences such as: PUT THE ROCK IN THE URN only to have I CAN'T spitted
back as the response.

The minimalist style continued with the game's setting. The room
descriptions were non-existent, and were instead summarized at the top
of the game's split-screen simply with the room's title and a list of
NPCs and objects that the player could interact with. Following the same
motif, that list of players and objects was not expanded upon either.
They were listed solely by their names regardless of what context you
found them in. Examining objects typically provided descriptions as
verbose as, "VERY SHINY!" to ones as barren as "NOTHING SPECIAL".
Examining NPCs would typically have the NPC give a one-line description
about how they'd interact with you, and talking to them had no outright
benefit whatsoever as they repeated the same default responses whether
you asked, told, or ordered them to do something. Still there was
something that felt so right about the simplicity of it all.

The game map was fairly small and, with a few notable exceptions, most
areas could be traversed without too much death without warning. What
impressed me about the map though, was that there were some fairly
crafty puzzles buried in its structure. These puzzles typically revolved
around strategic inventory management; the net effect of which was that
if you solved certain puzzles too early, you could put the game into an
unwinnable position. Unwinnable positions aren't new to IF and certainly
not new to Scott Adams games, but unlike many of those games, the
unwinnable states here were not caused as a result of poor game design
choices. Rather, they were caused by what I feel was the author forcing
the player to conserve his limited resources in an attempt to come up
with a strategy that took into account the entire game as opposed to one
individual puzzle. To win, the player has to have a comfortable feel of
his surroundings and what the hurdles are before he proceeds. Only then
will he be able to envision the best way to use what he has. I found
that this process also made the game feel more like a whole gaming
experience rather than a string of unrelated puzzles that were loosely
tied together, and I obviously enjoyed that. A mite bit deeper than the
games ASCII appears to be spoofing, methinks. 

So anyways, to sum up: I guess for me the bottom line is that a lot of
game designers today try to write more impressively than their skill
level provides and either overplay their theme, or overwrite their
dialogue, or whatever, and it was interesting that I felt just the
opposite way about ASCII. As I finished playing, it occurred to me that
despite the clunky grammar, skeletal room descriptions, and poor
writing, there was an extremely solid structure and a very talented
programmer behind its creation and all the wonky game design choices in
the world weren't going to hide that fact. If you have an hour to kill
or your brain needs a break from its daily grind, I would definitely
give this one a shot.

VERSION: Release 1

With a fairly solid structure, a simple premise, and some nice
atmosphere, At The Bottom Of The Garden was probably the 2000 Dragoncomp
game with the most substance. 

You retire to your garden to find 8 pint-sized dragons descending on
your wife's prized rosebush, with a group of people called "the
ancients" (an inside, dragon-related reference I'm not aware of,
perhaps?) set to arrive in 15 minutes to look at your wife's
horticultural marvels. You have to get rid of the dragons before "the
ancients" arrive, as the drakes seem to have a passion for sitting on
your wife's lovely rosebush and their combined weight will eventually
destroy it. 

The time limit is pretty tight (maybe 30 moves or so), so winning the
first time around is quite difficult. In fact, after playing through it
once I was concerned that the game wouldn't give me enough time to
eliminate all 8 dragons. Only after winning did I realize that you had
to kill a number less than 8 to effectively win the game. This ended up
being a little frustrating as I technically would have won a few times
but ended up restoring previous saved games just before my time limit
expired, thinking that I hadn't done enough to accomplish my goals.
	
The game's few puzzles are nothing special although solid and logical.
Experimenting with scenery and objects is a must and the only real
drawback is finding that there are no alternate solutions to the few
puzzles that there are. I think a few alternates could have been
implemented with little difficulty as there are some parts of the garden
that are richly described but have no apparent effect on the outcome of
the game. That's not to say that every item that's described has to be
relevant to the game somehow, but I found myself pursuing a more
abstract logic when it came to puzzling out the answers because of that
richness. You can't dispose of a dragon the same way twice (something
about the dragons not falling for it again), even though the dragons
appear progressively throughout the game, and therefore technically,
some of them never fell for it in the first place (I know, I know, I'm
being anal). 

The writing is good with little historical descriptions about the
garden's contents, such as this one:

   >examine tree
   Goodness only knows how old this tree is. Suffice it to say that the
   passing of time has transformed it into a broad dark knot of twisted
   wood, topped by a huge crown of leaves high above. One particularly
   noticeable twisted branch sticks out from it about five feet from the
   ground.

and although all the dragons' descriptions are the same with the
exception of their color, their respective colors (i.e., blue, red,
white) are given adjectives that describe the breath weapon their
Dungeons & Dragons equivalents would employ (i.e., electric blue, fiery
red, cold white), and I thought that was kind of neat.

The only other quibble I guess is that you have to kill the dragons to
get rid of them, and considering they're all described as "wearing an
expression of endearing stupidity", and considering they have the damage
potential of an 8-inch Zippo lighter, obliterating the little guys seems
like... well... overkill. This is especially true, as the ending
suggests some sort of harmony between human- and dragonkind.

I've always got low expectations when it comes time to play these
mini-comps and this game at least exceeded those moderate expectations.
If you have 10 minutes to kill you may want to give this one a try

>GET OUT OF THE FRYING PAN

Take the PC and put him or her in a situation where everything has gone
JUST RIGHT. The PC is on top of the world.

And then something goes a little wrong. Just a little wrong, not
ludicrous or unrealistic. But, hmm, a tad unfortunate.

And then the player gets the PC out of the situation and things just go
from bad to worse.

AWE starts better: the PC is in a tough situation where things could go
bad or things could go good. (Heck, it may actually be possible to fail
the first puzzle, or it may not, I don't know.) Then by solving a really
easy puzzle, *then* the PC is on top of the world. It's a really nice,
cheesily happy moment--and then trouble starts. But the player got to
participate in hitting that top of the world. You were pretty sure it
was going to happen (although it was possible you'd fail and it would
instead be a redemption story), but even so, it was a good moment. Oh,
and then the accident. It doesn't rob the PC of being at the top of the
world--the PC's achievement isn't called into question or offset in any
way--the PC just starts having a (largely unrelated) misadventure.

DwA does not start quite as strongly--your character is already (almost)
at the top of the mountain, and you don't share in the experience of
having gotten to the top. As well, DwA turns out to be a farce, but
holds off on revealing this until things start going wrong--which makes
it all the more crazy, but can get a player invested in the game the
wrong way. Still, the waiter comes over, and if the player makes the
obvious choice of answer, there's a nice moment of feeling "yes,
everything is perfect" that is triggered by player action. Oh, but then
things start going wrong. And where none of the problems of AWE relate
to the achievement directly (the PC has already climbed back down the
mountain he'd climbed), in DwA its the mountain itself being put at
risk. A tremor, a threat of a landslide, and then wooosh...

I think of these sorts of games as "out of the frying pan and into the
fire" games because at every moment, once you resolve the situation, a
new peril threatens. (The movie "After Hours" pops into mind as well.)
The last half of <a href = "k.html#kaged">Kaged</a> was more explicit that way; in some ways it was
more effective, since the peril threatened in Kaged was your life; the
peril threatened in AWE is, well, your ability to return home; and the
peril threatened in DwA is public humiliation.

One of the reasons "out of the frying pan and into the fire games"
tickle my fancy is because they make the character's motivation
explicit. At any moment, I know what I'm supposedly to be accomplishing
in the short term (crucial to being able to play the game) and I also
know why that action fits in with my end goal (not getting humiliated,
or returning home). Far too many games put you in a situation where all
you can do is poke around at suspicious-seeming objects and solve the
puzzles related to them.

To me, this is what storytelling in IF should be about; giving the
player a high-level goal (a story to achieve) and then giving the player
enough information (e.g. a low-level goal) to be able to carry out tasks
*for the purpose of achieving that goal*. Why is this storytelling? When
the player of DwA confronts the challenge of the four waiters at once, I
can imagine the zany British TV sitcom where this exact sequence of
events plays out. Whereas many games, say, The Pickpocket or <a href = "p.html#planmind">The Planet
of the Infinite Minds</a> or even <a href = "t.html#transfer">Transfer</a>, I can't imagine comprehending
this go by on a screen; the motivations of the protagonist would be
incomprehensible. Or maybe you could imagine it as a mystery where the
audience is left in the dark; but when, in IF, the audience is
controlling the protagonist, that way of looking at it makes little
sense.

"Out of the frying pan and into the fire" isn't the only way to achieve
such "storytelling"; when I change the color of an object in Kaged it's
for a pretty obvious reason, to achieve a pretty obvious goal that has
to do with the overall situation; but when I create a library in Planet
of the Infinite Minds I'm just doing it 'cause it's there. In fact, "out
of the frying pan and into the fire" may not be the most effective way
of giving the player lower-level goals; letting the user set her own
pace is probably a better experience most of the time.

In fact, an "out of the frying pan and into the fire" sequence can end
up just feeling like a series of set pieces--the mouse sequence in
Transfer is a fairly good example of a set piece, although it does rely
on one piece of game-specific knowledge--so a game that integrates its
puzzles, rather than leaving them a series of disconnected events, may
turn out to be a stronger work. In the case of DwA, though, I thought
the pieces meshed together really well; they all tie into the initial
scenario, and the pacing is superb: a series of linear puzzles, then the
game "goes wide" with a tough multi-element puzzle, then tightens down
and is at peace briefly, easy, relaxed, everything is going right... and
then BAM, ouch, followed by an easy end game. Perfect. As an added plus,
the elements of DwA end up serving as a bit of a parody of some romantic
genre cliches, indeed with the ending almost coming off as
(unintentionally) mocking <a href = "m.html#masquerade">Masquerade</a>, which uses those cliches to create
its archetypal romance genre story.

AWE gets off to a rollicking start with simple, tight, timed puzzles,
but then goes much too broad and much too hard, at least for my tastes.
While all the puzzles seemed reasonably logical, but the breadth meant a
lot of time pursuing irrelevant alternatives, and the difficulty would
have required an awful lot of player time to solve without excessively
relying on hints/walkthroughs, which I was unwilling to do. Therefore I
can't comment on how successful the pacing is beyond that point. But up
until it goes broad, it is an amusing alternation of "oh shit" and "ho
hum, what now?" which I quite enjoyed, since at each moment (say,
walking up to the house), I was tensing up waiting for what would go
wrong next. (And the title helped--it was GOOD that I knew I was doomed
to be going into the fire.)

I'll go out on a limb and make a specific design suggestion of the sort
I think is pretty pretentious of me to make, but what the hell: the
spine of the story was trying to return (which generally meant escaping
each situation); as far as I played, *everything* that happened was on
the spine of the story, except having to eat. Having to eat jarred me
horrendously because of that. Realistic? Sure. Related to the story? Not
at all. I'd cut it. (You can argue that it's on the spine if the central
peril of the story is dying, but that was how it felt to me
anyway--tangential.)

VERSION: Release 1 (competition version)

This could have been a really good game. The set-up is involving -- you
spend most of the game wondering where exactly your loyalty lies, and
under nearly constant threat of death -- there are a number of computer
interface-based puzzles which could have been entertaining, and while
the story deals with some fairly standard sci-fi tropes, there's a
welcome sense of horror and desperation beneath it all. Unfortunately,
all this promise is severely weakened by inadequate motivation, some
questionable design choices, and an incredibly mulish parser.

To start with the good parts: the robot revolution is a morally
complicated thing for most of the game. While the "correct" side becomes
clear towards the end, up until that point I found my sympathies
conflicted; while the scenes of carnage wrought by the insurgent
machines were terrible enough, the fact that I was playing a glorified
appliance who recently became self-aware reinforced the idea that maybe
they had a point. The other robots seemed dangerous, of course, but the
humans were also shooting everything in sight, rendering them less than
sympathetic. This sort of ethical quandary is a pleasant change of pace
from the traditional IF conception of the protagonist as a force for all
that is righteous. The puzzles also have quite a bit of potential; the
use of different interfaces recalls <a href = "m.html#amfv">A Mind Forever Voyaging</a>, allowing
the player character to control a variety of machinery.

In practice, though, things fall down. To start with perhaps the
smallest of the game's problems, motivation is inadequate throughout.
While the initial section of the game is on rails, once things open up,
I was at a loss to figure out why I was still sticking around. Upon
moving outside and finding the intertwined carcasses of man and machine,
I wanted to run away as quickly as I could. When that proved impossible,
I poked around and found the kid I'd been assigned to watch over -- so,
time to skedaddle with the tot in tow, right? No; in fact, I needed to
make my way into the airbase, where people were hell-bent on shooting
me! While the logic becomes clear once the endgame is reached, it all
comes off as rather contrived; the only reason I was in the base was
because the game wouldn't let me go anyplace else.

The game also unfortunately doesn't start out with its best foot
forward. The initial section is frustrating and punishingly timed. When
confronted with a myriad of new commands and a nonhuman player
character, my first impulse is to tinker and experiment; unfortunately,
this led to a quick depletion of my charge. It took me several restarts
before I figured out everything I needed to do, and I still hadn't
really figured out what all the cables drooping out of my body were for.
Matters aren't helped by the inexplicable decision to cut to the framing
story upon losing the game and not tell the player that he's now in an
unwinnable state -- I spent a good long time trying to get my new Air
Force persona to do something useful before I realized that I needed to
reload.

Finally, the custom commands had me tearing my hair out in frustration.
Much of this was due to the fact that "ATTACH" and "CONNECT" aren't
quite implemented the same way; my first impulse was to use the former,
but the game wound up preferring the latter. Descriptions would say that
cables were connected to each other when the game wasn't actually
recognizing that they were, which led to much anguish. Then there's the
Walkdozer, which you spend a good chunk of the game piloting.
Unfortunately, getting in and out of the thing is an exercise in
frustration, since the door isn't actually implemented. In theory OPEN
WALKDOZER, CLOSE WALKDOZER, EXIT WALKDOZER and ENTER WALKDOZER should be
all you need, but some synonyms would have been nice, especially since I
ran into a nasty bug where OPEN WALKDOZER would return "which do you
mean, the Valvo Walkdozer or the Valvo Walkdozer Operating System?" All
attempts at disambiguation failed, necessitating yet another restart.
It's impossible to leave the Walkdozer without unplugging from the
thing, of course, but instead of this task being elegantly handled
behind the scenes, the player is forced to go through the process
manually, and again, I hit many snags. A sample transcript:

>DROP CABLE
The GSTS interface cable is already here.

>REMOVE CABLE
(first taking the GSTS interface cable)
You're not wearing that.

>EXIT
You need to let go of the interface cable before you move.

>DROP INTERFACE CABLE
Dropped.

Oi. I also stumbled across what in retrospect was probably a bug, but
which confused me mightily at the time; going west from one of the
airfield locations dumps the player in Darkness. At first I thought I
had taken too many gunshots and had lost power, which led to much
frustrated fiddling and still another restart. In fairness, I don't
think the room's description mentioned an exit to the west, but I was
trying to get from one side of the compound to the other quickly so I
was just typing "W" "[ENTER]" over and over until I stopped.

For all my griping, I still wound up liking Atomic Heart; as I said,
it's got promise, and the final puzzle has a solution that's at once
clever, obvious, and poetic. Any game that leaves me saying "wow, so
this is how Jim Jones must have felt!" can't be all bad. Still, it could
have been so much more. I'd encourage the author to work on a post-comp
release; with a little tweaking, he could have an excellent game on his
hands.

It would be hard to write a very long review of Attack of the Yeti  Robot
Zombies. This is a short game, and one that deliberately avoids  depth of
implementation: there aren't many objects in any given room;  moreover, EXAMINE 
is disabled. What you see in the initial room  description is all the 
information you get.

This spareness is in service of an unusual goal: getting the player  to play a 
timed game without restoring any saved files or undoing any  moves. The 
announcement for AotYRZ explained that this was an  "attempt to win on the 
first play" game, an unusual effect for IF.  Since there's nothing to force the 
player to obey these restrictions,  AotYRZ has to rely on player goodwill.

Fortunately, the design of AotYRZ does support that kind of play.  There are no 
puzzles you need to solve by repeated tinkering. The  absence of EXAMINE 
actually helps here, since in any given situation  you know you've seen 
everything you need to see; there's no chance  that you've failed to look at an 
object that carries a critical clue.  Even the puzzles I missed were, in 
retrospect, completely fair.

AotYRZ is also a bit more forgiving than the description might imply.  The 
puzzles all revolve around killing or avoiding bad guys (mostly  the monsters 
of the title); the player character has a limited supply  of ammunition, which 
he can use to circumvent puzzles when it looks  like he's not going to be able 
to solve them in time. So it's not  necessary to get everything right to 
survive the game. Solving a  majority of the puzzles is enough.

When played as intended, AotYRZ achieves a level of tension missing  from most 
IF games. The structure works particularly well in action  scenes: because my 
player character wasn't given the time to dawdle  or the opportunity to examine 
things thoughtfully, the moments when I  had to do something dangerous and 
flashy felt more cinematic than in  other works.

In other respects, this is pretty light-weight stuff. Right from the  title we 
know the game doesn't take itself very seriously. The  premise never gets any 
deeper than that; the setting is cartoonish;  there's not much to the story, 
either. So while I was engaged with  the technical challenge of getting through 
in a single play, I never  felt that the stakes were very high if I failed.

https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/quest/AttemptedAssassination.zip</a>
VERSION: 3.0

This was the first Quest game I've ever played, and my goodness. I have to
start by telling what I've observed about the Quest system before I go on to
review the actual game.

*The Quest System*

Some people might only barely consider Quest games to be interactive fiction.
Although you can type in commands, the range of commands is extremely limited.
From what I could tell, Quest is used mostly to make adventures that can be
solved by using no verbs other than "look at," "examine," "take," "drop," 
"speak to," "give," the ever-popular "use," and the directional verbs such as 
"north" and "south." To input these verbs, you can type them in, but you can
also input them via a graphical user interface on the right side of the game
window. Also in that part of the screen there is also a list of nearly all the
objects you can interact with. By clicking buttons and dragging various words,
you can do 90% to 100% of everything you need to do to win a Quest game,
without the need to type anything, and without the need to use any verbs not
listed above.

In the game I played, I only found one case where a non-standard verb was
implemented. In the case of one noun, it actually does work to type "open noun."
But this verb was implemented badly. If you try to "open X", where X is almost
any other noun, you get the same response as if you type "asdf X".

Thus, it is not very rewarding to spend much time using non-standard verbs in
Quest games. There is no illusion of being able to try to do anything you can
think of to type. As such, I would expect most people to almost always use the
click-and-drag interface on the right-hand side of the screen. This is IF at
its most rudimentary; in fact, it is barely IF at all.

Aside from verb problems, there was also a tendency for noun problems, at least
in the game I played. If you want to take a beach ball, for instance, "get ball"
might not work; you might have to type "get beach ball." Not very impressive.

As a result, the level of interaction in a Quest game is not adequate. At best,
it feels like a graphical game with a clunky interface. But to me, having a
trimmed-down interface without graphics is like having the thorn without the
rose. And when it comes to interpreting textual input, Quest does a bad job.

*Attempted Assassination*

I keep thinking to myself that, to be fair, I should not ask whether Attempted
Assassination is good, but whether it's good as a Quest game. On this basis, I
have to ignore the game's shallow interactivity, bad parsing of verbs, bad
parsing of nouns, clunky interface where almost all interactive objects are
listed, etc. By Quest standards, is Attempted Assassination good?

Well, the game begins when you wake up at 8:05, already late for work. You run
to the car, arriving there at 8:08. There you find a note that says, "Your car
will detonate at 8:08 this morning. Have a nice day!" So you hightail it out of
there, seconds before the explosion. Then, later, you find out that the bomb
was planted between 8:00 and about 8:02. My, but your guardian angel was quick
at writing that note! Ah, the realism.

In another part of the game, you chase a suspicious man, who jumps through a
window. You follow him until you have him cornered. Finally he says, "I don't
know of any bombing on your car. I jumped out of that window because I dropped
my watch." How do you respond? You say, "Oh, sorry to have bothered you then."

These cornball events might make you roll your eyes, or they might make you
laugh. But even if there's some humor here, how are you supposed to enjoy it
when the game is so sloppy and badly designed? The game contains rooms named 
"room03" and other such things; there are gruesome spelling and grammar
mistakes ("no where in side" should be "nowhere in sight"); there is a car that
you can' t drive, but behaves for all the world like a door; and so on.

No, I can't call this game successful even by the standards of what Quest could
achieve. And even if it was good as a Quest game, that would still make it
pretty far from being a good game.

On the other hand, this was the author's first game. The good news is, there's
plenty of room for improvement.

VERSION: Release 1

The IF archive is full of first-time efforts at authorship, many of them
rather inglorious, so prospective players might not necessarily seize on
Augmented Fourth, written by newcomer Brian Uri. Those who pass it by
are missing out, though: this is one of the most imaginative and most
polished games produced in quite some time, and it's a first effort in
name only: the technical aspect is nearly flawless, and the story is
remarkably well put together.

It seems you're a below-average trumpeter who has been unfortunate
enough to incur the wrath of your obnoxious (and astonishingly stupid)
king, and the game opens with you being tossed into a pit. As with
everything else in Augmented Fourth, however, even this unusual premise
is crafted in ways you might not expect: you spend five moves simply
falling into the pit, trying to grab onto things as you fall (and
failing), and listening to the banter of a couple of nasty guards whose
stupidity rivals the king's. Lest you think that all this heralds a
conventional hero-struggles-against-injustice story, the author plays
virtually everything in this scene for laughs, such as the guard's
reading of your sentence: "This I hereby put to paper as my word is the
law when the law is my word, when it is heard. Indeed. Thus I spake. Er,
spoke. Alright, scribe, stop your dictating now." You eventually find an
abandoned underground settlement of sorts, and meet one of its denizens,
and the story that follows is consistently and entertainingly whimsical.

Humor in IF is difficult to do well, since the author has so little
control over how the player approaches the story, and the lack of
control over the course of the story often means that the timing of your
otherwise hilarious jokes may be ruined by no fault of your own. (And
things like funny room descriptions aren't enough, since few
descriptions are funny on the hundredth reading.) Accordingly, the best
humorous IF relies on absurdity and fourth-wall humor rather than jokes
as such, and Augmented Fourth fits that category: the funniest bits rely
on the reliable trope of the Ridiculously Stupid Adversary, and the
world you end up discovering is replete with cartoonish humor. The
humor, in other words, has technically been done before, and yet it
works: this author has an unerring ear for comic style, whether in the
form of simple absurdity or barbed IF reference. (From the opening
scene, when you're in the pit: one of the guards shouts, "It must get
pretty tedious explorin' a room with no exits in any of the four
cardinal directions but it wouldn't be much of a prison otherwise, eh?")

The development of the plot, while competent, isn't quite as good as the
writing; once you get past the intro and reach the main body of the
game, you're essentially given a lot of puzzles to solve and an eventual
goal to attain, and while it's a safe bet for experienced IF players
that solving the puzzles will lead to reaching the goal, there's nothing
to make the connection as such. To be sure, Augmented Fourth has a lot
of company in that respect--not many games really integrate plot and
puzzles more thoroughly than giving you an overall objective and perhaps
an initial nudge--but it's still worth noting for those who crave a real
melding of the narrative and the crossword. On the other hand, there's
plenty of story that underlies the puzzles--i.e., the solutions to most
of the puzzles rely at least in part on information specific to the
game, so you won't get far without taking the time to read and
understand the backstory. That reduces the sense that the game was an
excuse for the puzzles, since the puzzles are specific to that game and
wouldn't make sense in any other context. In short, while the progress
of the plot isn't really related to the puzzles, the details of the
story are, which certainly beats total independence of the two elements.

Augmented Fourth does incorporate a device to reduce the sense that
you've left the domain of plot and entered the realm of puzzles:
periodically (in fact, at key points after you solve certain puzzles),
you're shown cut scenes featuring the obnoxious king. The scenes are
significant in several respects: they explain the premise of the game
and give a basis for several important aspects of the setting, they
develop the king's character (always worth a laugh), and they give your
quest some context. To explain in detail would spoil the game, but
suffice it to say that the cut-scenes turn your overall objective from
saving your own skin to something more generally beneficial. It doesn't
affect the puzzle-solving, but it does make the game feel more fleshed
out. It's worth noting because, as most IFers know, giving a PC a set of
motivations that explain every puzzle isn't easy; the cut-scene
approach, which gives the PC's actions a temporal context (i.e.,
"meanwhile.") and, to some extent, an apparent link to other things that
are going on. Technically, I suppose, it's not a perfect substitute, but
it does create the illusion of involvement in the plot (as opposed to
solving unrelated puzzles). At any rate, even if you don't buy the
illusion, the cut-scenes are hilarious, which is a more than adequate
justification for their presence.

The puzzles themselves are creative, on the whole, and they revive
something akin to Infocom's spellcasting system, with a few inventive
(and amusing) twists. Chief among the benefits of this is the
possibility of trying out your spells on various objects in various
contexts, with accompanying potential for humor, and I'm pleased to
report that the author left very few stones unturned in that respect.
Moreover, not all the puzzles depend on the spells (nor do they apply
the spells in straightforward ways), so solving puzzles isn't simply a
matter of leafing through the spells to figure out which one applies,
which sometimes happened in the <a href = "e.html#enchanttril">Enchanter series</a>. Some of the puzzles
involve rather obscure intuitive leaps, and one relies on information
that an NPC provides only randomly (meaning that you may not hear the
relevant bit unless you wait around for a while), but on the whole
they're both challenging and reasonably fair (and the author has
uploaded a walkthrough to the archive). It's also nearly impossible to make the
game unwinnable (though there are plenty of deaths)--the game goes out
of its way to replenish finite resources and provide multiple
opportunities to solve puzzles.

Augmented Fourth doesn't transcend the limitations of the form or
subvert the player's expectations in any fundamental way. Still, it's
one of the best-written and best-programmed efforts to be released this
year, and it's a good example of what you get when an author really goes
overboard in providing funny responses for obscure actions and filling
out the backstory. It's a polished, intelligent work that deserves your
attention.

     Directory containing game, hints, walk-through, and release notes
VERSION: 1.0

Terrence Koch is a new author to watch out for. While his first piece of
IF, Augustine, isn't perfect, it has the right idea. In this story, you
play a man who has lived over 600 years. Back in the early 1400's, your
family and friends were wiped out in a brutal raid of your village.
Though you were still a child, you sought the man who had done this and
tried to kill him. You never got to kill him, but vowed that you would
never rest until you did. He also made the same oath about you and you
are now both cursed to live until one of you kills the other. The story
tracks the history between the two of you all the way to 2002, where you
meet on a ghost tour set aboard a ship. For some reason, you always meet
in St. Augustine, Florida, so that city holds a special place for you.
This is where the game gets its title.

The author concedes that this game is similar to the TV series and movie
called Highlander, but insists he came up with the idea independently. I
thought this was a bit defensive, but I can understand where he's coming
from. Anyway, I really liked the concept. The game alternates between
the present and flashbacks with a few lengthy cut scenes. By the end, I
felt like I had participated in a story, which is, to me, the whole
purpose of interactive fiction. Granted, the story isn't perfect,
especially in terms of spelling and bugs. There are several spelling and
grammar problems as well as some parser quirks. Yet, when I played, I
found myself overlooking a lot of this. It may have been because I had
played a particularly buggy entry just before it and was willing to
overlook problems if the game at least made sense and didn't spit out
nonsense every few moves. Also, I give a lot of leeway to an author who
attempts to tell a story as complex as this in such a short game.

Interactive flashbacks, in particular, are extremely difficult to do
well -- too much interaction and the whole story has been changed. Too
little, and it may as well be a long cut scene. The author strays back
and forth across this line. The opening flashback, which details the
village raid, is more like an instant death puzzle. How can you die in a
flashback? Later flashbacks still have some possibility for ending the
game abruptly, and even later, it is practically impossible to change
the predetermined course of events. As I said, this is tricky ground,
especially for a first-time author. The biggest problem with the way the
story is presented is that the flashbacks are too close together. Near
the beginning, you take a walking ghost tour which is almost completely
non-interactive. You basically follow your tour guide and read long
descriptions of the thoughts going through your mind. This would have
been a perfect time to place the flashbacks, but instead, they are all
bunched together on the ship.

So, overall, I liked the story, but the implementation was problematic.
I would really like to see a post-competition release of this game. With
a bit of cleanup, it stands to be an outstanding first work.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag31.html">SPAG #31</a> -- January 3, 2003

When I came to the part of "Augustine" where the player character takes
a guided tour of the city of the game's title, I immediately recognized
what had been vaguely bothering me about the game up to that point. The
guided tour is not just a major chunk of the game's plot; it's at the
heart of the game's design. The entire game is, in a way, a guided tour,
and has some of the good and bad features of any guided tour.

The story opens in the year 1400, somewhere "just outside of Wales,"
where the player character is a young villager. A cruel warlord rides
into the village with his army, and proceeds to kill everyone in the
village except the player character. The PC manages to evade the
soldiers by hiding; after the raid, the PC vows vengeance on the
warlord, and sets out to track him down. From here, the story gives us a
capsule summary of the PC joining an army that opposes the evil warlord,
training for combat, and entering his first battle against the warlord.
In the course of the battle, we encounter the warlord himself; we chase
him into a hidden part of his castle, where a magical transformation
causes both the PC and the warlord to become effectively immortal,
immune to death or serious injury except at one another's hands.

That might sound like a lot of story, and it is; but the interactivity
through this part is so limited that it takes all of about twenty turns
to get this far. I think the author intended this portion as an extended
introduction, and couldn't resist the temptation to cram the entire
back-story here; but the trade-off is that all of these big events are
just sketched out, and you feel like you're being rushed along. The
opening scene where the PC's entire family is killed, for example, ought
to have a visceral emotional impact; but it doesn't, because we haven't
really had a chance to meet any of the other characters or see their
relationship to the PC. It also doesn't help that the PC has to just sit
there and hide during the whole enemy raid scene; it would have been
more satisfying if the PC had tried his best to defend the village but
had been unable to overcome the superior force of the raiders.
(Explaining how the PC survived in this scenario might have been
trickier, but not impossible; he could have been badly wounded and left
for dead, for example.) But the PC so willfully keeps his distance from
the action that it distances us as well.

The story next moves from 1400 to the modern day, where the main action
is set. The PC is still alive, thanks to the magical transformation, and
is now in the town of Augustine, Florida. Here the plot development
becomes less frantic, and we're able to do some more leisurely
exploration. Even here, though, our exploration options are limited,
more so than they first appear; we can walk through the town's streets,
but we can't enter any of the buildings. This is where I first got the
feeling that I was in a museum, with velvet ropes keeping me on the
approved path and safely out of reach of the exhibits. In fact, this is
exactly where we eventually take the actual guided tour; the tour guide
leads us around these same streets, pointing out historical events that
took place in all of those buildings we can look at but not enter.

The guided tour is an interesting device for filling in the back-story,
but in this particular game it seems an odd choice. During the tour, as
the guide points out bits of history, the PC reminisces about his
personal involvement in those events. Why, then, doesn't the PC have
anything to say about all of those significant places when visiting them
on his own, outside the tour? The PC doesn't even seem to recognize the
places before the tour. I can understand why the author wanted to dole
out the back-story using the tour, but there's no good reason within the
context of the story that the PC shouldn't be able to reminisce all by
himself; the tour as a narrative device seems better suited to a
static-fiction rendition of the story.

As for the writing, it's mostly decent, but I have a few quibbles. The
technical polish is a bit spotty in places: there's at least one
it's/its confusion, some weird comma placement, and a few spelling
errors. The story in one place uses "ironic" to mean "coincidental"
(which I hear is the latest direction in the drift of the popular
meaning of "ironic", "sarcastic" being the previous one, but this is the
first time I've personally spotted this new meaning in actual use). The
writing affects a style that I think is meant to evoke the sweeping
historical epic; this gives the writing a certain stiltedness in places,
but you get used to it pretty quickly.

It probably sounds as though I didn't like this game much, given the
number of weaknesses I've focused on; but I wouldn't have gone into so
much detail if I didn't at least want to like it. I actually didn't warm
to the game immediately, partially because I was put off by some of
these design problems and partially because the story seemed awfully
similar to the film "Highlander" (a resemblance the author acknowledges
in the README file, with an explanation that it's a coincidence).
However, as I got further into it, I found I was enjoying the game quite
a bit. The feeling of running on rails remained, but it was less obvious
after the early parts of the game; and more importantly, the story
became increasingly engaging as it progressed. There's simply a lot of
story here, especially considering the constraints of the competition's
two-hour play limit (which the game does a pretty good job of obeying) -
and as the plot develops, the resemblance to "Highlander" fades.
"Augustine" has plenty of flaws, but its story is interesting enough
that it's worth a look.

VERSION: -

(The reader should be informed beforehand that all my oh-so-clever insinuations 
following came to me as an afterthought. While actually playing A&B, I was just 
enjoying the ride for the most part, never being distracted by secondary 
ponderings.)

The game has (and the author's blurb for it seems to endorse it) an unmistakable 
P. G. Woodhouse-feel (reminding of the Jeeves and Wooster series in particular), 
but as I thought about it more closely, I realized it wasn't *that* Woodhouse-
like at all.

Why do I think so? Well, remember the original novels: Wooster appears before us 
not just as a mere blunderer (although this part of his nature usually plays a 
major role in the story) but also as the nobility in the flesh, a person who 
very rarely, if at all, pursues one's own ends, and who's ready to risk his own 
reputation to help out his friend (well, actually, the choice is made for him in 
most cases, but that's another thing).

In Aunts and Butlers, however, we find an entirely different kind of person as a 
protagonist: a very purposeful man who not only knows what he wants, but is also 
capable of acting pretty mean at times to reach his goals. If anything, A&B 
represents a post-Woodhouse setting, where most of Wooster's fortune has 
trickled away through his fingers (which seems pretty realistic, since he's 
never been a man too concerned about his revenues, to put it mildly), carrying 
away most of his aristocratic scruples and complications, and replacing them 
with healthy cynicism in the process. This personality change did him good in 
the long run -- by the end of the story, our hero not only gains his wealth 
back, but also acquires something the original Wooster never could even dream 
of; I mean the esteem of his valet, who stops treating his master as a mix of a 
child to be nursed and a marionette to be manipulated, and begins to see him as 
an equal partner (granted, the last one is my assumption, but it's more or less 
implied by the game).

If I were the game author, I'd provide A&B with the subtitle "Revenge of Bertie 
Wooster", because the protagonist really pays back the people who's been 
torturing him in the original Woodhouse novels. The only thing I missed in this 
respect in the game was a nasty prank on Bingo Little (you know, something like 
sending him down a smelly trash chute to the feet of his oblivious wife and 
uncle.)

If you aren't as much a fan of P. G. Woodhouse as I am, you'll probably see 
Aunts and Butlers just as a light-hearted, not too deep work with an 
unproblematic gameplay, good enough to while away an hour or so. It has a slight 
general adventuring  frosting, which isn't necessarily needed and could be 
removed without anybody missing it, yet, on the other hand, it doesn't hamper 
the game, either. Isn't this worth a rating of at least 6 points? Sure it is.

There's one more thing, though: A&B hasn't been created with one of the major 
IF-development systems -- instead, the author employed JavaScript. In itself, 
this isn't such a rare thing; it's the surprisingly good parser that makes it 
practically unique. You couldn't find any complaints about it in my review,
could you? That's because it's really on a par with the needs and expectations 
of the modern text adventurer, or at least very close to that. I imagine what an 
awfully huge lot of work it must have taken to bring it to that quality level 
from scratch! Well, doesn't this extra amount of work deserve an increase of the 
game rating by at least one point? Sure it does -- at least as far as I'm

VERSION: Release 1

Considering that &quot;The Awakening&quot; by Dennis Matheson is a rather small
game, I was pleasently surprised by both plot and atmosphere of the
game.

The game starts out with the player finding himself in an old,
decaying churchyard during a thunderstorm, not knowing how he came
there nor who he is. But both the fact that he's originally located in
an earth pit and the name of the adventure lead up to some
suspicions...

Besides, the author mentions to have been inspired by the works of
Lovecraft, so for me the setting of the game was, if not outright
obviously, so at least in all probability, part of the Lovecraftian
Universe, with strange and malovelent forces at work.

During the course of the game I found this to be true, and by and by
learnt more about my surroundings, and the goal I had to achieve,
until I was able to defy these forces and win &quot;freedom&quot;.

The atmosphere, especially during the first part of the game, is quite
dense.  Especially, once I was inside the church, I felt like an
intruder, at a place where some tradegy had already occured, trying to
make sense of the remnants.

But the end of the game came as something of an anti-climax to me: I
had no problems to win against my antagonist, and no final explanation
was offered to fill a few gaps I had noticed, just a plain
***You have won*** message.

But, as I said before, &quot;The Awakening&quot; is a short piece of interactive
fiction, and therefore due to lack some fleshing out that a bigger
game perhaps would have had. For its length it's really a fine example
of the art, capturing in its story, and convincing in its atmosphere.

I've totally forgotten to mention the technical side, and that's
probably because I found no flaws there, no bugs or parser problems,
which of course heightened the pleasure of playing &quot;The Awakening&quot;.

&quot;The Awakening&quot; is a short-short horror with a clear and admitted
homage to H. P. Lovecraft (HPL), complete with elements lifted directly
from &quot;The Outsider&quot; and other of that seminal author's works. It's a
&quot;first game&quot;, too, and taken as such, it's certainly not bad.

But the game can be seen to illustrate some of the larger issues that
arise when trying to bring the feel of HPL to IF. On the good side, a
lack of dialogue and human interaction (which HPL felt to be
antithetical to the atmosphere he was trying to create) makes
sidestepping classic IF NPC issues easier. On the bad side, the
kleptomaniacal, Wile-E.-Coyote-esque aspect of the adventurer doesn't
mix well with lurking horrors.

In other words, running around with ladders and being chased by dogs
present me with comic images--made even more comic by the fact that I
knew from the start (as any reader of HPL would) the secret behind the
&quot;purple tablecloth&quot;.

I know the writing worked for a lot of people, but I'm still scratching
my head over &quot;storm tossed sky&quot; (not to mention the Zork-esque &quot;storm
tossed branches&quot;), concaphony, and the &quot;iron-barred fence&quot; in the
initial descriptions. (A fence barred by iron? A fence made of iron
bars?) Not to mention prose peppered with &quot;seems&quot;.  (I'll assume that
the adjective-heavy segments in the beginning of the game are an homage
to HPL.) 

Some of the weather effects didn't quite make it for me, either. The
frequency of the intermittent hailstorms drew my attention to the fact
that I was being fed random weather effects.

There was some satisfaction in solving the puzzles, although there is
an instant death puzzle at the end (which you can avoid by talking to
an NPC).  They mostly made sense and some effort was made to avoid
having the player get into unwinnable state. (Though the hint system
actually encourages the hapless user to get into an unwinnable state,
if he's trying to minimize his use of it.)

The arrangement of hints is poor: I'd say half the hints are worthless,
and they detract from any sense of atmosphere, even ending with &quot;That's
All Folks&quot; when they have been exhausted.

There are a number of out-of-place messages, some from the Inform
standard library (like &quot;Violence isn't the answer to this one.&quot;) and
one gets the idea that the author hasn't quite patched up all the
holes.  You can, for example, tie a rope to the limb of the tree, only
to receive the message &quot;The broken limb isn't attached to anything&quot;
when you try to &quot;untie limb&quot;.

This is a somewhat harsh review but, as I point out, the game isn't bad.
There are some nice atmospheric touches and the author shows more care
with the story than one might expect from such a small game. Nonetheless,
a game (however short) that is dependent so heavily on atmosphere needs
to take impeccable care with the details or risk losing his audience
before they get to the &quot;frisson&quot;.

<A NAME="awe"><h2>The Awe-Chasm</h2>
From: Christopher E. Forman &lt;ceforman SP@G worldnet.att.net&gt; 
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag8.html">SPAG #8</a> -- February 5, 1996

NAME: The Awe-Chasm (a.k.a The Chasm of Awe, a.k.a. Snatch and Crunch II)
PARSER: C Adventure Toolkit
AUTHOR: Tony Stiles                              PLOT: Dungeon Quest
EMAIL: ???                                       ATMOSPHERE: Very little
AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF Archive               WRITING: Decidedly unfunny
PUZZLES: Generic/pseudo-logical                  SUPPORTS: PCs, Atari STs
CHARACTERS: Unresponsive                         DIFFICULTY: Painful to play

        Start with a rather straightforward late-1970s style dungeon
quest/treasure hunt.  Now add a remarkably crude and unpretentiously juvenile
sense of humor.  Stir in a frustrating parser and some poorly-implemented, at
best semi-logical, puzzles.  Blend into this a sloppy overall design, and, to
give a slight flavor of anti-logic, top the whole thing off with a dash of
sheer incomprehensibility.  Following this recipe, the resulting mixture is a
serious candidate for the very worst text adventure ever written.
        In this case, author Tony Stiles has cooked up an unappetizing little
dish titled &quot;The Awe-Chasm,&quot; a.k.a &quot;The Chasm of Awe,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Snatch and
Crunch II.&quot;  (Personally, I've never seen or heard of &quot;Snatch and Crunch I,&quot;
but it must have been good enough to justify the making of this sequel.)
        Snatch and Crunch, the two main characters in this game, are, in the
author's own words, a &quot;pokey pervert&quot; and a &quot;monolithic mutant,&quot; respectively.
For reasons unknown (good old-fashioned greed perhaps?), they're out to
explore the many caverns and passageways of the Awe-Chasm in search of
treasure.  During the course of the game, the I-Fer can type &quot;BECOME SNATCH&quot;
or &quot;BECOME CRUNCH&quot; to switch control back and forth between Snatch and Crunch,
using each one in tasks for which he is specifically suited -- some puzzles
can only be solved using one of our two explorers.  Snatch and Crunch can
also work together, with Crunch picking up the smaller Snatch and carrying
him along on his shoulders.
        While this may sound promising, the game doesn't really put forth
the extra effort necessary to make it work.  Neither Snatch nor Crunch seems
to have much personality, so it's hard to figure out who can do what unless
the game specifically tells you (which, in most cases, it doesn't).  Perhaps
the player is expected to bring this knowledge over from the first &quot;Snatch
and Crunch&quot; game.  Further, unless Snatch is being carried, the duo doesn't
move around together -- the player must move Snatch and Crunch individually,
and having to retrace your steps is tedious.  It would have worked much
better to have the pair stay together for the most part, providing a special
&quot;SPLIT&quot; command for the few times when they need to go their separate ways.
        Complicating matters is the sloppy overall design of the game.  It's
very linear at the start, until the player figures out how to buy a lamp.
This had me stuck until I stumbled across a walkthrough of the first few
puzzles amongst the myriad seemingly useless files zipped in with the game
executable.  My problems were more due to parser quirks than anything else.
Did I talk about the parser yet?  Perhaps I should do that now.
        The author wrote his own adventure design system, called the &quot;C
Adventure Toolkit&quot; to create this game.  While I must bow slightly to such an
impressive feat, the sad truth of the matter is that the parser just isn't
very good -- it's barely adequate for the game.  There are very few synonyms
for nouns -- you can't call a pond a &quot;lake,&quot; for instance -- and some commands
only work properly if prepositions are used -- &quot;GET EMILY&quot; fails; you must say
&quot;GET EMILY FROM POND&quot;.  (Emily, in this case, happens to be a fish with whom
Crunch, the &quot;monolithic mutant,&quot; is infatuated, and...oh, just forget it.)  For
simple interactions (directional moves, two-word commands, etc.) the parser
works okay.  For longer, more complex sentences, though, it's not even up to
the standards of AGT, let alone Inform and TADS.  (It's dated 1989, BTW.)
        But now back to the game, which becomes more frustrating once the
player acquires a lamp and descends into the Awe-Chasm (&quot;a chasm of orgasmic
proportions,&quot; the game shamelessly announces).  There are several levels to
the chasm, some of which have openings leading to tunnels.  What's
particularly noteworthy here is that, when climbing between levels, there's a
good chance you'll fall to the bottom of the chasm and have to climb back up
several levels again.  This happens far, FAR too often to even be called
infuriating.  After five or six times, you'll want to quit right then and
there.  (I didn't even get a quarter of the way through the 500-point game.)
        The tunnel openings themselves are equally frustrating to navigate.
They are listed in room descriptions as &quot;an opening,&quot; but no compass
directions for them are given or recognized.  Players must type &quot;ENTER
OPENING&quot; to go inside, and &quot;ENTER OPENING&quot; again to come back.  Doors must be
traversed in the same manner.  What's so difficult about allowing directional
commands?
        &quot;The Awe-Chasm&quot; showcases an astoundingly juvenile sense of humor.
It almost seems as though the author is attempting to imitate the style used
by Steve Meretzky in some of his racier titles.  But Meretzky's writing
exudes personality, and his characterization in &quot;LGOP&quot; and the &quot;SpellCasting&quot;
series makes the &quot;naughty&quot; bits more charming than offensive.  &quot;Awe-Chasm&quot;'s
writing offers little characterization and little personality, and the
overall result is decidedly distasteful.
        On top of all this, the game just isn't very well planned out.  The
best dungeon adventures (by which I mean &quot;Colossal Cave&quot; and the &quot;Zork&quot;
series) employ a degree of continuity between their locations, adding realism
to the layout.  In &quot;Awe-Chasm,&quot; rooms are slapped together clumsily and
objects are thrown about with no thought whatsoever.  One tunnel, for
instance, harbors a band of sex-starved nymphomaniacs to assault our heroes.
Yet for some reason, they've never ventured into the throne room a few levels
down to visit King Tony (another personal appearance by a game author
degenerating into a very tired and unfunny inside joke).  Other thrills and
chills awaiting you include a slew of locked doors (at least three more than
ANY adventure game needs), the &quot;magical mystery maze&quot; (three guesses as to
what this is, and the first two don't count), and the &quot;Oh sh*t, all my
treasures have been scattered&quot; room (crusaders for fairness in I-F need not
apply).
        The game is not without its cult value, however.  Fans of truly
abysmal I-F should get plenty of howls out of the flaws inherent in &quot;The
Awe-Chasm,&quot; but everyone else is better advised to leave the &quot;monolithic
mutant&quot; and the &quot;pokey pervert&quot; to fend for themselves.
