VERSION: Release 0.3 (beta?!?)

E-Mailbox is without a doubt the shortest entry in the 1997
competition; it's almost impossible to spend more than 15 minutes on
it, even if you try everything there is to try. The plot: you sign on
with an ISP, you send a message, you get mailbombed, you get the
account resurrected, and you get mail. There's a cute real-virtual
sense, in that you get your mail from a "mailbox", but there's not a
lot there. If you do the obvious thing at every juncture, you'll be
just fine with E-Mailbox. There are some mechanical problems, but not
enough to slow progress significantly; most actions that aren't what
the author had in mind elicit "You're wasting your time!" or something
similar.

The problem here is not the concept--okay, maybe it is exciting the
first time--so much as the audience. The players of the 1997
interactive fiction competition are, by definition, those people with
the connections, software, and wherewithal to connect to an archive in
Germany, download a series of games, set them up on their own
computers, and play them. In that playing E-Mailbox required locating
and downloading the AGiliTy interpreter, there was another degree of
complication in there. Now, I don't actually think all of that is
extremely complicated, but I do think that those who happen to
play--meaning the IF community, which exists solely by virtue of the
Internet--are not likely to be those still gasping over the wonders of
e-mail. (We may recall the inane AOL commercial wherein a woman says
"Every time I get e-mail, it's like opening a present." Very likely,
for the first few times or so, but most IFers, I fear, are a bit
hardened.) I'm not, of course, saying that Jay Goemmer is one. Very
likely he isn't. But it's a bit of a stretch to ask the player for
whom the Internet is simply a fact of life to exclaim loudly over its
wonders.

There's another possibility that I'm neglecting, namely that
Mr. Goemmer is poking a little fun at newbies and their "how do I send
e-mail?" ways and inviting us to join in the humor. It's possible, and
sentences like "Smack the Return key--*really* good" do bring up the
image of a frustrated newbie taking out his anger on his unsuspecting
keyboard.  Somehow, though, this doesn't have the air of an insider
chuckling at an outside, if for no other reason than that an account
that actually gets mailbombed has problems that simply reinstalling
the software ain't gonna fix, no how, no way. It's possible that
Mr. Goemmer is mistaking a software bug or some such thing for a
mailbomb; we can't know for sure.  (Though an address that's only just
been created isn't likely to get bombed.) Somehow, though, the tone
doesn't say "parody" to me--the whole things is taken a bit too
seriously--and while I appreciate the enthusiasm, I didn't go into
vicarious paroxysms of joy.

For the record, AGT comes off fine--impressive speed, though then
again it should be, running such a small game file. But apart from
reliving the thrill of getting e-mail for the first time, there isn't
enough here to justify the download time, I'm afraid.

VERSION: Release 1

This game is too short.

It's billing itself as a prelude to something longer, and that's great,
but I felt as though I had just really gotten revved up when... it
ended.

Which was a pity, because I was enjoying this: it's upbeat and chipper
and fun, a superhero game with a gentle sense of humor and not too much
pressure about Saving the Universe. It gives you cool powers, and it
doesn't take itself too seriously. We've seen superhero IF before, but
frankly, it's so entertaining that we can easily afford to see more.

Earth and Sky begins by establishing backstory about the protagonist and
her brother, in which we find out that their parents are missing;
presumably this provides the plot arc for the series of games of which
this is Game 1. But the game doesn't really dwell particularly on that.
I was struck by the contrast with Heroine's Mantle, another superhero
game whose premise begins with the vanishing of parents and the
introduction of powers: where Heroine was sprawling, dramatic,
emotional, and rough-edged in many aspects of its game play, this was a
meticulously crafted and entirely lighthearted production.

Let me dwell for a moment on that "meticulously crafted" bit. It's
obvious that a great deal of care went into making this game intuitively
interactive. Several conversation systems are provided, so that the
player is free to take whatever approach he likes: this is novel, and
possibly overkill, but it expresses a good faith intention to put the
control fully into the player's hands. More impressively, perhaps, the
game accounts for a wide variety of behavior on the player's part. I
don't wish to spoil the game, and it is so small that any portion of it,
even the very beginning, is perhaps off-limits, so suffice it to say
that there is an opening scene with a number of things to tinker with. A
less ambitious game would take steps to make sure that the player
tinkered with them in the right order; a less well-programmed one would
allow all the variations, but then fail to take them into account in the
subsequent stages of the scenario. As it was, I found no flaws. After I
played the first time, I went back and tried a number of different
configurations of the first scene, and the NPC always reacted
appropriately, no matter what I turned out to have done when he showed
up.

Speaking of the NPC, I'm not sure how I feel about the menus. The game
offers you the opportunity to converse via conversation menus, and these
menus contain numerous quips. This is fine, even commendable, except
that frequently the quips were merely slightly nuanced variations of the
same thing and that the choice of one or another doesn't seem to have
affected the NPC especially strongly. There are also perhaps too many. I
find, in general, that I don't like conversation menus to contain more
entries than I can keep in my head all at once; it is perhaps a
testimony to my pea-sized brain that this number tends to be four or
five at its upper limit (with some variation allowed depending on how
complex and lengthy the remarks are.) This is because, when I am playing
a game with conversation menus, I regard the menu as representing the
contents of the PC's head: as though the author said, Here are the
things that immediately pop to mind in response. In a typical
conversation I may have several things in mind that would be viable to
say; I don't have a dozen at a time.

That's a fairly minor quibble, however, and the fact that I reacted to
it at all says more about my own interests and the things I pay
attention to in a game.

Summary: cool, fun, and promising of more to come. One of my favorites
of the competition.

TITLE: The Ebb and the Flow of the Tide
AUTHOR: Peter Nepstad
E-MAIL: petern SP@G illuminatedlantern.com

PARSER: TADS 2

VERSION: 1.1

The Ebb and Flow of the Tide is the second of Peter Nepstad's IF interpretations 
of Lord Dunsany's short stories, the first being <a href="j.html#king">The Journey of the King</a> 
released in November 2006.

"Tide" is certainly the more successful, perhaps because the story itself is 
more readily adapted to IF and also perhaps because the prose of the story is 
less florid and more accessible to the 21st century reader. 

Fans of the usual action-adventure will take some comfort in the fact that the 
PC can not be killed during the course of the game, for the simple and somewhat 
novel reason that the protagonist starts out in this unfortunate state. 

As one can imagine, this somewhat limits the actions available to the PC, but 
the author has done a good job implementing all of the sensory commands - 
listen, feel, smell, taste.  

This should be kept in mind, as arguably the most used command in more 
conventional IF, examine, will not always further the story.  I would not call 
them "guess the verb" problems although they superficially resemble same, merely 
that the author forces the player to take a somewhat less orthodox approach 
given the limitations of the PC.  With this in mind, play should take no more 
than 15 or 20 minutes.   

Beyond this unusual twist, play is bug free and cues are well integrated into 
the responses; for example at one point examining a wall will reveal the 
existence of passages which can then be further investigated with the sensorium 
available to the PC.  At no point is a player left to wonder what to do next 
provided that they've investigated all of the current options at hand. 

The Ebb and Flow of the Tide is a memorable game, not least due to the efforts 
of the game author. The Dunsany tale is a somewhat chilling dream sequence but 
ultimately of little import; Mr. Nepstad's interpretation gave it life and 
immediacy.   

Out of 10 I give it a 3 for simplicity and 8 overall.

Lucian Smith's "The Edifice" is one of the simplest games in the
competition -- head games involving puzzling out what's going on are
few -- but it also tells one of the most effective stories. (Well,
okay, some of the entries don't have much of a story at all to tell,
but that's different.) Edifice is an example of IF where desultory
puzzles don't matter: it's the story, and the concept driving it, that
counts, and this is one of the best game ideas this year's competition
produced.

This is an allegory: you represent primitive man, moving through the
various stages of evolution as represented by levels in a strange
stone edifice that appears before you suddenly. The puzzles represent
problems along the way of evolution, problems whose mastery defined
certain levels of development -- they're mostly straightforward
(though one is a bit confusing), but there is a real sense of
accomplishment in solving them, somehow. Certain stages are by
definition mind-numbingly tedious, which reflects the subject
accurately -- these are problems that involve tedium -- but also raise
the question of whether there might have been a better way to design
those particular puzzles. (For a similar problem, see <a href="m.html#sherbet">The Meteor, the<br>Stone, and a Long Glass of Sherbet</a>.) It should be added that the<br>author isn't trying to convey every single aspect of every phase of<br>evolution; rather, you represent an important breakthrough at each<br>stage, and when you're done, you move on and reenter the scene much<br>later, when Homo sapiens has incorporated your discovery and built on<br>it.<br><br>That raises the question that I, at least, found most intriguing about<br>this: does this really have anything to do with evolution? It's kind<br>of a silly approximation, after all, since it's apparent quite soon in<br>each stage what the sought-for breakthrough is, and it's just a<br>question of putting together the needed materials or figuring out the<br>key steps. But it could be argued that Smith has designed this with<br>the feeling of discovery in mind: particularly in the last two scenes,<br>you have the sense of a specific need that drives the breakthrough,<br>not a sudden resolve out of the blue to carve hand tools or<br>domesticate animals. The sense of logical connection is less strong in<br>the first one; there is very little sense that you tumble to your<br>discovery because of circumstances, rather than having a<br>twentieth-century computer user push him around to accomplish a<br>certain goal. Perhaps that's inevitable, given the problem at hand,<br>but I would have liked to have seen at least some sort of conjecture<br>as to what sort of circumstances lit up that particular connection for<br>Stone Age man. The game does capture the brutality of this particular<br>discovery well, in that you have no particular reason other than your<br>own satisfaction for doing what you do, and perhaps the apparent<br>purposeless of your solution to the problem reflects the arbitrary<br>kill-or-be- killed nature of the environment -- but it still felt a<br>little unsatisfying.<br><br>On the whole, I found the second stage most plausible and interesting;<br>it's the only one where you deal with other characters, and though<br>your interactions are limited, the characters have a certain charm. (I<br>found a certain whimsical appeal in their names -- Wife, Son,<br>Grandmother.) The central puzzle took real thought and felt genuinely<br>rewarding to solve -- and, even as a microcosm, it felt more than any<br>of the problems like what really might have happened. The first stage,<br>as suggested, is a little too illogical to really feel like an account<br>of the breakthrough, and the third just doesn't quite make enough<br>sense; you have the sense of the original motivation for your<br>character, but not what inspired him to try this particular<br>approach. (And the realism/tedium element that worked reasonably well<br>in the first part is simply annoying here, because it doesn't feel<br>particularly logical.) Still, all three are worthy concepts, mostly<br>well thought out.<br><br>The writing is nothing special, though arguably that makes sense here<br>-- too much attention to the scenery or aesthetics would distract from<br>the goals at hand; you're not in the situations in question to check<br>out the sights.  Certainly, the writing is adequate for the purposes;<br>it sets the scene and makes clear what you need to do. My main problem<br>with the mechanics of Edifice is that it's possible in the first part<br>to screw up and require a fairly laborious process of restarting (it's<br>probably quicker just to RESTART), which, quite apart from its<br>problems for the IF player, doesn't really make much sense in the plot<br>of the game. (The nature of the problems was such that the solutions<br>developed over time, after all; it took many failures to make the<br>discoveries required in each scene.) In several key respects, the<br>first scene requires resources that can be easily wasted -- and though<br>the urgency of the situation lends a certain logic to the picture (if<br>you don't solve the problem, you'll die), it still doesn't really make<br>much sense as an evolutionary tableau.<br><br>Another clunky element is the hint system, which rests in a mural in<br>the edifice -- clever enough, but the problem is that the mural only<br>gives you the hint once you've gone out and actually done each step<br>and come back and checked the mural, which I found time-consuming and<br>annoying. You can't, in short, play to where you get stuck, then come<br>back and check the mural, because the mural won't keep up with<br>you. Among problems to be fixed for future versions, this one may<br>be #1.<br><br>The end is a bit confusing. There is a cataclysmic event at the end<br>that doesn't seem to fit into the evolutionary frame, as far as I can<br>tell, and my guess was that it's the author's device for ending the<br>story. If so, it's intriguing -- but the final sentence, even when<br>you've finished the game "right" (in accordance with the walkthrough,<br>anyway), is a bit of a puzzler. I couldn't decide whether it was a<br>comment on the nature of evolution or simply a bug; if it was supposed<br>to be the former, it could perhaps have been more skillfully done. (At<br>least, it might have a sentence somehow distinguishing it from less<br>satisfactory endings.) And while I enjoyed the ending -- it had plenty<br>of drama -- it did weaken the allegory a bit; certainly, the<br>evolutionary process didn't end where it does in this game, but the<br>conclusion of the game suggests some sort of ending.<br><br>Quibbles aside, though, The Edifice is one of the most intriguing<br>games in the competition, in that it tries something completely new --<br>a first-person account of the highlights of a scientific process. In a<br>sense, your actions are vital to the continuation of that process --<br>if you choose not to go on, progress stops with you -- and one way to<br>see your role in the game is that of a guiding force at crucial<br>moments in history, an intervention to ensure that the development of<br>man stays on track. That, at least, would explain some of the knottier<br>problems involving questionable motivations or the difficulty of<br>anticipating a particular result without the player's advance<br>knowledge. Part of the charm of Edifice is that the story it tells is<br>sufficiently ambiguous that it can justify a variety of perspectives,<br>including those who don't care for evolution as a self-perpetuating<br>force at all. (The game, whether deliberately or not, provides some<br>grist for the mill of the argument that mere chance could not been<br>sufficient to turn ape into man.)<br><br>Though elements of the gameplay are lacking somewhat, anything that<br>Edifice lacks in playability is easily made up in sheer concept; the<br>idea and the charm of its implementation earn this one an 8 on the<br>competition scale.<br><br><br>From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;<br>Review appeared in <a href="backissues/spag13.html">SPAG #13</a> -- February 5, 1998<br><br>You're an ape, spending your days hunting for Food and fleeing from<br>Enemies. You have these little thumbs, too, that set you apart from<br>the Others. Suddenly one day, a huge black Edifice appears before you,<br>arousing your wonder and suspicion. I can almost hear "Also Sprach<br>Zarathustra" in the background: Daaaaaaaa, Daaaaaaaaa,<br>Daaaaaaaaaa.....  Da-Dummmmmmm! However, from this highly derivative<br>beginning, the Edifice ventures quickly into much more original<br>territory. It seems that once you enter the monolith, you find<br>yourself able to enter various stages of human development, from the<br>discovery of fire to protecting your village against plundering<br>marauders. The idea works very nicely, putting the player into<br>puzzle-solving situations which blend very naturally into the game's<br>environment and using the edifice itself as a sort of frame around the<br>smaller narratives as well as a hinting device.<br><br>One section of the game in particular I found really remarkable. On<br>the second level of the edifice, you find yourself as a very early<br>human, living in a family unit in the woods. Your son has a fever, and<br>to cure him you must find the Feverleaf, which can be made into a<br>healing tea.  However, no Feverleaf seems to be available anywhere,<br>until you stumble across a Stranger. Unsurprisingly, however, the<br>Stranger does not speak your language, and so you are faced with a<br>problem of communication. The game does an incredible job with<br>simulating this situation. I was astonished at the level of realism<br>which this character was able to achieve, and at the care that must<br>clearly have gone into fashioning this interaction. I've rarely seen<br>such a thorough and effective establishment of the illusion of<br>interactivity. The Stranger did not of course respond to English words<br>in understandable ways. However, you could point to objects, or speak<br>words in the Stranger's language, and gradually the two of you could<br>arrive at an understanding. It was an amazing feeling to be<br>experiencing this kind of exchange in IF... I really felt like I *was*<br>learning the Stranger's language. It will always remain one of the<br>most memorable moments of this 1997 competition for me.<br><br>I spent a lot of time on this one encounter, but I spent more time on<br>the first level of the edifice, where you learn basic skills like how<br>to hunt and build a fire. All of the puzzles in this section were<br>logical, and the implementation was characteristically thorough and<br>rich. However, this level is also where I ran into the game's one<br>major flaw: its scoring system. Upon typing "score", you are told<br>something along the lines of "You have visited two levels of the<br>Edifice and solved none of them.  You are amazingly discontent."<br>However, sometimes "amazingly discontent" changes to "very content."<br>for reasons that aren't at all clear. Moreover, I did everything that<br>the hints indicate on that level, but the game still insisted I had<br>not solved it. I worked on this until I got so frustrated with it that<br>I just went up to the next level. I'm not sure whether these<br>irregularities in the scoring system were intentional or not, but I<br>found that they were the only significant detractions from an<br>otherwise excellent game.<br><br>Prose: The author did a superb job with the prose. Objects and rooms<br>were described carefully and concisely, and in fact their descriptions<br>often changed to reflect the character's expanding knowledge. In the<br>beginning, words are simple and their meanings often archetypal: Rock,<br>Enemies, Others, etc. As the game progresses and the character<br>continues to evolve, the diction becomes more complex and the meanings<br>more specific. This is the type of prose effect that a graphical game<br>could never achieve, since it arises from the nature of the prose<br>itself. That the game can achieve this effect shows that it is very<br>well written indeed.<br><br>Plot: The game's plot is a clever device to put the player into<br>various moments in the history of human development. Its central<br>device is rather clearly lifted from 2001:A Space Odyssey, but other<br>than that it's an excellent frame story around fascinating vignettes.<br><br>Puzzles: I think the language puzzle was the best one I've seen in<br>interactive fiction this year. Certainly it was the best in the<br>competition -- it advanced the narrative, developed the character,<br>achieved a new kind of IF character interaction, and packed a powerful<br>Sense of Wonder. The other puzzles I encountered were also very good,<br>arising quite intuitively out of the game's situation and objects. My<br>only frustration was with the elements of the game which suggested I<br>had more to solve but never seemed to indicate what those things were.<br><br>Technical:<br>writing -- The Edifice's prose was quite error-free.<br>coding -- Aside from the problems with the scoring system, the coding<br>was outstanding. Synonyms abounded, and almost all logical or<br>intuitively available actions were accounted for. I have no doubt that<br>the problems with the scoring system arose from the complexity of the<br>game, and that they will be resolved in the next release. When that<br>happens, Edifice will have eradicated its one significant flaw.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/edifice.z5">

VERSION: First release

Once in a while I get my hands on a game that is unusual in so many ways I don't 
even know where to start. You know, the kind that doesn't seem to hold much 
promise at first, but then you notice this nice feature, and that one, and you 
want to play just a little further before going to bed... you're charmed.

To get one thing out of the way, Ekphrasis is written in French. If you speak 
the language but haven't played a French text adventure before, don't worry. 
Most commands are what you'd expect, shortcuts included (such as 'x' for 
'examiner'). You can even go west by typing 'w', something I did without even 
thinking about it. Be sure to type 'aide' at the beginning; it  will point out a 
less obvious command that happens to be used a lot during the game.

The story is reminiscent of an old stylish detective movie. A particular
Renaissance painting appears to have been stolen and replaced with a copy. 
You've been called to evaluate it, but things are a lot more complicated than 
they first seem. Being a cranky old professor with a distaste for modern 
technology doesn't help either. If you're expecting humor, you won't be 
disappointed. I haven't had such a laugh since Dutch Dapper IV.

The gameplay is neatly divided between interactive scenes and "talk to"-
triggered dialogues. The former are short and focused, usually one or two 
locations with a handful of items and NPCs and a clear goal; the latter are 
long-ish but charming, and do a great job of portraying the characters. 
Otherwise there isn't much in the way of literary style. Ekphrasis relies on 
pictures - otherwise beautiful - to describe the locations. Too bad it also 
relies on pictures for essential information such as phone numbers, which really 
should stay in the text. Be sure to keep the walkthrough at hand.

One thing the game is particularly good at is feeling natural. Most locations 
are famous spots in Europe; the NPCs and situations are what you'd expect to 
find there. Even the maze towards the end (yes, there's a maze!) is perfectly 
justified, and not all that complicated. The NPCs, though unhelpful, are at 
least pro-active, often starting conversations on their own. Puzzles are 
generally logical, but they sometimes require perfect timing and/or performing a 
precise sequence of steps which may not be so obvious. Add to that my abysmal 
puzzle-solving skills and the sheer length of the game and you'll see why I 
ended up following the walkthrough a lot. Except, of course, when following it a 
la lettre led to an untimely death. Oh well, it's a big game. Things can easily 
go out of sync.

Speaking of size, Ekphrasis is too large for its own good. I spent more than ten 
hours on the game, or so I think, because I lost count with all the loading and 
saving. Apparently, so did the author. Most of the scenery is not implemented, 
not even as a "you don't need that" message. A lot of synonyms are missing in 
action as well, which can become quite a problem when the game fails to 
recognize a noun from its own room descriptions. There's also a good deal of 
"read the author's mind" towards the end. I suppose it's difficult to explain 
everything when you write such a big game all by yourself. And despite the 
author's assurances that specialist knowledge is not required to win, there were
a couple of spots when even Wikipedia couldn't help me.

All in all, the game kept me interested to the end despite all the annoyances. 
Fun, education, suspense and even romance - Ekphrasis has them all, so allow me 
to conclude as a Frenchman would: chapeau!

P.S. I was unable to hear the sound for technical reasons, so I can't make any 
comments about it; my apologies to everyone interested.

VERSION: 2.01

As anyone who read my IF Comp reviews last year will know, The Elysium Enigima 
was my game of the Comp.  I noted at the time that I would like to return to it 
later to try for a full score, something the game encouraged when I completed it 
by helpfully suggesting some things that I left undone and might want to try 
next time.  I had intended to play it again soon after the Comp, but Last Resort 
and the holiday season intervened.  When Elysium won the XYZZY awards this year 
for Best Game and Best NPC, however, I was reminded to return to it, armed with 
my list of additional things to try to accomplish in search of a full score, to 
see if it was really as good as my almost embarrassingly enthusiastic previous 
review would indicate.  And so I downloaded the latest post-Comp release and 
dove in.  I am still very impressed, but also noticed a few things that bothered 
me this time around, as I was able to spend more time with the game and, 
unbothered by the joy of first discovery, view it with a bit more of a critical 
eye.

First, though, let me explain the premise and the many positives for anyone 
coming to the game for the first time through this review.  You play the role of 
a rather junior interstellar diplomat sent on a routine mission to the planet of 
Elysium, a backwater colony world populated by ludites who reject all but the 
most basic technology and have a rather ambivalent attitude about being a part 
of the Empire you work for at all.  You are supposed to -- literally -- show the 
imperial flag, meet with a few of the society's elders if they desire it and 
make note of their concerns or complaints, and be on your way. The inevitable 
complications arise in the form of a mysterious and attractive female who 
doesn't seem to belong here.  You must also deal with the suspicious natives, 
and may even be able to learn the reasons for their latent hostility toward the 
Empire.  A lot is going on here, and the story, setting, and implementation are 
as well fleshed-out as you are likely to find in IF.  Like all of Eric Eve's 
TADS 3 work, the whole serves as fine advertisement for the power of TADS 3.

Most of the commentary on the game has focused, rightfully so, on the mysterious 
Leena, one of its three NPCs.  You meet her early in the game, when she 
approaches you in the guise of a dirty and apparently hungry, but nevertheless 
very shapely, outcast.  Much of the game revolves around figuring out just who 
and what she really is.  I am already treading right on the line of spoilerdom 
here, so I will not go into more detail but rather defer to Valentine 
Koptelsev's SPAG Specifics piece, which focuses on Leena's role in the game.  I 
agree with many of Valentine's concerns about Leena's sometimes illogical 
behavior, but also remain very impressed with Mr. Eve's masterful job in 
creating her.  You can converse with Leena in great depth and breadth.  The TADS 
3 conversation system is in full flower.  Talking with Leena doesn't feel like a 
game of "guess the topic," but rather feels at certain stretches like real 
conversation, as the two of you probe and feint, each trying to determine just 
what the other is really about.  It's a fine merging of technical and artistic 
mastery that remains as impressive to me as it did when I first played the game. 
These interactions with Leena and (to a lesser extant) the two other NPCs, 
along with the thoroughly implemented environment, pull the game away from the 
text adventure feel and into something that feels more like a true interactive 
story.

I think this feeling contributes to the disappointment I felt with some of the 
non-character interaction puzzles.  First, though, I should mention that Mr. Eve 
did vastly improve in this post-Comp release the most egregious offender, a 
fiddly puzzle that required a degree of, shall we say, lateral thinking, and was 
borderline unfair.  I complained about it in my previous review, and was 
apparently not alone.  It's nice to see an author listening to his players and 
taking his work seriously enough to revise it and incorporate their input.

Some of the other puzzles still bother me, though, because they destroy the 
sense of reality the game otherwise so masterfully creates.  The worst offender 
comes when you find a housecat lying on top of a chest you would dearly like to 
open.  Removing said cat requires solving a sequence of absurd puzzles that 
might be amusing in a Monkey Island-style comedy adventure but clash horribly 
with the believable tone of this story.  I am an intrepid, healthy young 
adventurer visiting a planet as the representative of a powerful Empire, and I 
am stymied by a housecat?  I love animals as much as the next guy, but... just 
kick the damn cat out of the way, already!  The game doesn't need stuff like 
this to artificially lengthen it.  

I want to see more simulation-oriented puzzle-solving in IF, something at which 
TADS 3 should excel, and less fiddly set-pieces like this.  (I know that places 
me outside the consensus position in the community, but so be it.)  Apparently 
others complained about some of the puzzles as well, as Mr. Eve mentions in his 
notes on this release that taking their suggestions would entail making more 
extensive revisions than he was ready to undertake, in effect making the new 
release into an entirely new game.  Fair enough, I can certainly understand that 
position, but do hope that he will consider our comments when writing his next 
game.  He is so very, very close to achieving the most fluid storytelling we 
have yet seen in IF that it is a shame to see his efforts foiled by 
ill-considered puzzles seemingly inserted out of a sense of obligation.

But let me place my complaints aside to state again that Elysium is a brilliant 
piece of work.  It does not attempt to radically, explicitly innovate for the 
sake of mere cleverness, but rather molds its form to its function of providing 
the player with a fun, immersive interactive story.  Even the writing does not 
call attention to itself, but flows fluidly and cleanly out of the way of the 
story.  The game stands as my personal favorite of a very strong year, and I am 
happy to see the XYZZY voters recognize it.  If you are reading this review to 
find out if you should play it... Yes, you should.

<a name="enchant">From: Duncan Stevens a.k.a. Second April &lt;dns361 SP@G merle.acns.nwu.edu&gt;<br>Review appeared in </a><a href="backissues/spag15.html">SPAG #15</a> -- October 11, 1998<br><br>NAME: Enchanter<br>AUTHOR: Marc Blank<br>E-MAIL: Beats me<br>DATE: 1983<br>PARSER: Infocom Standard<br>SUPPORTS: Infocom ports<br>AVAILABILITY: Commercial<br>URL: N/A<br>VERSION: Release 29<br><br>Enchanter, as most Infocom fans know, is the first in a fantasy series<br>intended to complement the <a href="z.html#zorktril">Zork trilogy</a>, a set of games where success<br>depends both on wits and on judicious use of magic. (By implication,<br>the adventurer in the Zork trilogy is a sort of grunt by contrast,<br>using combat skills as opposed to spell-casting, which isn't really<br>true--but the blend of the two in <a href="b.html#bzork">Beyond Zork</a> lends credence to the<br>idea that it was supposed to be a resolution to both trilogies.) The<br>player's use of magic in this series is based on a simple system of<br>copying spells into a book and then memorizing the spell each time it<br>is cast, an approach that has earned much criticism over the years but<br>which I still enjoy and find realistic (well, realistic on<br>fantasy-game terms, anyway). It feels more natural to have known<br>spells in a book than floating around in one's head constantly,<br>somehow, even though it can become a form of inventory<br>management. Part of the fun of this magic system, moreover, is the<br>humor value inherent in casting certain spells on inappropriate<br>objects (and the funny responses Infocom provided, of course).<br><br>Anyway, the plot of Enchanter is a fairly standard save-the-world<br>deal, wherein you, the novice enchanter, are sent into Krill's castle<br>because your powers are minimal enough that he won't bother to get rid<br>of you.  (Why it wouldn't be worth his while to smush someone prowling<br>around his castle isn't wholly clear to me, but oh well.) The layout<br>of the plot is rather "wide," in design parlance, meaning that almost<br>the entire territory and most of the puzzles are available early in<br>the game; it's up to you to figure out what can be solved at any given<br>time. Wide games can be irritating if the puzzles must be solved in<br>one particular order, but 'tisn't so in "Enchanter", fortunately;<br>quite a few of the puzzles are solvable very near the beginning of the<br>game.<br><br>The puzzles themselves are mostly good, and not especially difficult,<br>with one exception--one vital action is without motivation and relies<br>on a somewhat obscure hint. There is another instance of a verb I<br>didn't expect the game to recognize and spent hours upon hours<br>devising alternative solutions to the puzzle--and no, my copy was not<br>pirated; I just didn't think to look at the verb list, I guess. There<br>are a few other mildly unfair elements--the effects of a spell expire<br>after a small number of moves, but there's no way of knowing that (and<br>no sign when it happens) and it might seem at first like that spell<br>doesn't have the desired effect. Another puzzle, while the idea is<br>fairly obvious, requires considerable trial and error for success--and<br>there are some incorrect solutions, for which the game gives a fairly<br>obvious warning. As an introduction to the use of magic in puzzles,<br>Enchanter succeeds admirably; you use almost all of your spells at<br>least once, often in creative ways.  If there's a weakness here, it's<br>that virtually everything you do turns on magic; whereas the other two<br>installments in the series called for more puzzle-solving and less<br>trying spells, Enchanter is largely solvable by pulling out a spell<br>for every occasion. It's not a major drawback, but it's not optimal<br>either.<br><br>Enchanter's plot, as noted, is not especially innovative, and is beset<br>by contradictions, primary among them that Krill would not bother to<br>notice when you acquire the means to defeat him (and that said means<br>is sitting around in his own castle). That said, though, the<br>atmosphere and the setting are quite well done--the abandoned village,<br>the view of the castle from the Lonely Mountain, and the spread of the<br>effect of Krill's spell, characterized thus: "Everything you see is<br>gray and lifeless, as though covered with a veil of ash. Sound is<br>muted and there is a faint acrid odor." Room descriptions change as<br>well as the spell spreads, deteriorating from reasonably tidy<br>abandoned castle to something altogether more sinister; it reminded me<br>of the Nothing from Neverending Story. The effect is to lend some<br>urgency to the plot, even though the time allotted to accomplish the<br>mission is far more than needed, and to make the game something more<br>than a collection of puzzles. There is humor as well, though: possibly<br>the high point of the game is the arrival of the "adventurer," who<br>seems to be you in the Zork trilogy (though it does, sadly, assume<br>that said adventurer is male), and who plays on all the sillinesses of<br>Zork and its genre, from illogical "wonder what happens if I do this"<br>actions and their snappy responses ("The adventurer attempts to eat<br>his sword. I don't think it would agree with him.") to classic<br>vacuum-cleaner adventurer behavior--put the adventurer in a room and<br>watch him pick everything up. In that and in a few select instances--a<br>ludicrously overguarded door, for instance, and the arrival on the<br>scene of the Implementors, meaning the game authors--Infocom manages<br>to get in a few digs at the swords-and-sorcery universe, even while it<br>invokes many of its cliches.<br><br>It's interesting, though, that as a fantasy game, Enchanter plays<br>everything much more conventionally than the Zork series did. The<br>parody elements largely address adventure games themselves, not of the<br>fantasy world; the evil warlock, the good sorcerer, the friendly<br>animals are all reliable fantasy elements, and Enchanter doesn't do<br>much with them--whereas the Zork trilogy derived its humor value from<br>making fun of fantasy itself. The feel, moreover, is less lighthearted<br>than the Zork trilogy (at least, less than I and II; III was a<br>departure in that respect); the adventurer's pratfalls aside, the<br>onset of the "veil of ash" and the way it takes over the game has a<br>sinister quality that doesn't fit well with the humorous<br>aspect. Krill's sidekicks are more menacing than any enemies from the<br>Zork series, since they're not given foibles or funny lines (no lines<br>at all, actually); even when the thief in <a href="z.html#zork1">Zork I</a> was intent on killing<br>you, it was hard to actually be afraid of him because the game took<br>pains to play up the "gentlemanly" aspect. Here, though, when<br>"guttural voices seem to be coming in your direction," there's a<br>genuinely ominous feeling. An early description sets the tone:<br><br>    To the east, far away, can be seen a great castle at the edge of<br>    the Sea.  Three turrets it has; two, old and still majestic, lie<br>    on either side of a third, cold, black as night and squat as a<br>    toad. An evil smoke seems to emanate from this tower, shrouding<br>    the others in a darkening fog. A small mountain trail leaves the<br>    peak and descends to the south into a small village far below.<br><br>Obviously, there isn't a lot that's new here; the ideas and images<br>could have come directly from Tolkien or from one of his<br>imitators. But the writing is restrained enough that these and other<br>atmosphere moments work well--the game builds up to your final<br>encounter with Krill by giving more and more space to the<br>looming-menace aspect. It's hard to explain why it works well, but it<br>does--though you start in a bucolic natural setting, as the game<br>progresses, your discoveries bring you closer to the heart of the<br>castle, and the atmospheric changes are calculated to reflect that<br>progress. Likewise, your accomplishments as an enchanter build on each<br>other: you move from minor triumphs in the beginning to more<br>significant or daring uses of magic later in the game. The point is<br>that Enchanter does quite a lot with a sparely written plot and its<br>few puzzles, and the cliched aspect doesn't prevent the story from<br>being effective.<br><br>On the whole, Enchanter works, and while there are problems--I wish<br>the authors had rethought the insistence on hunger, thirst and sleep,<br>for example--this is an example of one of Infocom's more solid early<br>efforts.  Though it takes a very different approach to its fantasy<br>element than does Zork I, it's no less entertaining for that.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/hints/solutions/enchanter.txt">

The reason you, a near novice, are sent instead of<br>the more powerful mages in charge of you is because Krill (the evil<br>warlock) could easily detect a mage of great power, while you won't even<br>register as a blip on his mental radar screen.  This will supposedly allow<br>you to slip in and defeat him while he's not looking.  The game is set in<br>and around Krill's castle, where there are various traps, tricks, and<br>treasures, not to mention a group of nasty henchmen who carry you off to<br>your death whenever they find you.  The game basically centers around the<br>collection of more and more magical spells to add to your arsenal.  These<br>spells are what enable you to defeat the aforementioned tricks and traps,<br>along with some well-timed help from a few NPC's (including the Adventurer<br>from <a href="z.html#zork1">Zork I</a>, a classic moment if ever there was one!).  Eventually you<br>arrive at the requisite showdown with Krill, who goes down rather easily<br>(somewhat anticlimactic for a world-conquering sorcerer, eh?) <br>Nevertheless, Enchanter is a fun game that will provide you with some hours<br>of enjoyment.<br><br><a href="s.html#sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> is the sequel to Enchanter (obviously) and once again you are<br>called upon to do battle with great evil.  In this case, your mentor Belboz<br>(head of the Circle of Enchanters to which you were admitted after your<br>amazing defeat of Krill) has been captured, imprisoned, and possessed by a<br>malevolent demon, Jeaarr.  Using Belboz's sorcerous powers, the demon will<br>of course be able to ... you guessed it ... take over the world, so off you<br>to the rescue again.  Your quest this time takes you back into the Great<br>Underground Empire, where you will visit an ancient castle, an amusement<br>park, and other locales en route to a showdown with the demon.  Two scenes<br>bear particular mention: the glass maze, which you must navigate in a<br>unique way, shows that not all mazes have to be annoying and boring.  There<br>is another puzzle involving time travel and meeting your "younger"  and<br>"older"  selves which is worth playing the entire game for, as I found it<br>one of the most imaginative and challenging IF puzzles ever.  As a whole,<br>the game is rather easy, but I enjoyed it immensely.  Highly recommended.<br><br><a href="s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</a>, the conclusion of the trilogy, is truly an epic game.  It was<br>Infocom's largest and most ambitious project when it came out, featuring<br>about three times the puzzles (1000 points) of any other Infocom game.  For<br>me, it was love at first sight.  This is one of my all-time absolute<br>favorite games.  It seems that after you rescued Belboz in Sorcerer, you<br>took his place as the Head of the Circle of Enchanters.  Now magic has<br>begun to fail everywhere in the world, and all of your fellow mages have<br>been turned into small amphibians by malevolent sorcery.  You, however, are<br>strangely unaffected, and must pursue the source of this evil.  What you<br>will discover is a game which deals with metaphysics and magic with equal<br>facility, along with challenging puzzles and wonderful writing.  In short,<br>Spellbreaker is a game with almost no equal.  Be warned, however, that it<br>is HARD -- much more so than either of the previous two games in the<br>trilogy.  However, the puzzles are all quite logical, and most involve the<br>intelligent applications of the various spells which you will again find,<br>along with the collection of strange white cubes which when invoked in the<br>proper manner transport you to alternate places and times.  The only thing<br>I didn't like about this game was the inclusion of the ancient "three<br>weighings on a scale"  problem (although it was presented in a novel<br>manner).

VERSION: Release 1

I really liked the first segment of this game. Not only were the animate
objects cool and funny, but the way the player is meant to go about
resolving the situation -- asking everyone about everyone else --
appealed to me much more than if the solution had been to perform some
clever engineering trick. I wasn't quite sure how the stuff I was doing
was getting me any closer to opening the door, but I went along with it
and entered the book...

...and then splat. I didn't get part two at all. I understood how to
manipulate the words -- the hint system told me that much -- but I
didn't have the slightest clue what my goal was, and the hints crapped
out at that point. So I put the game away, figuring I'd give it about a
five. Then I read a solution to part two on the newsgroup -- and I
*still* didn't get it. It was like getting stuck on a puzzle where
you're trying to open a safe and finding out that the combination is
43-49-25... and why? Because it just sort of is. "You turn hard"? Say
what?

And then the third segment... goal, please? I think this says it all:

   &gt;HINT
   There's just some people standing around.

Right. And I was one of them. Maybe there are some people who, presented
with a bunch of playing pieces in a game they don't recognize, would
start messing around with the pieces for hours on end until something
happened; me, I'm more inclined to just leave them alone until I have
some *reason* to play with them, some *objective* I'm using them to try
to accomplish. And "escape" is insufficient. Yes, you do escape, but how
are you supposed to know that X will achieve Y? Doing what the hints
tell you to do with the segments' various playing pieces, and
consequently "escaping," is like the bit in <a href="g.html#good">A GOOD BREAKFAST</a> from Comp97<br>where you're looking for a spoon, happen across a robot, play Lights-Out<br>with it, and then when you win, the robot randomly hands you a spoon as<br>a reward.

You have a gold coin.<br><br>GOOD DESIGN: Get the guard to open the door and let you go free in<br>exchange for the coin.<br><br>BAD DESIGN: Swallow the coin.

In this case, you<br>will see it's "rather high".

I don't know if this was a deliberate stylistic choice,<br>but for me it added to the surreal factor -- and I so enjoy the surreal<br>factor, so this is a good thing.<br><br>Possibly the best use of words was not in the writing itself, but one of<br>the puzzles (see below). Indeed, until that section, I was actually<br>somewhat out-of-sorts with the style presented; as I put it in my notes<br>"This is the kind of HIGH-FALUTIN' High Art thing I dislike, isn't it?"<br>However, it grows on one...<br><br>*** Plot (C+)<br><br>Now, those of you who played this game will be saying "Plot? Was there a<br>PLOT?" Well, yes and no. There was certainly no coherent plot I could<br>identify, but it seems as if each section contained a bit of one, and<br>they were internally consistent. On this basis -- rather than that of<br>understanding and being able to articulate the plot -- I rated it just<br>above average, consistency being one of the building blocks of a good<br>plot. So if you're looking for a full-blown story, I'm afraid you are<br>out of luck; this game does not, so far as I could tell, have one.<br><br>There are basically four (five?) little tableaus that are, at least as<br>far as I could tell, separate, yet each has as its basis understanding<br>or at least discovering the nature of something.

In the interest<br>of leaving -some- surprises to the reader, I shall not reproduce the<br>entire puzzle, but I will say that:<br><br>a) There is more than one (somewhat) sensical "solution", but only one<br>actually -works-<br>b) Yes, it did mean something to ME (though not, I gather, to others).<br><br>Then there was the puzzle with the basically inanimate people.

<a name="enemies">From: Francesco Bova &lt;fbova SP@G pangea.ca&gt;<br>Review appeared in </a><a href="backissues/spag20.html">SPAG #20</a> -- March 15, 2000<br><br>NAME: Enemies<br>AUTHOR: Andy Phillips<br>EMAIL: aphillips SP@G ma.man.ac.uk<br>DATE: January 1999<br>PARSER: Inform<br>SUPPORTS: Z-code (Inform) interpreters<br>AVAILABILITY: Freeware<br>URL: <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/inform/Enemies.z8">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/inform/Enemies.z8</a>

Andy Phillips has a thing for .z8 games. In 3 attempts he's produced 3
REALLY big puzzle-oriented games with varying degrees of success. The
one constant has been that with each successive attempt, he's made great
improvements in terms of both game design and story. Enemies, his most
recent work, doesn't fail to impress in many ways and is certainly more
"user friendly" than his first two offerings. The game chronicles the
life of Charlie Johnson, accountant and every day Joe, who has
unknowingly attracted the attention of an enemy (who it also turns out
is a serial killer). The enemy is a person from Charlie's past who has
been planning to test Charlie's resolve and intelligence for sometime.
The enemy contends that Charlie's had life 'too easy' up until this
point and needs to prove his worth. As an added incentive for Charlie to
participate in the game, his enemy has also kidnapped his girlfriend.
The game is broken into three sections: a prologue section (where
initial bits of Charlie's past are revealed); a main story section
(which revolves around an obstacle course full of puzzles and memories
that take place in Charlie's former college); and an ending section
(where Charlie's enemy is revealed and a final battle ensues). There's
lots of prose to work through here and the puzzles are many and varied.
But with such a cavernous game to review, the question is where do you
start?

Well, let's start with the positives. The best thing about Enemies is
(surprisingly) the atmosphere. I mention the surprise because what had
always impressed me about Phillips' work in the past were his puzzles.
His storytelling conversely had been a little weak. In Enemies, however,
it's his prose that takes the foreground. The writing is generally very
creepy and Phillips does a great job of making the player feel that the
threat is real and around every corner. There were a few instances when
the prose went a little over the top and when it got to be too much it
typically fell into one of these two categories:

Aggravatingly repetitive

   "It's quite easy to get caught up in the world of finance and forget
   about the rest of us unfortunates who never had your chances."
   "I'd like to see you fail for once, Charlie. You think you're a major
   player, but in reality you're just a pawn in a very big game -- and
   it's time to start playing."
   "Imagine having to write your obituary, Charlie. If they had the
   decency to be truthful, they'd say what a heartless creep you were,
   but the ability to lie is second nature to accountants."

   - This is a sample of Charlie's enemy's dialogue, anytime Charlie's
   enemy comes within earshot of Charlie. By the end I felt like saying
   "Alright, either kill me or get some new material because I can't
   keep going on like this!"
                                    OR
Cringe-inducing

   "She never had a chance to say, 'I love you'."

   - Charlie's reaction after discovering his dead fianc&eacute;e. Wait a
   minute, after dating for two years and proposing marriage, she never
   told him she loved him? Boy, that upper lip in England gets stiffer
   every year. :)

But it was worth going through that drivel to get to the little gems
like this one:

   "It's difficult to ascertain an age since wet sandy hair covers most
   of her blistered face, but she can't be much older than twenty. You
   only see her body for a split second before sheer revulsion makes you
   look away, but the details are memorable: ankles bound with strong
   twine, adhesive tape starting to peel off her swollen mouth, tattoos
   of red flowers on her hips."

   - A description of one of your enemy's many victims. Most of the
   victims are done like this and it's quite unsettling when you find
   them within the fondly described rooms of your former college.

Another technique Phillips uses to sustain the atmosphere is the
flashback (which is used when Charlie either gets knocked out or
stumbles onto something that triggers a memory). Through the flashbacks
we learn about Charlie's history - more specifically his college years -<br>and the characters from Charlie's past. The characters are all well done<br>with the usual suspects in full force; we have the bully, the love<br>interest(s), the victim, and Charlie's teachers. From this group, a few<br>suspects with potential motives arise but unfortunately, all of their<br>motives are suspect in turn.<br><br>Phillips tries hard to create tension between Charlie and the other<br>characters with the flashbacks but what the flashbacks really illustrate<br>is that - contrary to his enemy's ravings -- Charlie was a victim for a<br>good part of his college life, and had it anything but easy growing up.<br>If I feel sorry for anyone in this game it IS Charlie. His past would<br>constitute the lead role in any Shakespearean tragedy. In fact, if any<br>character has a motive for vengeance it's him. Did Charlie make mistakes<br>in his life? Sure. But they were very human mistakes and certainly not<br>intentional. That's what makes his enemy's hatred (and through that any<br>of the supporting cast's motives for wanting to kill him) a little<br>unrealistic. Enemies also tries to convey the feeling that it was<br>Charlie's actions that drove his enemy to (amongst other things) serial<br>killing. Given Charlie's past, this too seems flawed.<br><br>Maybe it's the case then that Charlie's enemy is a psychopath, and that<br>Charlie is a casualty of circumstance -- a victim, caught in the wrong<br>place at the wrong time. If this was the author's intent, however, then<br>the story loses a bit of its effectiveness and the game changes from a<br>battle between two masterminds to that of a lowly victim being hunted by<br>a mindless predator. My jury's still out on this because I don't think<br>that was Phillips' intent. At any rate, it ends up being a minor speed<br>bump on the road through a very chilling story.<br><br>As I'd mentioned earlier, the focus of Phillips' games in the past have<br>been his puzzles. He's racked up a few XYZZY puzzle nominations already<br>for some of his previous work and with Enemies he continues to impress.<br>I was reading one of the int-fiction newsgroups a while ago and noticed<br>someone making a comment about Andy Phillips' previous game Heist. Their<br>comment was that in many cases it looked like the plot was being built<br>around the puzzle and not the other way around. I had personally never<br>seen it that way (maybe it's because Heist is one of my favorite games<br>or maybe it's because I've always preferred puzzles to plot), but in<br>retrospect I think the author of the post may have had a point. Enemies<br>improves a bit on Heist in that respect with many of the puzzles<br>centering around different college-related courses including chemistry,<br>mathematics, history, and astronomy. The college section is also capped<br>off with an entertaining macro-puzzle (a spin off of the board game<br>Clue) that brings everything together quite nicely.<br><br>Once you move through the college into the final confrontation with your<br>enemy, there are fairly strict time limits imposed which require a lot<br>of saving and restoring, and in most cases there can't be progress<br>without a little learning by death. I know most players don't view this<br>as a terribly good thing, but in this case I think it supports mimesis.<br>After all, how much time would a serial killer give you if they were<br>intent on killing you? <br><br>The final battle between you and your enemy is also done very well. It<br>involves both offensive and defensive maneuvers as well as some<br>pre-planned setups. I've always been impressed with good fight sequences<br>in IF because getting the timing done correctly and keeping up the<br>player's intensity is considerably more difficult than with a graphical<br>game. <br><br>There were 2 puzzles however that I think might really taint the<br>player's perception of this game. The first one in particular ended up<br>being a point where I know a lot of gamers stopped playing, and it's<br>unfortunate because they miss out on a thrilling finale. Without giving<br>too much detail, the puzzle involves an intricate number of steps where<br>each step has to be performed correctly. If one step is missed, the<br>player gets killed. This sort of thing isn't terribly uncommon in IF but<br>the problem here is that the game doesn't give you any clues as to<br>whether you're on the right track or not. To make matters worse, the<br>puzzle is very complex and requires several boatloads of author<br>telepathy to be done correctly. To finally make this puzzle truly<br>horrible, there is a random element to the puzzle that means never<br>producing the same set of information for the same game so that even<br>after reading the walkthrough, I still had difficulty. In frustration, I<br>had to e-mail the author with my set of data and he had to feed me back<br>the answer. My motivation to play Enemies after completing this puzzle<br>was severely diminished, and it took many moons to get my appetite back.<br><br>Perhaps not as brutal, but equally frustrating was a poorly implemented<br>puzzle revolving around viewing certain pieces of evidence and then<br>confronting your enemy with their existence. Although I did see all the<br>necessary evidence, I never managed to make the connection that I had to<br>see it all in the same saved game, and thus was killed immediately when<br>my enemy confronted me. I actually figured out the enemy's identity<br>early on in the game because of a subtle hint in one of the puzzles (in<br>fact, it was so subtle it may have been inadvertent), so not being able<br>to confront my enemy with the evidence made this puzzle even more<br>frustrating. <br><br>These were my two main sticking points with the puzzles but there were<br>also a few minor problems with the parser, and some guess-the-verb<br>problems. The problems were so minor, in fact, that they might not even<br>be worth mentioning, but I think I will because I've noticed that these<br>particular problems are quite common in bigger games. There were<br>instances where I had a vague idea as to what I was supposed to do, but<br>the solutions revolved around non-standard Inform actions (i.e., throw<br>(x) over (y), put (x) under (y)). In a game like this, it's tough enough<br>trying to figure out what to do when you're armed with a stable of<br>common Inform verbs, but throw some "not-so-obvious" ones in there, and<br>things get exponentially more difficult. A suggestion to remedy this<br>problem might be to include a piece in the INFO section detailing all<br>the verbs that can be used in the game. A good example of how to do this<br>is Jon Ingold's 1999 release, and similarly puzzle-oriented game, The<br>Mulldoon Legacy. Ingold lists all the potential commands in the game in<br>a special section in the help menu and this makes a very difficult game<br>puzzle-wise, much more enjoyable. Ingold also makes a comment in the<br>help section of his game that guessing what verbs to use shouldn't be<br>part of the puzzle. I tend to agree with him, especially in this case,<br>because Enemies would still be sufficiently hard with a comprehensive<br>verb list. <br><br>There, that's my last squabble with the puzzles. The truth is that there<br>were at least two or three puzzles in this game that could easily be<br>nominated for XYZZY awards, and the sense of satisfaction I got from<br>completing most of them was very high. A recommendation might be to play<br>this game with a walkthrough close by, and when you hit one of the<br>killer puzzles (believe me you'll know when it happens), you can save<br>both your gaming experience and yourself the grief of trying to plow<br>through them.<br><br>The ending as I'd mentioned is really well done but one last thing sort<br>of irked me. If you finish the game with a full point score, you're<br>awarded the rank of "Man of Little Merit". Not that I'm sure Charlie<br>ever had anything to prove, but if he did, he at least proved that he<br>was worthy of life. Not a big deal, but it left a bad taste in my mouth<br>when I finished.<br><br>All gripes aside, Enemies is a fine game and for those of you who like<br>puzzle-heavy games that don't completely sacrifice plot, this may be one<br>to download.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/Enemies.z8">

and difficult.  In a competition with several of them, Enlightenment
stands out as the most accomplished: there is a certain unity to the
puzzles that justifies the one-room framework, and they are difficult
enough to tax the player's mental energy, even within the confines of
the room.

The game also features a take-off on the Infocom "feelies" of old,
with an HTMLized excerpt from Popular Enchanting and several silly but
amusing tidbits. The excerpt reproduces the goofball feel of the
Infocom manuals, and fits with the game's persistent tweaking of
Activision (the darkness is inhabited by g***s, notably, and being
eaten by one is "both g***ling and g***some"). (The prologue also
refers to Frobozz Magic Napalm and a Frobozz Magic Tinning Kit, so
there's not much ambiguity about who we're imitating.) The game blends
traditional fantasy elements with anachronistic bits like
battery-operated appliances in a way that likewise recalls Infocom;
one of the familiar objects is a aerosol can of g*** repellent.

The puzzles, though the solutions are sometimes silly enough to recall
Steve Meretzky, would qualify as among Infocom's more difficult:
several turn on realizing the physical properties of some of the
objects you're holding, properties not at all obvious to the
unscientifically minded. Still, the puzzles are inventive and require
some lateral thinking--and some combining of objects in several
cases--to solve; the difficulty stems less from unfairness or obscure
facts than from the one-object or one-property conventions of most IF
puzzles. The real fly in the ointment is the hint system, which seems
badly broken--one must go through the hints for the concept of the
game as a whole in order to get to those for specific puzzles, whether
or not one has already grasped the goal. There may be a reason for
that--the headings for the individual puzzles might give the game away
for the player who hasn't picked up the point yet--but surely there
must be a way to avoid that problem without such a maladaptive
system. At any rate, in a game this difficult, the hint system is
essential--and beyond the initial glitch, the system works well.

The plot--at least, what can be revealed here--is simple enough: at
the end of a cave-crawl hack-and-slash fantasy quest, you have to
cross a bridge guarded by a troll. Therein lies the excuse for giving
you an inventory full of sundry objects, presumably, which makes
possible difficult and complicated puzzles. But the way you go about
getting rid of the troll is more inventive than the premise suggests,
and suggests an ironic reversal of one of the adventurer's commonplace
tasks. Likewise implied is a jab at the interchangeability of fantasy
quests, since the quest as a whole is clearly generic; you never find
out, after all, what you were after in the first place. The joke, of
course, is that the game sprinkles offhand references to other things
you've already encountered in your quest, as if the premise were
actually worth developing, more than an excuse for the one-room
problem.

Enlightenment is a short but extremely solid game: the puzzles are
challenging enough that solving them feels rewarding. If it feels less
like a game than a small section of a larger game, that's presumably
the intent, and while it might be more satisfying to play a full-blown
game, this sort of entry is ideal for the competition. With enough
Infocom references to make fans nostalgic, and some of the feel of
early Infocom, Enlightenment is an unabashed puzzle-fest that boasts
some of the competition's toughest problems. It does what it does well
enough that I gave it a 9 in the competition.

Review appeared in <a href="backissues/spag17.html">SPAG #17</a> -- May 10, 1999<br><br>What is it with all the one-room games this year? There must be some<br>kind of movement happening in the collective IF unconscious which says<br>"Plot?  Who needs it? Give me one room, and as long as it's got one or<br>more puzzles in it, I'm happy." Well, sometimes I'm happy too. And,<br>more or less, this is one of those times. Despite its title,<br>Enlightenment has very little to do with gaining awareness or<br>understanding Zen koans. To say what it *does* have to do with would<br>probably be a bit too much of a spoiler, but it involves deliberately<br>placing yourself in a situation that most text adventurers would avoid<br>at all costs. Because of this, it took me a little while to actually<br>catch on to how the game is supposed to work -- I just couldn't<br>believe that deliberately placing myself in danger was the right<br>path. It is, though, and getting there is all the fun. Like last<br>year's <a href="z.html#zero">Zero Sum Game</a>, Enlightenment puts the PC at the *end* of an<br>adventure of dizzying proportions. Unlike Zero Sum Game, Enlightenment<br>isn't really an unwinding of the PC's accomplishments -- you get to<br>keep your score, and even increase it. You've already overcome dozens<br>of obstacles, collected lots of treasures, and scored 240 points out<br>of 250; now there's just the little matter of getting past a canonical<br>troll bridge and scurrying out of the caverns with your loot.

In fact, as you can see<br>from the above quote, the game actually features some familiar parts<br>of the Zork universe, such as Frobozz Magic products, rat-ants, and<br>even certain slavering lurkers in dark corners. Activision apparently<br>granted permission for this usage, as they did for David Ledgard in<br>his adaptation of the <a href="p.html#planet">Planetfall</a> sample transcript for his game Space<br>Station. Activision's willingness to grant permissions for such usage,<br>as well as their donation of prizes to the competition and their<br>sometime inclusion of hobbyist IF on commercial products, is great<br>news for a fan community like ours -- their support of IF means that<br>more people will devote their time to it, resulting (hopefully) in<br>more and more good games. Enlightenment is one of the good ones, and<br>one of its best features is its writing. Another way in which it is<br>unlike Zero Sum Game is that it doesn't take an extreme or harsh tone.<br>Instead, the writing is almost always quite funny in both its comments<br>on text adventure cliches (the FULL score listing is a scream) and its<br>usage of them. The game is littered with footnotes, which themselves<br>are often littered with footnotes.

This kind of mood-building file has been<br>included with a few competition games this year, and Enlightenment's<br>extras are definitely the best of the bunch. The writing in the faux<br>magazine is just as good as the writing in the game, and the graphics<br>look sharp and professional. I like these little extras -- they really<br>do help set the mood of a game -- and they definitely add to the fun<br>of Enlightenment.<br><br>The one problem I had with this game was that, although the writing is<br>funny and clever, it is sometimes not precise enough to convey the<br>exact nature of a puzzle or its solution. In a heavily puzzle-oriented<br>game like Enlightenment, this can be a major setback. For example, at<br>one point in the game you're called upon to cut something, but it<br>won't work to use your sword on it. You must find something else to<br>cut with. Well, there is something else, but that object is never<br>described as having a sharp edge. This is one of those puzzles that<br>made me glad I looked at the hints -- the only way I would have ever<br>gotten it is by brute force, and that's no fun anyway.

VERSION: Release 1 (competition version)

Never judge a book (virtual or otherwise) by its title I told myself as
I opened up the game. I might be a scientist who thinks chemistry is the
best subject on the planet, but a title like "Episode In The Life Of An
Artist" does not necessarily mean an arty, poetic, puzzleless offering.

The opening scene is a bedroom, which could have been instantly
sleep-inducing for the player. Luckily, I was fascinated by the author's
choice of quotations and continued. Exploring led me into a pretty
run-of-the-mill dressing sequence but at least I wasn't trapped in one
room waiting to discover the magic command that would open up the game.
And the kitchen was fun for a few turns.

A possibly frustrating time is encountered outside the house but it
doesn't defeat the intellect to find the key to moving the action along.
Entertainment is provided while this section is unfolding its vital
pieces of information.

And then -- suddenly -- the game began to grow on me. Almost against my
will. There is a wonderful sequence after the PC reaches the main game
destination, which speaks volumes about his pernickety attention to
dress code. The timing is exactly right and the PC's shock at the event
is an enduring memory.

Yes, there are bugs. Yes, there are times when starting again is the
only thing to do. The game still managed to overcome my irritation at
its implementation and logic gaps. It made me want to finish. I'm glad I
did, because the final screens are worth the playing time by themselves.

Review appeared in <a href="backissues/spag35.html">SPAG #35</a> -- December 31, 2003<br><br>I really enjoyed playing Peter Eastman's entry in the IFComp, "Episode<br>in the Life of an Artist." This is largely because game contains many<br>references to and is in the style of other works that I have enjoyed.<br>After playing the first section, I nearly quit and moved on to the next<br>game on my list, but I was completely hooked by the second. The game's<br>tone is much lighter than many other of the games in the comp, it's<br>playable in 2 hours, and it's fun. <br> <br>The story starts with the character in bed with the alarm buzzing. The<br>remainder of the initial section is concerned with getting cleaned up,<br>dressed and ready for work. This part is a little dull but serves to<br>introduce the character.

At first this is a bit jarring but<br>it is a relief not be required to, for instance, find the bus stop,<br>right bus, etc.<br><br>The setting is a skewed version of the intersection between the here and<br>now, <a href="z.html#zorktril">Zork</a>, and Daniel Pinkwater universes, with bits of others mixed in.<br>Included in the Zork references is a mention of a "five zorkmid bill"<br>being in the character's wallet. Usually the references to the Zork<br>universe take the form of similar items or locations. On the Pinkwater<br>side, several his books contain variations on the chicken man. His<br>appearance in this game kept me playing when I was just about to quit<br>and move on to the next entry to be judged. More than the chicken man<br>has the Pinkwater vibe. The structure of the story, its simple and<br>childlike main character, and the strange characters/machines/job are<br>all common Pinkwater elements. Also included are nods to <a href="h.html#hitch">HHTG</a>, and<br>likely a few more that I missed. <br><br>At the end of some movies while the credits are being shown, outtakes<br>from the filming are shown as well.

One kind of r*if post I hate (one of many) is the "IF reference at
dingbats.com!" variety, where I'm meant to be grateful because some badly-drawn 
comic strip has mentioned a grue on panel 3, or some blog has posted an 
"amusing" "satirical" IF transcript, which has all your favourite commands, 
from &gt;XYZZY to &gt;FROTZ LANTERN, but never my favourite command, which is &gt;QUIT. 
As you might gather, I'm never excited by this kind of exposure; it invariably 
tends to reinforce old stereotypes about the form, playing to a gallery that 
associates IF with dungeon crawls, treasure hunts, mazes and magic words. In 
the unlikely event that anyone's interest is piqued by such stuff, they'll come 
to r*if expecting more of the same.

A recent example of mainstream IF exposure is Eragon, a zcode dungeon crawl 
apparently based on a book of the same name by Christopher Paolini (and because 
it's hosted on his official site with no other attribution, he'll have to take 
the blame for the game as well). Eragon takes its game design cues from the 
homebrewed BASIC Zork knock-offs that padded out coverdisks in the 80s, and so, 
true to form, we have a maze, we have parser problems, we have guess-the-verb 
for every puzzle, we have laughably static NPCs, and we have bad, bad writing.

"A bundle lays wrapped at his feet", we are told early on, and further 
occurrences of the same error reveal that the writer really does think "to lay" 
means "to lie". He splices pleonasms together with commas, writing "to the east 
stands a crude tent, the source of the singing comes from within it" instead of 
"the singing comes from a crude tent to the east." In fact, the prose is 
littered with so many grammatical, spelling and formatting errors that I can 
begin to appreciate why the novel took a year in the writing, and two years in 
the editing. That said, I hope the game was written by some deluded fanboy and 
not by Paolini himself. If this is anything like the published novel, then I'm 
amazed it ever got out of the slushpile. 

Eragon's setting and story are the miserable third pressings of Tolkien, with 
the ancient dwarf stronghold Khazad-D&ucirc;m -- sorry, "Farthen D&ucirc;r" -- coming under 
attack by orcs -- sorry, "Urgals". It's the kind of place where all the proper 
names suffer from Klingonitis, being peppered with glottal stops and random 
diacriticals. The exception is the incongruous "Angela", an unmoving herbalist 
who is clearly supposed to be a bit of a character, but just repeats the same 
screen-long infodump every time I talk to her. The PC is entirely without 
character and the dungeon is entirely without atmosphere, a state not helped by 
the presence of rooms called "Maze M3" and "Hallway H19". "The northern wall 
appears to be a mycologist's dream!" we are told at one stage, which is an odd 
coincidence, because the rest of the game is a proctologist's dream.

As a game, Eragon is less than worthless, but I suppose the real issue is 
whether it's likely to encourage new people to check out the IF community. On 
balance, I don't think I'd like r*if to be overrun with consumers of EFP, but 
Eragon offers little danger of that. There are no links to the IF community on 
the site, and no credit is given to the development system, only to some 
mysterious and unnamed "open source technology". The Inform banner has been 
hacked away from the start, but the undocumented &gt;SCRIPT ON reveals the game to 
have been written in Inform 6.3. (This also reveals the game to have been 
released in debug mode, so that I can solve one puzzle with &gt;PURLOIN -- my 
other favourite command.) Given the number of default responses left in, a 
chunk of the game's text is actually by Graham Nelson; but rather than 
acknowledge a debt, the game prefers to hide the competition. A dishonest 
strategy, but no doubt the only profitable one when you've got such a duff 
product!

"Surreal" games are, at worst, collections of random locations and
characters, each included only for its puzzle value, held together by a
tenuous framework. Sometimes these games are classified as surreal only
because they're so random, and sometimes the author uses the surrealism
as an excuse to avoid having to make things make any sense. Some of the
very earliest text adventures fell into this category: locations with no
conceivable connection were often juxtaposed, and pointless anachronisms
abounded. And after the success of Myst, graphical adventure designers
cranked out lots of bad surreal games; it's even arguable that Myst is
one of them, although it at least made an effort to justify its
contrived settings. 

At their best, surreal games are just as self-consistent as realistic
games, but take place in fantastic settings with their own rules:
different laws of physics, perhaps, or different rules of social
interaction. Brian Moriarty's <a href="t.html#trinity">Trinity</a> was probably the first adventure<br>to meet this standard, and to many people is still the best surreal<br>adventure game ever written. <br><br>Erehwon is probably not going to unseat Trinity as the benchmark surreal<br>adventure, but it's another fine example. The game takes place in a kind<br>of meta-universe where different parallel universes can be connected<br>according to complicated rules. The plot is minimal - you have to<br>collect a number of objects so that you can take part in a role-playing<br>game (which is, it turns out, a role-playing version of the text<br>adventure). The setting, though, is varied and detailed, and richly<br>imagined. <br><br>Erehwon is an unabashedly puzzle-oriented game. Most of its puzzles are<br>reasonable and fair, although a good many are pretty tough. And there<br>are lots of them; the game has five major puzzles, which involve<br>collecting five objects, but each of these has a number of sub-puzzles<br>that must be solved first. The number and difficulty of the puzzles<br>makes the game daunting as a competition entry; within the time limit, I<br>only managed to make it about two-thirds of the way through the game,<br>even after making extensive use of hints. <br><br>Fortunately, the game has an excellent hint system. Hints are delivered<br>incrementally, so it's possible to get a little bit of help and still<br>feel like you did most of the work. The hint system is<br>context-sensitive, and offers hints only on puzzles that are currently<br>accessible, which avoids giving away upcoming events by showing topics<br>too early. <br><br>This game is large, with lots of things to see and lots to do. It's also<br>very ambitious in its mechanics; for example, it has a movement system<br>that lets the player mix compass directions with relative movement. All<br>of this works; the game is technically dazzling. <br><br>If it hadn't been for the hint system, I probably wouldn't have made<br>much progress in the game, and I would have thought it was far too<br>difficult. With the hint system, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the game's<br>clever construction and detailed, imaginative world. <br><br>Score: 8 (clever and amusing, well-implemented) <br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition99/tads/erehwon">

VERSION: IF Comp Release

This is one of those stories where you have to get to the end to fully
understand what's going on at the beginning, so I won't say anything
about the storyline except that it was interesting throughout, and the
ending satisfying. Otherwise, I'll limit my comments to the work's more
technical aspects.

This game falls into the puzzle-free category, where a lot of authors
have focused their efforts in the past few years, especially for
Competition games. In overall form, this one is fairly typical of the
category: very little inventory, a small number of locations with lots
of detail, and well-developed characters. Puzzle-free games vary in
their degree of interactivity; at one extreme, you just sit there and
press the space bar to get to the next chunk of text, and at the other
you do more or less the same things you'd do in a more traditional game,
but never encounter any locked doors or other obstacles. "Eric's Gift"
is at the latter end of the spectrum; it even uses the traditional
ASK/TELL conversational system, rather than one of the more constrained
systems often seen in puzzle-free works.

Conversation is a big part of this game, and it's handled quite well. I
usually don't like ASK/TELL very much as a conversation system, because
it's so artificial: in real life, you never just walk up to random
people and start unceremoniously peppering them with questions -- and if
you did, they wouldn't just answer as though they'd been standing there
all day waiting for you. There's an ebb and flow to a real conversation,
and a certain amount of protocol for initiating and terminating one.

"Eric's Gift" does a couple of things to make its ASK/TELL style of
conversations seem much more natural. First, each question is narrated:
when you type an ASK ABOUT command, the story puts your question into
the narration:

    &gt;ASK BOB ABOUT LANTERN
    "Do you know how to work this thing?" you ask Bob, holding up
    the lantern.

    Bob takes a look at it.  "You probably need a new battery."

This game didn't invent this technique, certainly, but it works well
here. It's surprising that more games don't use this device, because
it's simple to implement and a big improvement over the traditional
style of showing only the other character's response. Some people
complain that narrating a question puts words into the player's mouth;
but in a game that distinguishes the player from the player character,
it's actually putting words in the player character's mouth, which is a
different matter. And anyway, there's some implication of words in the
PC's mouth no matter what: it's not as though the PC is literally meant
to say simply "LANTERN?" That's part of what feels artificial about
unnarrated questions; clearly the PC is meant to be posing a question in
some normal conversational form, so it's weird to omit it from the
narration. For authors who can't get past the words-in-mouth thing,
perhaps you could at least narrate the fact that a question was asked --
just something like "You ask Bob about the lantern"; this would serve as
the ASK ABOUT equivalent of the simple acknowledgment that a command
like TAKE or DROP would get.

The second conversation technique this story uses is to establish a
certain amount of context to each conversation. One of the things that
usually makes ASK/TELL feel unnatural is the way you walk up to an NPC
who's never seen your character before and ask a question, and the
response makes it sound as though you're an old friend and you'd been
gabbing for half an hour already. Why would the NPC just answer, rather
than asking who the heck are you and what's with the scuba get-up? This
game is different; each conversation has a clear starting point,
establishing that we're engaged in conversation for subsequent queries.
This allows a certain amount of normal conversational protocol to be
observed. The game also arranges things so that once a conversation has
begun, it stays the focus of the interactivity for a while, further
enhancing the sense of an ongoing conversation. The game accomplishes
this largely through a limited physical setting, so there's not a lot to
do other than continue conversing -- which works well here, but it
obviously wouldn't be appropriate for every game. Despite the limits on
the PC's options during conversations, I never had the sense of being
tied to a chair; the limits are subtle and gentle, since they're
presented as motivational rather than physical constraints.

In sum, this is a well-implemented piece of puzzleless IF with an
interesting story. It doesn't break extensive new technical ground, as
it mostly relies (with fairly good results) on techniques that have been
developed in other puzzle-free works over the past few years; its
conversational system does have some subtle refinements that are worth
looking at, though.

VERSION: Competition release

I came away from this game feeling I would forgive the author anything.
Although I'm a non-fan of MUDs -- from which the game derives
inspiration -- the opening pulled me in. I am not aware of visualising
in any conscious way normally but such a vivid image was conjured by the
opening description that I laughed out loud. This (more than any other
piece in the competition) reminded me of the heady days when we queued
to pay money for adventure games. A time when whole weeks were lost
fighting with puzzles and resisting hints from coded clues in the back
of the manual.

I loved the way situations had multiple and logical solutions. It was
compulsive in a self-assessing way because you just had to find out
which sect fitted you best. I also loved the way doors disappeared
behind you as new areas were entered. I was left in no doubt that I
should go forward with the equipment in my current inventory. No
fifty-move treks across the map to retrieve an essential object
discarded earlier.

The central puzzle was a perfect struggle of my intellect against the
Maester. I was meant to prove myself and the contrived game world became
perfectly believable to me. So what do I need to forgive the author for?
Only that The Erudition Chamber ended much, much too soon. I would have
happily continued through another five or six tests. Bravo!

The reason I wanted to review this old game was that I have a very
special attachment to it since it was the very first text adventure I've
ever played. The story to that is actually quite sad. I got a package
about five years ago that contained some game collection titled 'Big
100' that actually contained 100 games in five floppy disks. Well, we
can all imagine the quality of these wonderful gaming experiences, but
there was this game titled Pulsar 7. All of the other games were graphic
games except this one and when I started the game, I was hooked. I
thought it was a revolutionary idea! No graphics, just text! Brilliant,
why hadn't anyone else thought of this before!? That was the thing I
wondered for about two years without even noticing that the game was
released in 1983.

Well, enough of my sad story about my first contact with text
adventures. I was supposed to review the game, not myself...

In Infocom masterpieces collection, G. Kevin Wilson wrote that the
reason text adventures still keep a good amount of players and
programmers, is because of the stories. Well, this game proves that you
can write a text adventure without much story to back it up. Of course,
the game is not very good. In the game, you are the only survivor of the
galactic freighter Pulsar 7. Apparently, a group of monsters have
boarded the ship and eaten everyone else. Now you have to save the
character from the ship full of aliens who have an urge to tear you to
pieces. Now, this must've been a really original idea in 1983 with only
about couple of million other games using a similar concept.

As far as actual gameplay, it's at about the same level as the creative
force behind the story. The screen tells you where you are without any
description. Then follows a list of the items you can see. About half of
these are totally useless and you can't even examine them since the
parser is at a complete loss if you try to examine those. For example,
in the very beginning of the game I can see a warning sign. I wanted to
see if the warning sign contained any text, but I couldn't do that since
the parser does not understand what 'warning' means.

After the list of items follows a list of exits. There is a significant
problem there. In the very beginning of the game, the game says that
'Exit: SOUTH WEST'. I spent the better part of my childhood trying to
get to southwest. What I failed to realise was that you can go south OR
west, not southwest. This was of course my fault as well, but a bit
clearer way of presenting things would not hurt.

The parser's level is about the same in all situations. There seems to
be only one way of presenting the game with ideas, and unfortunately
that way has nothing to do with English grammar. At the time it was
really hard for me since I am from Finland and English is not my primary
language, so the parser's total failure to understand words like 'to',
'the', or 'a' brought me great difficulties. These days I don't have
that problem, but sometimes still it gives me difficulties to make
sentences that the program would understand. For example, commands like
'use key door' are hard for me when 'to' would come naturally. Then
again, commands like 'unlock door' or 'use key' are out of the question
since the parser fails to understand those too. In the latter case you
would get a message like this:

   It is no use trying to use
   KEY

Well, as I found out, the parser doesn't understand even 'use key door',
because that would result a message like this:

   It is no use trying to use
   KEY DOOR

So 'use key door' doesn't work either, but it's a good example of the
language you have to use in the game. The parser seems to have a
language of its own and some of the basic commands we're accustomed to
using in interactive fiction are completely useless as the parser does
not understand them. That makes the gameplay really hard, especially to
someone like me who have only just found the joy of playing text
adventures and who is totally helpless in all of them. For example, the
parser does not understand the 'look' command. In some games, the 'look'
command would work the same way as the 'examine' command except that
it's a lot shorter to write. In this game, you have to write the
'examine' command over and over again. If the 'look' command would have
different function than the 'examine' command, I would understand that,
but it's really hard to understand why there is no 'look' command at
all.

The danger of the game is to fall asleep. If you do, a MUTANT CREATURE
rips your head off and the game makes it clear that 'I have landed
myself right in to MANURE this time!!'. Maybe it is the best to let the
game stay in there and try to forget it as soon as possible.

JJ Guest writes, &ldquo;I began writing Escape from the Crazy Place when I was
thirteen years old, and have now finally finished it, aged thirty-six. In spite
of this I still haven't the slightest idea of what it's about.&rdquo;  And how.

I can only imagine that the vast stretch of time was spent on the technical
details of adapting the game to the parser, as the admittedly bug-free play
reads like something written by a 13 year old.  The game opens with an NPC
hamburger vending clown named Donald McRonald who eventually &ldquo;takes two fingers
and stuffs them up your nostrils for a joke,&rdquo; and it deteriorates from there.
The play, the &ldquo;puzzles&rdquo; (such as they are) and the illustrations are simple,
sophomoric and pointless.

If this sort of humor is your cup of tea, have at it; it&rsquo;s the only thing
Escape From the Crazy Place has going for it.  If on the other hand you find it
as irritating and unfunny as I do, you&rsquo;d be well advised to give it a pass.

VERSION: 1

An Escape to Remember is a "Chinese Whispers / Telephone" style interactive 
piece, written by 14 different authors each of whom only saw the preceding 
section of the game.  Needless to say, this makes for a very schizophrenic story 
line.  That said, and perhaps in spite of itself, it's quite fun to play. 

The story starts out with a timed puzzle with a sort of secret agent / escape 
from a locked room premise and ultimately morphs into a surreal, almost Roger 
Zelazny finish.  In turns it's easy, difficult, serious, silly, well written, 
juvenile, buggy and error free.

Unless I'm mistaken at least some of the authors fudged the premise.  There's a 
segment about mid-game that incorporates a return to a much earlier module, many 
sections are seamless enough that the transitions between what in retrospect are 
probably multiple authors is not obvious, and some puzzles incorporated a 
similar style of solution that charitably might be dismissed as inherent to the 
insular nature of IF but which in reality likely came from some "against the 
rules" cribbing.  To be fair, I suppose that this could also be attributed to 
some clean-up after the fact to improve playability.

I did run into some trouble in the earliest part of the game, before I 
understood that objects collected in a previous module could be employed in the 
subsequent one.  Of course, I then had the PC toting a huge number of red 
herrings from module to module, not wanting to drop the ones I (correctly) 
suspected as useless out of apprehension that I would not be able to backtrack 
and collect them had they been needed.

The best puzzles required some thought, several objects and multiple steps taken 
in the correct order to solve.  Others were almost irritatingly easy, leaving 
only the most obvious course of action as a solution.  The modules involving 
them might have been more compelling and memorable had a little bit more 
"challenge" been built in. 

Players should be aware that there is one particular puzzle in about the first 
third of the game that, as far as I could tell, can only be solved by trial and 
error, with the results of an unsuccessful trial putting the game in an 
unwinnable state.  To my way of thinking, the "Undo" or "Restore" commands have 
no place in the routine solving of an IF puzzle and I was more than a little bit 
disappointed in the author of this section for forcing this.

There are some bugs.  Some modules have minor, annoying but ultimately 
irrelevant syntax bugs.  For example, the PC might run across a "Mauve Paisley 
Grip":

> Open Mauve

You can't see any such thing.

> Open Paisley

You can't see any such thing.

> Open Grip

You can't see any such thing.

> Open Mauve Paisley Grip

Opened.

Or

>Read paper

Nothing is written on the paper.

>X paper

Written on the paper is the Gettysburg Address.

The buggiest are two modules involving a subterranean railroad - I found it 
possible to pick up a location as though it were an object, large objects that 
require the PC to drop everything else in inventory can be placed inside 
containers and lifted without such restriction, and I was able to search the 
contents of a container held by an NPC before obtaining possession of the 
container itself.  None of these bugs made the game unplayable but they're the 
sort of thing that should have been caught and fixed before release.  I might 
also add that the buggy sections were redeemed at least in part by some of the 
best, most entertaining and richest writing of the game.

Despite the inherent continuity problems in such a format I enjoyed playing An 
Escape to Remember.  Although there were flaws there were also some good puzzles 
and entertaining mini-plots which definitely made play worthwhile in spite of 
the more uneven bits.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 5.5 to 6 for difficulty 
and a 6.5 to 7 overall.

VERSION: 1.0

This game reminded me of "<a href="p.html#planet">Planetfall</a>", which is probably inevitable for<br>a story about escaping a spaceship on the verge of destruction.<br>"Evacuate" is hardly a Planetfall clone: the plots and settings are<br>really only similar to the extent that they both start on spaceships in<br>urgent need of evacuation, and there's nothing in this game that's<br>directly borrowed from Planetfall. Even so, there are stylistic<br>influences here and there that brought Planetfall to mind while playing.<br><br>The plot is that the player character has to escape a spaceliner that's<br>been attacked by an enemy ship and is rapidly falling apart. The PC has<br>somehow slept through the attack, and by the time he wakes up, everyone<br>else has already left the ship via escape pods. Not surprisingly, the<br>damage the ship has sustained makes it more difficult to escape, since<br>some escape routes are blocked by rubble, and many of the ship's systems<br>are no longer operating properly.<br><br>The story and setting are perfect for a traditional puzzle-solving<br>adventure: the scene of a disaster is naturally full of physical<br>challenges, and the science fiction setting means that virtually any<br>kind of machine or device is fair game for mechanical puzzles. The game<br>doesn't squander this advantage: it does a great job of developing<br>story-driven puzzles, and virtually every goal is based on overcoming<br>some obstacle to escape created by the damage to the ship. Most of the<br>puzzles involve machinery that would be plausibly in the player<br>character's path of escape. Only a few puzzles feel deliberately<br>contrived as puzzles; the worst of these is a maze, which has a<br>relatively interesting gimmick as mazes go but still sticks out as<br>highly contrived.<br><br>(Actually, I'm probably being far too easy on this maze; because of the<br>competition's time constraints, I was already using the walk-through by<br>the time I reached it, so I didn't even try to figure out the maze on my<br>own. If I had tried, I would probably not be so dispassionate. The<br>maze's gimmick is interesting, but it's not one of those gimmicks that<br>lets you bypass the drudgery of brute-force mapping with a flash of<br>insight; on the contrary, it's one of those gimmicks that requires you<br>to have the flash of insight before you can even start on the drudgery<br>part. If I hadn't already been using the walk-through, this maze would<br>undoubtedly have sent me straight to it, and I undoubtedly would have<br>few kind words to say about it.)<br><br>Even though the puzzles are integrated well into the story, many of<br>their solutions seem arbitrary. There are two ways for a puzzle to make<br>sense: before you solve it, or after. In the latter category, a puzzle<br>can make perfect sense after you know the solution, but only because the<br>solution contains information that helps explain the logic, or because<br>it wasn't clear until after solving the puzzle that it was a puzzle in<br>the first place. This kind of puzzle isn't as bad as the kind that makes<br>no sense at all, but it can still seem arbitrary, since there's no way<br>to explain why the player character, within the context of the story,<br>would have thought to do the right thing. This is the kind of puzzle<br>that seems to occur many times in this game.<br><br>Two things are lacking in many of this game's puzzles: hinting, and<br>motivation. A few puzzles would be much more fair if they provided a<br>hint when the player tried doing something close to the right thing; in<br>one place, for example, we have to use a fairly unusual command to open<br>something, but using a plain OPEN command doesn't give any encouraging<br>feedback. The OPEN command should respond with an explanation of why the<br>object can't be opened directly; this would suggest that opening the<br>object is the right idea, but we need to figure out how. As it is, the<br>response to OPEN merely suggests that the object isn't openable at all.<br>Other puzzles simply had syntax that was too specific; for example, in<br>one situation we must DIG IN something to move it, but none of MOVE,<br>TAKE, PUSH, or PULL have any effect on the object.<br><br>The game's writing is quite good. It's especially above par for a<br>puzzle-oriented game, since authors of such games tend to put a lot more<br>effort into the puzzles than into the writing. The setting is especially<br>well described; the locations are richly imagined and described in great<br>detail, and are implemented to substantial depth as well. I greatly<br>enjoyed exploring the early parts of the setting; it was sort of sad<br>that the ship was being destroyed, since it would have been fun just to<br>explore it more.<br><br>I have a small complaint about the pacing of the plot. Despite the<br>obvious urgency of the situation, there's no real *feeling* of urgency<br>to the player character's actions. If you just wander around the ship<br>doing nothing, the supposedly critical situation doesn't deteriorate one<br>iota. Now, I'm not suggesting that I'd prefer the game to have a timer<br>forcing you to complete certain tasks in a certain number of moves; that<br>would only make the game mechanics too obvious by forcing the player to<br>constantly save and restore, which for me destroys any sense of<br>immersion by reducing the story to a puzzle-box to be taken apart and<br>solved. Nonetheless, it's strange in this particular story that, despite<br>the blaring klaxons and piles of rubble everywhere, the setting is<br>completely static, and doesn't change except in response to the player<br>character's actions. I don't have a lot of suggestions for how to<br>improve this; it's difficult in interactive fiction to invest<br>time-critical situations with a real sense of urgency without either<br>putting the game firmly on rails or killing the PC, neither of which I<br>like. In this particular game, I think it might make a big difference if<br>the ship at least felt like it was falling apart in real time, by<br>showing some locations to grow noticeably worse as the game proceeds.<br>The deterioration need not be life-threatening or alter the course of<br>the plot; a new pile of rubble could appear in a hallway, for example,<br>making the hallway harder to pass but still passable.<br><br>I enjoyed the writing and detailed setting of this game. Given the<br>two-hour Competition judging time limit, I had to consult the<br>walk-through, so I didn't get the full effect of solving all of the<br>puzzles. My sense, though, is that many of the puzzles are quite<br>difficult by virtue of being rather arbitrary; however, they're probably<br>no more so than in a lot of other adventures, so people who enjoy<br>solving hard adventure game puzzles might find this a good challenge.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2002/tads2/evacuate">

VERSION: Release 2.1

Everybody Loves a Parade manages a difficult feat: it's an enjoyable
and rewarding game in its own right, whose puzzles take real thought,
but it also essays an important innovation in IF playing style and
carries it off brilliantly. That innovation will not be revealed here,
as the surprise is part of the value of the innovation and giving it
away would spoil the fun for future players, but I know I was
thoroughly caught off guard at a certain point late in the game. On
the face of it, that development is only a small part of the game and
its effect on gameplay is minimal--but when players who have completed
the game remember it, I think it is safe to say that one particular
moment, more than any other, will remain with them. At first, I
questioned the author's judgment in engineering the moment in the way
he did--but eventually decided that his approach, more than any other
(well, aside from similar strategies), grabbed the reader's attention.

The plot is entertaining and reasonably original. You are an engineer
sent across the country to start a new job, but you bog down in the
wilds of Arizona with almost no gas, stuck behind a parade for a "rock
festival"--and no, Janis Joplin is not in town. The events that ensue
are engagingly cartoony; though most of the parade elements amount to
amusing but irrelevant sideshows, the silliness adds to the charm. (A
gravel float? A tank full of jars of pebbles?) The characters are also
well done, though better developed in some cases than in others; the
humor value of the New Age bikers is considerable, but it might have
been nice to see what they do when you ask them about things like
inner peace, meditation, truth, etc. (Not to nitpick, but the line
"The bikers toss an unruly customer out of the pub and forgive
themselves for their trespasses" is a little silly. Since when do New
Agers care about sin?) The encounter with the bikers does, if the
randomized movements come out right, produce this exchange...

        As the words pass before your eyes, your spirit energies ebb
        and flow between hidden layers of conscious awareness, broken
        judgment, and unspoken truth. Once the trance lifts, your soul
        speaks of love and respect through haiku verse, the natural
        language of inner peace.

        The old man turns his pockets inside out to search for spare
        change.

...which one could take as a commentary on quite a lot of things if so
inclined. At any rate, though the characters never lose the feel of
being props or obstacles, they do provide considerable amusement.

Everybody Loves a Parade is not extremely difficult once the first
puzzle is solved -- but that first puzzle involves searching of
scenery that just barely gets a mention, and as such might take quite
a while to solve. Two other puzzles later in the game require a fairly
large intuitive leap, and a willingness to pursue courses of action
that don't seem initially helpful (and which are, well, largely
motivationless), and those moments pose considerable stumbling blocks
among mostly logical puzzles. (Though one solution in particular is
rather clever, and rewards careful reading.)  The quality of the
puzzles can be appreciated once they are solved, but the intuitive
leaps required can be a bit daunting at times. (I'm not sure what it
says about me, though, that the final puzzle -- at least, the way to
get the final 10 points -- seemed like a natural reaction to the
previous line, and it was the first thing I tried.) There is much
amusement to be had in the game even when stuck, though, just from
wandering around and trying things -- it seems safe to say that this
game has the most particularized responses to SMELL [object] in the
history of IF.

Mechanically, Everybody Loves a Parade works well; the TADS parser is
adequate for the job, and there are several synonyms for most
words. The writing is also quite good, though not exceptionally
descriptive--few of the scenes actually came alive from the writing,
though admittedly that would have been difficult given the bizarre
quality of the situations. The author trades absurdity for realism,
mostly, and does quite well with it--but creating absurd scenes is a
different task from creating real ones, and it is therefore hard to
compare the writing to a game that seeks to bring a place or event to
life. Cody Sandifer creates a carnival atmosphere, but a carnival
atmosphere is hard to sustain on repetition--a bouncy or silly room
description fades on the tenth reading in a way that a menacing or
dreary mood does not. All this is not, obviously, to say that
Everybody Loves a Parade is not written effectively, merely that the
intent is more to amuse and entertain than to create lasting
images. Well, actually, as noted above, that isn't true -- there is
one image that does last, and quite well -- but the circumstances for
that are unusual.

Mr. Sandifer clearly spent quite a while writing Everybody Loves a
Parade: it's full of humor that indicates real thoroughness. There are
several irrelevant objects -- "objects", perhaps -- that cannot quite
be considered red herrings because it would be difficult to consider
most of them potential solutions to problems, and which reduce the
feel of "am I done coding yet?" that sometimes plagues IF. (An author
who takes the trouble to code a "pulsing hunk of supernatural
hypermatter" is an author who cares about his finished product.) That
some scenes made me wish for more development is more a testament to
the amusing ideas at work than any laziness about coding; I certainly
can't say that there were many logical responses that went unprovided
for.

Perhaps of my initial objection to the twist alluded to above was that
it didn't fit the game, but when I thought about it more, I revised
that assessment. Only in a romp like this could the author pull the
player up short in the way Mr. Sandifer does -- and there are (at
least, it seemed so to me) very unfunny (as in, not a laughing matter)
issues at stake when it does happen, both within and outside the
game. There is certainly a place for games like "<a href="t.html#tapestry">Tapestry</a>," where the<br>player has to shut his or her eyes and ears to miss the Important<br>Underlying Message, but the IF world should not underrate the power of<br>this game's approach in making the player think.<br><br>There is, on the whole, much to like about Everybody Loves a Parade,<br>and though there are slow points and though the humor slows a bit when<br>the player has traipsed through the few locations several times, such<br>is the nature of humorous IF; Mr. Sandifer carries off his ideas<br>well. It is a testament to the author's skill that the player can look<br>back on Everybody Loves a Parade as both entertaining and thoroughly<br>thought-provoking.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/Parade.gam">

VERSION: Release 1

(Note: the following comments are based on the game as played with a
straight-text interpreter, but it does have HTML-TADS features.)

How important is it that interactive fiction be, well, interactive? Can
the medium--i.e., story advanced by reader/player's prompts--accommodate
stories that don't rely on anything the player does, that don't even
give the player an objective to drive the plot? These are some of the
questions posed by Ian Finley's Exhibition, a remarkably well-written
and thoughtful piece that gives the player so little to do that the
piece could have worked perfectly well as straight fiction. Moreover,
given most players' expectations, the playing experience in the
interactive medium is rather distancing--and yet the story itself is
genuinely intriguing, so much so that the player can almost forget that
he has no part in it.

It's a simple concept: you're in an art gallery viewing an exhibition by
an artist who recently killed himself, and you're viewing it through the
eyes of four different people--two of which knew the artist personally,
two of which didn't but assessed the exhibition as art critics. That's
the story: you look at the exhibition, switching back and forth between
the various characters as you please to view all the paintings, and you
also get various stray details about the crowd and the design of the
museum. In a sense, you discover that the real action of the story has
already happened, and you reconstruct it by examining the paintings, by
scrutinizing the various characters' reactions to the paintings, and by
choosing to credit this assertion about the artist and discredit that.
This is similar in a way to Infocom's mysteries, since the point of
those games was to reconstruct past events, though the problems there
were much more concrete--finding clues that lead to conclusions about a
murder, generally. The focus here, by contrast, is on the relationships
between the characters, between the artist and his church, between the
artist and his country-- well, obviously, plenty is going on here, and
much of it is really very interesting. Moreover, the author doesn't take
sides on the proper interpretation of the paintings--unlike conventional
mysteries, there is no right version to glean, though chances are that
the player will feel strongly by the end that a particular view is by
and large plausible.

There's an inherent difficulty here, though, in that it's relatively
easy to involve the player in tangible tasks like figuring out who
committed a murder; it's much harder to make him or her care deeply
about an artist's relationship with his church. The distinction is
simply the difference between having an objective and having a story to
read. To be sure, poorly done IF with a concrete objective can be highly
uninvolving, and the author here brings considerable skill in writing
and character development to bear on the noninteractive story--but,
honestly, making a player genuinely care about the characters and
relationships over the course of a fairly short work of IF is a
difficult feat. It's true that the player may respond intellectually
where he or she does not respond emotionally, i.e., warm to the task of
getting to the heart of the character simply because it's fun to sift
the material for the truth. It's a rather esoteric premise for a game,
though, and it's hard to see this as an IF genre with a lot of potential
adherents. This may be because the exercise doesn't really have much
bearing on anything outside the game--the speculation and debate
engendered by the game, if any, focuses on what this fictional artist
was like and what his various fictional paintings meant, not on anything
broader regarding art or psychology (or religion or sexuality, for that
matter)--which makes the intellectual exercise feel more like a logic
puzzle than a serious inquiry. 

Is that asking too much? Perhaps. But let's be realistic here: IF is
hardly an art form so divorced from an entertainment aspect that it can
avoid the requirement of a hook, something to draw the player in,
entirely. (Are there any such media? Maybe not, but the instinct, in
dealing with visual art or with music, is that those works need not have
a hook to succeed--whereas a medium like cinema, even when it aspires to
art, faces somewhat different expectations.) And what Exhibition really
lacks is a hook, or anything else giving the story a shape; broader
ramifications, perhaps in the form of an argument by the author about
something with life outside the game, might have done just that. As it
is, Exhibition is easy to appreciate as a well-written and well-crafted
piece, but it is difficult to imagine that people will be swept away by
its story. This may sound like pandering; I see it as realism, an
important aspect of storytelling. (For what it's worth, Babel, by the
same author, was absolutely terrific in this respect.)

None of this makes Exhibition a bad game, of course; I'd say it does
what it does remarkably well. The paintings are richly described, and
the character of the speaker comes across vividly in each description
(almost too vividly, in the case of one character who insists on
filtering everything through her own rather constricted experience, and
who becomes rather irritating--but, it seems clear, intentionally so).
The characters are designed so that certain people have more or less
insight into certain aspects of the artist, but none of them really
understand all of him--and the character perhaps in the best position to
understand him was in denial about a key part of his life. It all makes
for intriguing speculation, and it's possible to develop a measure of
sympathy for the artist along the way, though exactly how much will vary
with the player and with the way the player approaches the game (for
example, getting all the comments of one character at once, or viewing
each painting through four different lenses before moving on). Moreover,
the depth of characterization is highly unusual for IF, and it struck me
along the way that I would find it genuinely entrancing if I sensed that
understanding the character would somehow lead me to understand
something, accomplish something--even within the game. Exhibition, in
other words, may be significant more for what it could lead
to--development of a particular character in order to move a story--than
for the story it actually tells, where the trials and tribulations of
the artist are the plot. 

There is an obvious comparison here. Adam Cadre's <a href="p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> elicited<br>similar complaints of noninteractivity, from me and from others, after<br>the 1998 competition (though many others felt the interactivity quotient<br>was just right, of course). The difference between Photopia and<br>Exhibition, though, is that the former provided the illusion of<br>interactivity; the player's actions at least seemed to move the story<br>along, even if much of the story progressed without the player's help or<br>input. Here...well, there's no story to move along as such, so it's hard<br>to say there's an illusion of anything, really. More importantly, the<br>story Photopia told was well calculated to leave an emotional mark on<br>the player--too well calculated, some might say, but to deny its<br>effectiveness is to concede that the game did land its punch, so to<br>speak. It is a matter of opinion whether the emotional tug overcame the<br>limited interactivity there, but here the game is over before it<br>starts--the effect of the gallery as a whole is diffused over the course<br>of the explorations, and there is no particular moment that any player<br>is likely to remember. Moreover, part of the reason Photopia's illusion<br>of interactivity worked was that the game put the player in a variety of<br>settings and required him or her to perform a variety of<br>actions--whereas, here, EXAMINE, LISTEN and SMELL will yield just about<br>everything Exhibition has to offer. As those are arguably the most<br>passive verbs that conventional IF has to offer, other than WAIT, the<br>player has almost no power to affect the environment (and doing anything<br>out of line yields a message along the lines of "I don't do that sort of<br>thing," customized for each character). That passivity highlights, in<br>turn, how little the player can do in the story, and how similar the<br>experience is to reading a long series of descriptions of paintings.<br><br>This sounds more negative than it should be, because I did, in fact,<br>find Exhibition fascinating at many points along the way-- the author<br>plays the various interpretations off against each other very well,<br>particularly when a character makes a confident assertion about the<br>artist that, the player can feel reasonably sure, is entirely wrong. The<br>imagery is rich, and often disturbing; the critic's analyses show that<br>the author has a good sense of how to look at a painting. The stray<br>details, particularly when certain characters comment on people in the<br>crowd, are illuminating, and suggest that the characters viewing the<br>gallery are as much under examination as the artist. In the end, though,<br>I felt like Exhibition would work best as an extended, well-developed<br>aspect of a much larger game, rather than a game in itself, and I gave<br>it a 7 in this year's competition.<br><br><a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/exhibit_v2.gam">
