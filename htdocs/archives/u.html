  NAME: Uncle Zebulon's Will              PARSER: TADS's usual
  AUTHOR: Magnus Olsson                   PLOT: Linear

My third favourite of the competition games, after &quot;<a href = "o.html#one">The One that Got
Away</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href = "c.html#change">A Change in the Weather</a>&quot;.  I was reminded very strongly of
Infocom's game &quot;Hollywood Hijinx&quot;: there's a mysterious will, a hunt
through a deserted house, and plenty of descriptions which are enlivened
by references to my childhood memories of the place.  I almost expected
to find Uncle Zebulon still alive at the end, menaced by my evil cousin
Hector.  Perhaps the fabled city of &quot;Cyr-Dhool&quot; which I reach at the end
of the game is some kind of reference to Liz Cyr-Jones, co-author of
&quot;Hollywood Hijinx&quot;?

The background to the game suggested a world in which magic takes the
place of science and technology.  (The genre is known as &quot;elfpunk&quot; and
is exemplified by the novel &quot;The Iron Dragon's Daughter&quot; by Michael
Swanwick.)  This was very interesting, although it was perhaps too
subtly done, and didn't seem as relevant to the game as it could have
been.  I wondered if the &quot;train strikes&quot; mentioned in the opening text
(rather than, say, &quot;magic carpet strikes&quot;) were evidence that the
background wasn't part of the original design.  Certainly the Greek
mythology sits rather uneasily with either the elfpunk world in which
the game starts or the generic-fantasy land in which it ends.

I enjoy games where I have to sift through lots of information to find
material that's relevant to the puzzle I'm working on, and &quot;Uncle
Zebulon's Will&quot; was good in this respect: two letters, a torn note, a
scroll and a poem on a bronze plate.  There was a point where I wondered
if I was going to have to replicate Zebulon's alchemy experiments
(shades of &quot;Christminster&quot; here).  But it quickly became apparent that
most of the information was redundant, and from there on I found it
an easy game to finish.

The main impression I had of the game was that it was a very solid piece
of work.  There were no bugs, all the pieces of the plot fitted together
smoothly, the hook at the start was intriguing, and the ending was good,
though not as much of a surprise as it should perhaps have been.

There were various aspects that disappointed.  Apart from the one-object
restriction, which was excellent despite needing a completely gratuitous
demon to enforce it, the puzzles seemed a bit pedestrian.  There are
four objects hidden in obvious places and *two* puzzles involving
collecting a set of related objects.  The writing was very flat and
lifeless, managing to be lengthy without being either vivid or
humourous.  Half a dozen descriptions have some variation on &quot;This room
has been ransacked by your greedy relatives&quot;.  Magnus Olsson commented
in rec.arts.int-fiction:

    I tried not to be too literary; the more flowery the prose, the more
    time one has to spend polishing it.

I'm afraid that it shows; perhaps a bit more floweriness would have
helped.  And I was hoping for at least some people in the land of Vhyl
to welcome me.  Perhaps the sequel will reveal where they've all gone.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag8.html">SPAG #8</a> -- February 5, 1996

  NAME: Undertow                          PARSER: TADS's usual
  AUTHOR: Stephen Granade                 PLOT: Mystery
  EMAIL: sgranade SP@G phy.duke.edu            ATMOSPHERE: Good
  AVAILABILITY: $10 requestware, IF Archive      WRITING: So-so
  PUZZLES: Obscure                        SUPPORTS: TADS ports
  CHARACTERS: Don't convince              DIFFICULTY: Hard

This is a very ambitious work unfortunately let down by its
implementation.  Interactive fiction has to come to grips with
characterisation and complex character interaction, but it has to do
that while allowing suspension of disbelief and remaining interesting
and playable.  This kind of material was something I considered doing
for the competition, but rejected because I didn't have time, and
because in any case I don't know how to do it!  So I think Stephen was
very brave to tackle it.  It's just a shame that the result isn't very
good.

The characters in &quot;Undertow&quot; don't seem to have the knowledge that they
should have, based on what they've seen me do.  For example, suppose I
tell Carl that I have seen Thom's body in the water.  Later on, I still
get the exchange

    &quot;What is it?&quot; you ask him [Carl] en route.
    &quot;Thom. We've found him dead.&quot;

which was clearly written for the case when I hadn't seen Thom's body at
all.  The game lets me attack the other characters, but they don't seem
to treat me any differently afterwards than they did before.  Then there
are perfectly sensible actions that are prevented for arbitrary and
stupid reasons.  The worst such problem I found was that I couldn't pick
up Ashleigh's purse or get her gun!  Surely no-one in such a situation
-- a murdered man just discovered -- would leave a gun lying around on
the deck for anyone to pick up?  The game says that if I'm seen with a
gun, then people will think I killed Thom.  Well then, let me pick up
the gun, and implement the other characters' suspicions!

&quot;Undertow&quot; seems not to have been play-tested much (if at all), when in
fact the mystery genre demands extremely rigorous testing.  It's hard to
be a detective when you get responses like

    &gt; ask ashleigh about carl
    Carl is no longer here.

    &gt; carl, tell me about ashleigh
    You can't reach that from the dinette bench.

There are lots of little bugs, such as &quot;The battery cover is closed,
revealing a nine-volt battery,&quot; the consistent misspelling of &quot;gauge&quot; as
&quot;gague,&quot; and the way the &quot;shape&quot; in the water that looks like Thom's
body is still present after Thom's body has been pulled out of the sea.
There are also far too many objects: try typing &quot;tell all about thom&quot; in
the Forecastle -- I counted 25 scenery objects in that one room alone!
This clutter obscures rather than illuminates.

There are basic problems with the way the story develops.  After an
extremely hectic opening, suddenly nothing else seems to happen until
the boat explodes (a situation which reminds me of &quot;<A HREF="p.html#plunder">Plundered Hearts</A>&quot;),
and the player is left with no idea of what to do.

There does seem to have been a lot of work put into this, but the task
facing authors of this kind of game would seem to be greater still.
&quot;Undertow&quot; was too ambitious for the competition, but I'd be intrigued
to see what Stephen Granade could produce if he went back to the code
without any deadlines or time constraints and tried to finish writing
the game.  (If you need another play-tester, e-mail me).

<A NAME="undo"><h2>Undo</h2>
From: Magnus Olsson &lt;mol SP@G df.lth.se&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag7.html">SPAG #7</a> -- October 14, 1995

  Name: Undo                              Parser: TADS (hacked)
  Author: null dogmas (aka Neil DeMause)  Plot: What plot?
  Email: neild SP@G echonyc.com            Atmosphere: Weird
  Availability: F, IF Archive                    Writing: Adequate
  Puzzles: Very strange                   Supports: TADS ports
  Characters: Props                       Difficulty: Almost unplayable

One pleasant fact about the competition entries is that several of the
authors have not just aimed at writing &quot;classic,&quot; Infocom-style games,
but actually tried to renew the genre; to, despite the small format,
produce something new and original. 

The author of this game has obviously tried very hard to come up with
something original, and he or she has certainly succeeded, in the sense
that this game is totally unlike any other piece of IF I've ever seen.
In fact, I'm not even sure of what &quot;Undo&quot; really is - a game, an
experiment in TADS programming, a parody of IF, a meta-game? Perhaps
it's a little of each. Sometimes when playing it, I had the feeling
of being the victim of a strange practical joke. 

In any case, the meta-game aspects are pretty obvious. This is a game
about a game that has crashed just when you were about to win; only a
few steps to your east, a &quot;You have won&quot; sign beckons enticingly.
However, the way is blocked by a large hole that's just appeared in
the ground, and as you explore this little world (just five rooms),
you'll find that things have suddenly started to behave very strangely
indeed. 

True to his (or her, but for simplicitly I'll be politically incorrect
and use the masculine pronoun) pseudonym, the author has apparently
tried to turn all the conventions of IF upside down. Doing this
involves some wordplay, some self reference, and a lot of hacking of
the TADS library.

The results are of dubious quality. In turning everything upside down,
the author seems to have totally dispensed with internal logic and
consistency. The world consists of a number of locations and objects,
only very weakly connected and all behaving in very odd ways. There is
basically no way of deducing how things will work, which means that
the only way of solving the game - at least the only way I found - is
pure trial and error. Paradoxically, the fact that there are very few
actions to try makes this process of trial and error more, rather than
less, frustrating; trying to do a lot of things with no apparent
effect and no sensible messages can be very irritating indeed. 

I played this game some time and got steadily more and more
frustrated, getting nowhere, making some quite surprising discoveries
about innoculous-looking objects, all of which turned out to be
absolutely useless, and without getting a single point for my
troubles. In desperation, I posted a plea for help on Usenet, and was
kindly nudged in the correct direction; yet even with that help, some
further trial and error was needed before I stumbled on a sequence of
actions that actually won the game - but still without giving me any
points. 

It seems as if there's only one real puzzle in the game. In retrospect,
its solution has a certain weird logic to it, but you must probably
have as twisted a mind as the author to be able to solve it by
reasoning - sheer luck or trial and error seem far more likely
methods. The solution only involves one room and two objects; all the
rest has apprently been put in either just because they're neat ideas
or as red herrings. 
 
The score (or rather, absence of score) seems to be a pure red herring;
the game keeps telling you that you have zero points out of 86, but no
action (not even winning the game) seems to increase it. All this is
further aggravated by the fact that there seem to be a few genuine bugs
in the program (for example, try taking the zero while carrying things,
then putting it back in the swamp, or referring to it as "0" while
carrying it) - but, of course, in this game you can never be sure whether
the &quot;bugs&quot; are intentional or not. 

The author should certainly be credited for his creativity. Many of
the items in the game are very neat ideas, when seen in isolation;
perhaps they should be viewed as jokes. The recursive description of
the writing in the self-referential room is clearly a logical joke
(logic's equivalent of a word game?). There are also some quite
conventional (I'm shocked!) verbal jokes: the bogus error messages in
the dark room are very funny, while other jokes fall flat on the
ground. 

However, when all these elements are just thrown together and
presented as a game without any further explanation, the result is
more frustrating than amusing. If there had been some hidden internal
logic to be discovered it would have posed an intellectual challenge;
but personally I don't find trying to solve puzzles that aren't there
very challenging, especially when the only way forward seems to be
trial and error; it just makes me feel like the author is pulling my
leg. 

Had this been made into a &quot;real&quot; game (where there actually is a point
to it all) it could have been a great success.  As it is, perhaps the
most appropriate characterization would be to call it an anti-game. To
the prepared and not-too-weak-of-heart player I suppose it can be
quite a kick, but unleashing it on the unsuspecting contest judges without
a warning is cruel.

Review appeared in <a href="backissues/spag43.html">SPAG #43</a> -- January 7, 2006

TITLE: Unforgotten
AUTHOR: Quintin Pan
EMAIL: expiation SP@G devils.com
DATE: October 1, 2005
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-Machine interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware; IF Archive
URL: <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2005/zcode/

unforgotten/unforgotten.z5</a>
VERSION: Release 1

Clearly, I haven't sufficiently internalized the tropes of adventure gaming: I
was stymied for quite a while in the opening of Unforgotten, because after
being told that my friend really didn't want anyone to break into his
belongings and read his diary, my reaction was to respect his privacy.  More
the fool I.  For much of the game, Unforgotten seems primarily about sticking
one's nose into other people's business - the primary action is in unraveling
the secrets of the family of the player's friend.  Unfortunately, the contours
of the central mystery - not its solution, simply the setup - are very unclear
until relatively late in the game, and the author's penchant for twists make
the story more confusing than it needs to be. Underneath the continual Big
Reveals, there's an interesting story, but I felt like the thriller tropes
wound up getting in the way of the interesting relationships.

Unforgotten's beginning is probably its weakest section; after the rather
forced searching of the friend's possessions, the player is thrust into a
conversation which reveals some backstory, but leaves important concepts and
facts unexplained.  Then without warning, the setting abruptly shifts, without
the player being aware of what exactly has happened.  This middle section,
which contains the meat of the game, is clearer, and the player has specific
goals to work towards, but just when I felt like I had my bearings, an NPC -
the aforementioned friend's sister - began launching into exposition whose
relevance wasn't immediately clear.  Soon after, the player is thrust into two
vignettes, widely separated in time and space, which are likewise fairly
disorienting, and cast everything that's come before into doubt.  And then
there's a final big twist at the end (albeit this last one is rather heavily
choreographed).  I do enjoy games which are one big meta-puzzle - Jon Ingold's
corpus comes to mind - but here, the twists just sort of pile up on each other,
yanking the player one way then the other.  Eventually whiplash - and fatigue -
set in.

This is too bad, because the relationships between the three main characters -
the player character, his friend, and the friend's sister - are interesting,
and really drive most of the action. Foregrounding them a little more, keeping
the friend around for a while longer so the player can form an attachment to
him, and keeping the story more focused by more aggressively framing the
problem which the player is attempting to solve, would have made for a stronger,
sharper, more affecting game.  The wall-to-wall twists make the proceedings
feel contrived, and the game doesn't allow sufficient space for the
repercussions of each individual revelation to play out, which really reduces
their impact.

Unforgotten does do a good job of integrating puzzles into what's a fairly plot-
heavy game.  The initial journal-stealing sequence, for all my grumbling, is
actually well-put together; depending on how exactly the player goes about it,
there are a number of possible outcomes. There's a lot of fairly intuitive
sneaking around, and except for that first sequence, the player usually knows
precisely what he's working towards.  I found one puzzle in particular to be
shaky - lowering a doped pie to attack dogs on the end of a fishing rod feels
far too slapsticky for the rest of the game, and LOWER PIE seemed a much more
natural way of doing this than LOWER ROD - but otherwise the puzzles are well
clued, even when the player doesn't necessarily know what he's meant to be
doing.

One sequence does remind me of a comment I made about <a href="t.html#beans">Tough Beans</a>, to the
effect that too few games depict the player character reacting to events.
There's a scene in Unforgotten where the player is controlling a little girl
who, while hiding, overhears two soldiers talk about raping her mother - this
strikes me as a rather traumatic event, but for all the game discloses, the
girl reacts with stone-faced impassivity.  I'm not lobbying for histrionics
here, but any human being would be really upset in this situation, and the
tension of perhaps calling attention to yourself could make for a more
dramatically interesting scene.

Still, Unforgotten does pay more attention to questions of character than do
most games, and its narrative shortcomings are real but not fatal.  Definitely
worth a play.

<A NAME="unholy"><h2>Unholy Grail</h2>
From: Paul O'Brian &lt;obrian SP@G colorado.edu&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag13.html">SPAG #13</a> -- February 5, 1998

NAME: Unholy Grail
AUTHOR: Stuart Allen
E-MAIL: sallen SP@G one.net.au

PARSER: JACL standard
SUPPORTS: JACL interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition97/jacl/grail">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition97/jacl/grail</a>
VERSION: 1997 competition release

Playing Unholy Grail puts me in mind of the old saw about the glass
being half-full or half-empty. For each positive I can think of, a
counterbalancing negative also comes to mind. While the prose creates
sharp, clear, atmospheric images, it is also burdened with numerous
grammar and spelling errors. While the game had an inventive plot,
this same plot was punctuated with moments of tediousness,
implausibility, and pure frustration. And while Grail is orders of
magnitude better than Allen's 1996 entry <a href = "c.html#jacl">&quot;The Curse of Eldor,&quot;</a> it
still fails to realize both its own potential and that of its author.

Allen has accomplished a noteworthy programming achievement: he has
written his own IF engine, one which mimics much of the important
functionality of the current front-runners Inform and
TADS. Unfortunately, it still doesn't perform at the levels of either
of these popular &quot;standard&quot; IF engines, and suffers greatly by
comparison. Again, it's a yin and yang situation: a quality engine is
written from scratch, but it's still a poor competitor to the dominant
systems, marred by problems ranging from the complex (tortured
disambiguation) to the amazingly simple (an inexplicably arbitrary
pathname in the CONFIG file.)

Still, Unholy Grail was the first 1997 competition game I played, and
it wasn't an altogether inauspicious start. For one thing, it
represents remarkable progress on the part of the author. Unholy Grail
is not the fulfillment of Stuart Allen's promise, but it marks him as
one to watch.  With the improvements he's already made to his JACL
engine it seems entirely plausible that it could one day match the
quality of the current state of the art. Also, this game is one of the
few conceptually complete pieces of IF I've seen in the &quot;thriller&quot;
genre, a field which is in many ways well-suited to IF, but whose only
significant representative has been <a href = "b.html#bordzone">&quot;Border Zone,&quot;</a> a quality game but
one whose gimmick of real-time has often overshadowed discussion of
its generic groundbreaking. Unholy Grail was uneven; some things were
really very good, other things really not very good at all. I hope
it's a marker of better things to come.

Prose: I found the prose in Unholy Grail fairly difficult to read.
Sentences seemed to string endlessly, clause following clause until I
thought perhaps the author had asked Henry James to
ghost-write. However, I also think that the lack of a status line and
room name threw me out of my ingrained IF reading habits, the
disorientation of which probably contributed to my difficulty in
following the author's long narrative strands. Or it could just be my
own denseness -- that's always a possibility. Despite the game's
verbosity, though, strong images floated up to me out of the sea of
words. I have a very distinct picture in my mind of the swivel chair
and radar screen in the control room, of the battered hut whose
floorboards parted to show the ground below, and of the elegant,
elaborate hotel. The author clearly had done his homework, and was
able to create a very convincing picture of the character's
environment. I just had to read some of the sentences a few times
before I felt sure I knew what they were saying.

Plot: The most ringing endorsement of the plot I can give is this:
after the two-hour judging period had expired, and I was only 75%
through with the game, I spent another half-hour on it because I
*needed* to know how it ended. I found the plot difficult to get into
at first (see Puzzles), and needed to refer often to the science
encyclopedia so I could have a basic clue of what the game was talking
about, but once I understood, I was inexorably drawn in by the
skillfully dropped hints and slowly unfolding drama.

On the other hand (and there's always another hand when it comes to
Unholy Grail), I found some things in the plot pretty difficult to
believe. Small points like the layout of the complex were jarring:
would the military really have a female officer share a bathroom with
a male civilian?  Certainly the PC's name (&quot;Alex&quot;) is gendered
ambiguously, but imagining the character as a male (as I did) drains
the layout of some believability. Also, some larger points (such as
the Rotenone) seemed only to serve as red herrings, but created major
implausibilities in the plot: if I've determined that Rotenone is
causing the fish deaths, how can it be true that they're being caused
by something which in fact behaves entirely differently? For that
matter, if my basic science encyclopedia tells me that Rotenone causes
fish to drown, why do I blame it for cancer?

Puzzles: For the first hour I played the game, I was absolutely
stumped.  Finally, I resorted to the hint system and learned that
because an extra-long sentence in the room description of the lab, I
had neglected to examine the lab bench as closely as I ought. Once I
found the global positioner, I was off and running. Consequently, I
struggled with this game a lot more than its puzzles may have
merited. Most of the puzzles were fairly easy, when they didn't
involve guessing the verb (Can't turn the drum. Can't move the
drum. Can't push the drum. Can't pull the drum.  Can't look under the
drum. Oh, look *behind* the drum!), and some were quite satisfying
(especially the filing cabinet.) However, one puzzle was amazingly
tedious -- it basically involved typing &quot;n&quot; 20 times and &quot;w&quot; 20 times,
then doing the opposite. Here's where a &quot;swim to&quot; verb would have been
much appreciated!

Technical:
writing -- In addition to the stylistic factors I mentioned in
&quot;Prose&quot;, Unholy Grail was also plagued with grammar and spelling
errors.  Certainly there was some attention to proofreading, but one
or two more passes were needed.

coding -- Unfortunately this is where Grail stumbles the most. JACL
does a good job of imitating mainstream systems (especially Inform) in
many ways, but in other crucial areas it falls critically short. For
example, the system lacks an &quot;oops&quot; verb. Also, its disambiguation is
weak, a fact which caused a great deal of frustration for me as my
reasonable answers to its reasonable questions kept getting the
response &quot;The sentence you typed was incomplete.&quot; The system also
overuses Graham Nelson's famous &quot;You can't see any such thing,&quot;
applying it to sentences whose nouns are examinable and manipulable in
other contexts. In addition to these general systemic problems, Grail
itself had a number of particular bugs which I've reported to the
author in a separate email.

I was unable to play Stuart Allen's Unholy Grail during the
competition, because it wouldn't run on my computer and I didn't have
game-playing access to another one until after the deadline. Such are
the problems, I guess, with building a language and runtime from the
ground up. At any rate, though I wasn't able to cast an official vote,
I did find Unholy Grail, once I managed to play it, a reasonably solid
entry.

The JACL engine, for its part, was fairly good; I had read that it was
slow in its past incarnations, but I had no problems with it. The
major problem, to my mind, was that the game only allowed one save
position, meaning that I had to consider my moves extra-carefully
before saving the game. This is one feature which, I hope, will change
in the future. The gameplay was otherwise solid, as far as I can tell;
there were no crashes and no gameplay-complicating bugs. There was a
disambiguation problem with the liquids and the slides--I don't recall
the exact words right now--but TADS is just as vulnerable to those.

The game itself is intriguing. You play a scientist who has been
investigating disproportionate deaths of marine life, and your time is
nearly up with no solution at hand. Your mission is to find out the
truth before the military commanders at the nearby base send you
home--and if you don't think the presence of the military is
important, you clearly haven't been watching enough movies. It isn't
clear why you haven't gotten around beforehand to doing what you
do--your actions seem more common sense than a daring discovery--but
once you get off the ground, as it were, the plot moves along
nicely. It does take a while for that to happen, though, as the game
is crammed with red herrings and it isn't initially apparent just
where to start.

There are a few problems with the playing quality of Unholy Grail. At
one point, you must spend about 80 turns traveling to and from a
place, which seems rather excessive; there must be a way to allow the
player to travel there instantaneously while still requiring that the
player have the requisite knowledge for the puzzle. It is even
possible that the player will get to the right spot and realize he's
forgotten an item, though that does require some stupidity on the
player's part. The nature of the plot requires some suspensions of
disbelief, and the ending fits oddly with the rest of the story. On
the other hand, though, there are some nicely done touches, notably a
chemistry experiment of sorts that you undertake: it's done with few
needless complications and the actions are well coded. One stray
detail you run across in the course of figuring out the mystery is
particularly well done, and in general the game built the tension
well.

Though there are some glitches, they're blips on a generally sound
story.  Even though it invokes lots of science-thriller cliches--
isolated research team, a traitor trying to sabotage things, dramatic
showdowns, hubristic villains--Unholy Grail remains consistently
likeable. The puzzles are a large part of it; those in the endgame are
particularly good, I think, and the microscope problem was rewarding
to figure out.  Most of the puzzles weren't so hard that they slowed
the story down, which was certainly welcome. And I didn't notice any
problems with the writing--no grammar problems--and it built the story
up reasonably well.

The real problem with Unholy Grail in its current form is that it
lacks a hook--the player can spend a long time wandering around
picking up objects before he realizes what to do. Future releases
might eliminate some of the useless objects and work in an
interesting/mysterious/suspicious development early on that might lead
the player in, rather than forcing him to make the first--somewhat
obscure--discovery on his own. Further development on this game might
also develop the character of your lab partner a bit more--as it is,
we don't see much of her initially, and the nature of the player's
relationship with her is unclear. (No, no, not that kind of
relationship. Just how the partnership has worked, or not worked.)  On
the whole, then, Unholy Grail is reasonably diverting, and certainly
worth the download and playing time.

Unnkulian Zero is the latest in the Unnkulian series.  It is fairly
long and not as easy as the earlier games.  The puzzles are logical 
and funny.  You can get diverted from the proper path.  You must
search for 'The Lost Amanda', the King's daughter who was kidnapped.
You will encounter a monk as in the other games.  I was 'stuck' in
two places, but other players may not be.  I enjoyed playing it.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag12.html">SPAG #12</a> -- December 13, 1997

Adventions has decided to make their games freeware. Since this should
spur well-deserved interest in Unnkulia Zero (and since I just
finished said game a few hours ago) a review seems due.

The game once more brings us to the landscape known from Unnkulian
Underworld, but this time back in the days of yore when the Valley
King ruled. The king's betrothed Amanda has been kidnapped by the evil
unnkulians, and you, the king's most trusted warrior, is given the
task of finding her.

Unnkulia Zero adds immensely to the universe set up in Unnkuliuan
Underworld I and II, clarifying and expanding on old myths as well as
providing new ones. Compared to most other adventure games Unnkulia
Zero is very rich in text and has detailed descriptions of almost
everything mentioned in the game. The plot may be a bit linear at
points, but not more than should be expected when one wants a coherent
plot. The puzzles in the game are generally tough but in most cases
fair. A few of the puzzles cannot be said to be logical, though. At
least they require the special unnkulian logic that in many cases
turns things upside down. The player is adviced to read carefully,
since the text contains many clues and subtleties.

The weakest point of the game is that even the careful player can end
up in a no-win situation without knowing it. Some objects may simply
be overlooked until it is too late, others can too easily be lost
during the game. In at least one situation you have to give up some
objects at a time when you cannot be 100% sure of what will be needed
later in the game.

All in all Unnkulia Zero is a remarkable game that was fully worth the
money when it was commercial and which is a must now that it is free!

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag14.html">SPAG #14</a> -- May 17, 1998

From time to time a review in SPAG has been followed by another review
of the same game because the second reviewer disagreed with the first
reviewer or felt that some aspects needed more comments.  This time
not only the review is about the same game, also the reviewer is the
same person (although I am sending this from another email address).

The first review (in SPAG #12) was done a bit hastily in the middle of
the night after I had finally finished Unnkulia Zero. The deadline for
SPAG was passed, but I hoped to get it through to tell the IF world
about the game, specifically that it had been released as
freeware. The review did get through, but it was less thorough than
the game deserved. So, I'll use the possibilites of IF and do a ...

&gt;RESTART

Background: The unnkulian universe was created along with the first UU
game, &quot;<a href = "#unnkul1">Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure</a>&quot; (UU1), by D.
A. Leary. This was a game with tongue firmly planted in cheek, at the
same time writing in the good-old-style of games like &quot;<a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a>&quot;
and making fun of most of the traditional conventions. Leary's
excellent writing abilities ensured that the game was not just a
simple parody but instead a very funny game taking place in a universe
of its own.

UU1 was followed by David M. Baggett's &quot;<a href = "#unnkul2">Unnkulian Underworld II: The
Secret of Acme</a>&quot; (UU2), Leary's &quot;<a href = "#unnkulhalf">Unnkulia Onehalf: The Salesman
Triumphant</a>&quot; (Onehalf), and then Leary's &quot;Unnkulia Zero: The Search for
Amanda&quot; (Zero). Finally Baggett wrote &quot;<a href = "l.html#legend">The Legend Lives</a>&quot;
(Legend). Originally UU1 and UU2 was released as shareware titles,
Onehalf as freeware, Zero as a commercial game, and Legend as
freeware. But few people bothered register the shareware games and
even fewer people would spend money on actually _buying_ a game. Now
Baggett & Leary (together known as Adventions) have done us all a
favour we don't really deserve: They have given all their games out
for free. The URL above points to a file containing the .gam files for
_all_ games released by Adventions. This includes the above-mentioned
games as well as Leary's &quot;<a href = "h.html#rylvania">Horror of Rylvania</a>&quot; and Baggett's remake of
the original Adventure: &quot;Colossal Caves Revisited&quot;. The games are full
versions, patched only to remove any mention of payment. What more
could we ask for? Beware that the file is rather large, about 1.1 MB.

This review is based on the commercial version 1.2 of Zero, which
seems to be the same as the free version 1.0G contained in the file.

The story: The Valley King is furious and desperate. The Unnkulians
have kidnapped his beloved Amanda! He sends you, his most trusted
warrior, out to find her. This won't be an easy task ...  During your
search you will have to face a giant snake, the Valley Patrol, a
salesman from Acme, and your fear of heights. To complete your task
you will also have to travel in time, shut down a nuclear reactor, and
possibly learn more about the ways of Duhda. Last but not least you
must match wits with Wowsa Willy, the great magician of the old days!

The game is rich in many ways. The writing is very good and
imaginative. Spelling errors and typos are nonexistent. Each location
has a description of typically 5-10 lines of text that gives a vivid
impression of the place (in my mind I still have detailed pictures of
very large parts of the Unnkulian world). Much attention has been paid
to details. You can examine almost everything mentioned in the text,
and the descriptions are not just run-of-the-mill &quot;this looks like an
ordinary &lt;object&gt; to me&quot;.

Unnkulia Zero adds immensely to the world established in UU1 and UU2.
UU1 and UU2 took place in different locations but with Zero these
locations are linked together. The opening of Zero takes place in the
same locations as UU1 (and Onehalf), and later the player may see a
bit of the landscape from UU2. I am impressed at Leary's ability to
use the same locations as starting point for several games and then
let the stories evolve in different ways that makes it natural that
some locations of one game cannot be accessed from another. Had I only
played one of these games I probably wouldn't even notice that I was
being restricted from some areas - every game has its boundaries and
most of the boundaries in these games feel natural.

But the landscape is far from the only thing that links the games
together. Right from the beginning (i.e., UU1) hints of a greater
scheme showed up from time to time, and Zero adds immensely to this
game world. Taking place in the days of lore, when the Valley King
ruled, it lets us know about the time that was the past in UU1 and
UU2. Old myths are expanded on, ambiguities are resolved, and new
myths are presented. Even the Amanda mentioned in the game's title is
no newcomer: Her name was found on an old table in UU1 and in the bark
of an oak tree in UU2.

With a game world given such consideration it should come as no
surprise that Leary has chosen to let the player's character be a
fixed one. In the game's own words:

    You're a hulking Valley Warrior, one of the fittest of the Valley
    King's soldiers.

This may annoy people who want to think themself directly into the
story but it allows for more details in the description of the player
character. For instance, the player character of Zero suffers from
vertigo, a weakness the person playing the game may not share. In
fact, Leary makes a vitue of necessity and lets the text comment on
the player character from time to time:

    You're standing outside the Valley King's forest retreat.  It's a
    simple hut where His Regalness sheds the trappings of modern
    civilization and gets back to nature.  You don't entirely
    understand his thinking; you're a warrior, not a philosopher.  But
    he is, after all, the king.  Paths wind through the woods to the
    north, west, and northeast.  The hut is to the south.  Through the
    trees to the west, you can see sunlight glinting off the waters of
    Lake Draounheer.

The game has several NPCs. Some are simply obstacles (e.g., the
snake), others take active part in the fate of our hero (e.g., the
nymph). None of the NPCs are pure cardboard, but they generally have
their own things to do and aren't up to long talks or developed
interaction. In a way the most interesting NPC is someone who strictly
speaking is not a character in the game: Wowsa Willy. You never gets
to meet or see Wowsa Willy, but you will visit Willy's tower, find a
book written by Willy, and possibly hear from Willy himself. An
example:

    You're deep in the heart of the swamp now, in a dismal clearing of
    quicksand and mire.  A gentle old willow tree hangs over the
    clearing, vine-covered branches dipping low.  The only safe path
    is back to the east.
    Without warning, your feet sink into the muck.  You try to move,
    but can't. You're sinking in the quicksand - and you don't have
    much time left!

    &gt;examine wand
    The wand is a thin piece of wood, quite light and flexible.  You 
    can barely make out tiny letters down the side that read 'Wowsa 
    Willy's Wishing Wand - Works When Waved.'

    &gt;wave wand
    &quot;Cretin!&quot; a voice booms.  &quot;Bother me not with such petty wishes!  
    Escape from the sand yourself!&quot;

How our hero escapes the bog is another story...

This brings us to the puzzles. From a puzzle-solving point the game is
hard, in its own words &quot;dam tuff (7 out of 10)&quot;. [*] I am not very
good at solving adventure game puzzles myself and got stuck several
times. The puzzles are generally logical and interesting.  They are
integrated in the plot and not just added as an afterthought. Players
that explore their surroundings are in many cases rewarded by small
hints to the puzzles, especially if they can read between the
lines. The puzzles range from find-the-key (although to find the key
you will have to solve another, more interesting, puzzle) to
complicated and original puzzles. In between are some variations over
old puzzles, like how to deal with the monk (also met in UU1 and UU2)
or how to cross the Stoll Bridge. Most of the variations include new
twists, and none are direct lift-offs.

[*] The spelling reflects the way Acme describes its products in the
UU games. People who played UU1 and UU2 and grew tired of the &quot;cheez&quot;
jokes can relax: Zero is almost cheez-free.

In a few cases &quot;logical&quot; is not the right word for the puzzles. I
cannot decide if this is to be considered bad or not. The world of the
UU games has always had its own rules, and although not logical the
puzzles are consistent with the game setting. The most &quot;nonlogical&quot;
puzzle is related to the burial mound, and since I solved that puzzle
without any help we see that nonlogical doesn't have to mean
impossible or unfair.

Unfair puzzles or not, the game is not without problems: Even the
careful player may end up in a no-win situation without knowing it.
Very few puzzles can be screwed up without giving the player proper
notice, but some objects can be overlooked or lost. The most likely
object to be overlooked is the jade figurine, which is to be found
rather early in the game (and I ain't gonna tell you more!). Other
objects are too easily lost. At one place in the game the player will
have to give up some objects. There are lots of objects to spare in
the game, but as an apparently useless object can turn out to be very
handy it is impossible to be 100% sure _which_ objects can be spared.
This is quite serious, especially since some objects can be lost a
long time before the player realizes they were essential.

The plot of the game is well developed, and the story unfolds without
forcing itself on the player. Some puzzles have to be solved in a
particular order, but that is only natural if we are to expect a
coherent plot. In most parts of the story several independent puzzles
can be considered at a time. Although non-linear on the way the
adventure has one ending. One might think that the games title gives
the ending away right from the start, but one is in for a surprise.
The ending is satisfying but not in the way that is expected.

To sum up, I consider Unnkulia Zero an ought-to-be classic. The game
does have its faults but they are few and heavily outweighed by the
positive things to be said. Getting hints may be a problem, because so
few people have played it (yet!) and Adventions are not going to give
hints any more. My advice to players in need of a hint: Try
rec.games.int-fiction. There are quite a few people out there, and
maybe one of them can help you. If that fails, mail me. I am not very
good at giving subtle hints, but I do know the game well. In any case,
don't rush for hints right away. The game is rich enough to reward
those who take the time on it.

The bottom line can be copied from my original review: All in all
Unnkulia Zero is a remarkable game that was fully worth the money when
it was commercial and which is a must now that is is free!

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag30.html">SPAG #30</a> -- September 20, 2002 -- as part of a Review Package

As I played through more games in the Unnkulian series, I got the
growing impression both of the major game authors, Mr. Leary and Mr.
Baggett, influenced each other, so that their approaches to game
design became closer (if you read the previous review, you'd know
what I mean).

Unnkulia 0, for instance, is much less "linear" than <a href = "#unnkul1">Unnkulia 1</a>, the
previous game by Mr. Leary -- although the central goal of the game
still is defined at the very start, the sub-goals don't stand out as
clearly.

The plot was much deeper than in Unnkulia 1, though its main idea
seemed somewhat moot to me. The atmosphere, however, remained as
light-hearted as in Mr. Leary's previous work, including the
recurring theme -- this time, those are references to the "powerful
wizard" Wowsa Willy.

Puzzlewise, the game left me with ambiguous feelings: on one hand,
the author clearly made a serious effort to make it more challenging
for the player; on the other hand, this effort partly resulted in a
much larger possibility to make it unwinnable without warning than in
any of the previous games of the series. Plus, a couple of puzzles
seemed to be loaned directly from <a href = "#unnkul2">Unnkulia 2</a>. Since I doubt Mr. Leary
hadn't got enough fantasy and skill to create good puzzles (as he had
proven the opposite too often), I considered this to be an in-joke I
didn't understand. But it wasn't of a benefit to the game, anyway.
And a note for maze-haters: Unnkulia 0 contains two pseudo-maze
puzzles - mostly for the purposes of mocking the universal
maze-abhorrence, it seems.

All in all, I'd say this work organically fits into the Unnkulian
universe, providing lots of background for it, but doesn't introduce
(m)any groundbreaking ideas. Because of this, it probably would be
wise to try out one of the previous games first; chances are high
that, if you don't like them, you won't enjoy Unnkulia 0, either (and
vice versa).

SUMMARY:

PLOT: Very solid
ATMOSPHERE: (Sometimes inappropriately) light-hearted
WRITING: Not very different from Unnkulia 1
GAMEPLAY: Nothing unusual
BONUSES: Provides lots of background, funny references to other Unnkulian
         games, as well as <a href = "a.html#advent">ADVENTURE</a>
CHARACTERS: See the comment for WRITING
PUZZLES: Fine for the most part - the quibbles are listed in the review
DIFFICULTY: The game's statement to be 7 out of 10 seems to be true

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag30.html">SPAG #30</a> -- September 20, 2002 -- as part of a Review Package

This game, in which you play, for a change, on the "bad" side -- an
Acme salesman -- has been created as sort of an "appetizer" for
<a href = "#unnkul0">Unnkulia 0</a>; thus, it isn't either hard or deep. It was like in a
circus -- the spotlights went on, the main comedian entered the lit
circle in the arena, and the performance began -- now, who wouldn't
enjoy a clown's show?

Well, *I* didn't.

As the story progressed, and the PC got his prescribed portion of
kicks and socks, I noticed that, instead of laughing, I started to
feel pity for the poor guy. Sure, an Acme salesman isn't the most
pleasant person to deal with, and an intellectual giant he isn't,
either -- but not giving him even a single chance just seemed unfair
to me. To put it simply -- few things in IF are more terrible than a
game author who doesn't like his own PC at all, no matter how bad
this PC is. (Again, that's entirely my personal point of view --
regarding both what's worst in IF, and whether the author of this
game really doesn't like his PC).

Fortunately for Unnkulia 1/2, Mr. Leary's sense of humour (which,
admittedly, remains up to the mark) finds other outlets than derision
of the PC, so that the game had its enjoyable moments, after all.
(For example, try referring to the fabled Bicorn of Radeekal with
"goat").

And that's pretty much all I can say about the game -- in all other
respects, it's not outstanding; if you like Unnkulia in general, and
aren't as over-sensible as myself ;), you're probably going to enjoy
it. One final warning, though: like in other Unnkulian games, you
sometimes can get yourself killed without warning; however, *unlike*
in other Unnkulian games, you can't undo your last action after doing
that (I don't know the reason why this feature has been removed from
Unnkulia 1/2, but I remember it being an unpleasant surprise when I
played it); thus, "save early, save often".

SUMMARY:

PLOT: Boils down to a treasure hunt
ATMOSPHERE: Clownery
WRITING: Unnkulian standard
GAMEPLAY: Doesn't differ much from <a href = "a.html#advent">ADVENTURE</a>
BONUSES: Clever embedding into the Unnkulian universe
CHARACTERS: Unnkulian standard
PUZZLES: Not very challenging, but some are nice
DIFFICULTY: Modestly describes itself as being trivial (2 out of 10)

the second part there are some puzzles in which I didn't find any logic at
all.  The writing is quite well done and gives the reader a good
description of what is going on.  The plot gives the player a lot of freedom
and lots of things can be done in parallel.  The characters that appear are
simple and don't allow much interaction with them, I wish they were a bit
more active.  Lastly, there is lots of humour in this game.  It may get a bit
repetitive, but humour is an important part of the game.

Well, considering the aforesaid, we're dealing with a practically
flawless game here;). Seriously, Unnkulia 1 has everything a text
adventure needs to be successful: a nice setting, a memorable player
character, good puzzles... Admitted, it's not as deep as most of its
successors -- but for what it lacks in depth, it makes up in bright
humour, and vividness of descriptions, with "all the recurring themes of
the Unnkulian games established here, from Duhdhism and the obligatory
fried egg puzzle to the Acme Corporation and its vastly inferior
products" (sorry for the quotation from Carl Muckenhoupt's review in
Baf's Guide, but you simply couldn't put it better -- except that funny
reincarnations of the Bridge Troll from ADVENTURE, the obligatory
presence of a bar/lounge, and a couple more things probably should be
added to the list of recurring themes).

One trick David Leary used to make his player character appear more
realistic was especially amusing for me: you see, the game begins with
the death of the man whose slave the PC has been. It must be said the
hero doesn't like his late master, Kuulest, too much. On the other hand,
Kuulest was the centre of his world for quite a long time. And thus,
during the course of the game, the former slave keeps recalling his
master on every appropriate, and sometimes less appropriate, occasion,
referring to Kuulest with words derivative of "geeze" (as in, "The old
geezebreath sure won't need it anymore, so it's yours now.") These
reminiscences form yet another recurring theme -- this time, not for the
whole series but for the game -- which helps the overall atmosphere a
lot. Likewise, the NPCs are worthy of praise: they're probably not the
most advanced ones, in that they don't carry out complex scripts, nor
are they burdened by an AI; no, they've been implemented under the usage
of but the basic animation techniques - which hasn't kept them from
being vivid, and characterized nicely (the way one of them suddenly
becomes interested in his fingernails when being asked for help still
makes me smile when I think of it).

The only thing one could complain about in Unnkulia 1 is, it's somewhat
straightforward. Somewhere in the beginning of the game, you get your
task -- to save the world by doing this and that -- then, you go and do
it, and that's about it. The whole layout of the game, plot- and
puzzle-wise, seems to insist on the principle formulated by Michael
Roberts in his TADS Manual: "Filling in the details of the plot can
proceed by 'working backwards' from the overall goal <of the game> to
the major sub-goals, then backwards to the smaller goals that must be
reached for each sub-goal, and so on." OK, that's not a bad thing in
itself -- I'm aware it's to a very large extent a matter of personal
taste whether you prefer more or less "goal-oriented" plots/puzzles/
games; thus, I'm just expressing my own opinion here.

And one final observation: you know, the whole time I've been playing
Unnkulia 1 I had a funny feeling the game reminded me of something. This
feeling remained latent until recently, as I was reading a book that was
part of the Myth series by Robert Lynn Asprin, and came across a
reference to ACME corporation. At this moment, everything suddenly slid
into place: I realized that, coincidentally or not, the mood in Unnkulia
1 was very reminiscent of the Asprin's humorous works' style (not that
it's a rip-off, mind you). Again, it's entirely a matter of personal
preferences whether to see it as a 'good' or a 'bad' thing; for me,
however, it was as wonderful as meeting an old pal somewhere you didn't
expect to see him.

SUMMARY:

PLOT: Rather straightforward "save the world"
ATMOSPHERE: Wonderfully Asprinish
WRITING: Vivid and humorous
GAMEPLAY: Goal-oriented, a bit linear
BONUSES: Rich setting with many Easter eggs, references to "old geezer
Kuulest"
CHARACTERS: Non-exceptional, but nice
PUZZLES: Not that hard, but fun to solve
DIFFICULTY: Claims to be (and probably is) handleable (5 out of 10)

This is the continuation of your life as a hero.  I would rate it higher,
but the plot is a bit jerky and there is one 'fatal' error.  There is a
computer and you must know the password before the game tells you.  That
means you must have someone or a walk-through tell you.  In general, it
is still amusing, but not as good as UU1 and not as involved.  I won't
say what the object is because that is part of the plot.

When I started playing Unnkulia 2, my first impression was, I was dipped
into the world of <a href = "#unnkul1">Unnkulia 1</a> again -- which surely wasn't much of a
surprise. However, this was the case of the first impression that's
deceptive: the longer I played it, the more I got the feeling Unnkulia 1
and 2 were quite different. I admit I had to mull over a lot before I
could get at the roots of this difference, but I think I found the
answer.

The thing is, David Leary's goal seemed to be the creation of a *game*
that'd be fun to play; by contrast, David Baggett seemed to be trying to
create a *world* that'd be fun to explore. Thus, in Unnkulia 1, you're
given a goal to work towards practically at the very start; in
Unnkulia 2, you are set out into your yard without any particular goal.
Well, closer to the end you'll receive some sort of hint what to do, but
you still won't know what's *really* going on until you make the final
move. Hence, your stimulus not to give up and to keep playing here is
the exploration of the game world. This might appear like a rather
meagre motivation, but the author put enough effort into the setting to
make such "exploring for the sake of exploring" an entertaining pastime.
The game impresses by plentiful, maybe even excessive scenery, lots of
interesting things to do, and loads of... OK, looks like we're in for
another diversion. ;)

It's been said Unnkulia 2 contains loads of red herrings; to me,
however, that doesn't seem true. You see, a red herring is something the
author puts into his game for the sole purpose of misleading the player.
For instance, let's think of a game taking place in an underground
station. Say, a locked trophy case containing a magic wand, that stands
amidst the platform, and for which no key exists in the game, clearly is
a red herring. However, a fully functional control gate is not -- it's
rather a well-implemented scenery object, and remains such one even if
there is no need for the player to ever pass through it. Similarly, all
the "red herrings" (maybe with very few exceptions) in Unnkulia 2 turn
out to be scenery objects, which give the setting even more depth.

And one more difference between the two Unnkulias, which probably also
results from the dissimilar approaches used by their authors: Unnkulia 1
can be mapped out much easier than Unnkulia 2. The latter resembles <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a>
a bit, in that it sometimes provides a sudden shortcut between locations
that seemed to be on the opposite ends of the map. Such a layout makes
the place appear more "tight" -- the single locations hang together much
better.

The humorous aspect of the game isn't as obvious as in Unnkulia 1, where
the jokes virtually are hurled at the player; here, they are hidden in
object descriptions and responses. Unnkulia 2 presents a more restrained
style than its predecessor - which doesn't mean it's any less funny. One
of my favorite moments: somewhere in the game, you arrive...

   On Top of Dawg Rock, West of the River

   Here you are, on top of Dawg Rock. This would sure impress the
   climbers, you think to yourself. Too bad no one's around to notice.
   But no matter. The striking beauty of Dawg Rock and the landscape
   below make standing up here alone a great joy.

   &lt;SKIPPED&gt;

   The rocks become trickier here, and consequently the only ways to go
   are east, back to the bridge, and down, which I would highly advise
   against.

   > 

(Naturally, the first thing I tried was...)

   > DOWN

   I told you, I advise against it.  Must I always nag?

The puzzles in Unnkulia 2 were very hard for me -- to a large degree
because the game wouldn't offer a direction to go; even the built-in
"hint machine" didn't always help. Also, there were three rather
large mazes. Since, as mentioned above, I've got nothing against
mazes as such, and because I'm so fond of Unnkulian games, I'd say
Mr. Baggett was on the verge of overdoing it in Unnkulia 2; someone
less (or more ;) biased probably would say he passed this verge by
far. Still, the puzzles were well-designed and satisfying to solve.

But with all these nice features, the game would fall apart because
of its rather loose construction -- if it wasn't for the plot. At
first, you probably wouldn't see much of it, for the reasons
described above. You'd keep playing because of that feeling there's
something interesting waiting for you around the corner. Gosh, I've
played enough games (and read enough books, for that matter) that
used exactly this device -- and many of them turned out to be a
let-down. But not Unnkulia 2 -- the final twist of the plot nicely
tied up all the loose ends that cropped up during the game, and
secured the whole structure, like a keystone of an arch. Great it
was, just great.

SUMMARY:

PLOT: Probably appears to give more freedom to the player than it does
      in reality
ATMOSPHERE: Certainly present
WRITING: More restrained than in Unnkulia 1, but not less humorous
GAMEPLAY: Almost totally undirected
BONUSES: Generous setting with LOTS of Easter eggs
CHARACTERS: Not as vivid as in Unnkulia 1
PUZZLES: Well-designed, but a bit illogical sometimes
DIFFICULTY: Claims to be 7 out of 10 (to me, it seemed more like
            10 out of 10)

<A NAME="unravel"><h2>Unraveling God</h2>
From: Edward Lacey &lt;edwardalacey SP@G hotmail.com&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag31.html">SPAG #31</a> -- January 3, 2003

TITLE: Unraveling God
AUTHOR: Todd Watson
EMAIL: jillandtodd SP@G earthlink.net
DATE: September 2002
PARSER: ADRIFT
SUPPORTS: ADRIFT runtime
AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2002/adrift/unravel/unravel.taf">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2002/adrift/unravel/unravel.taf</a>
VERSION: 1.0

Like a number of the other competition entries, Unraveling God is
heavily story-based; in fact it contains essentially no puzzles at all.
This is more than compensated for by an original plot and a generally
high quality of writing that depicts the game's characters very
effectively. The author also deserves credit for attempting to discuss
the science behind the plot; while this isn't done totally convincingly,
it places the scientific aspects of the game well above the "this works
this way because I say so" style of explanation that characterises some
science-fiction.

The narrative jumps back and forth through time in a manner apparently
inspired by <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a>, although the player controls a single character
throughout and most of the game takes place in a single set of
locations. The first of these differences was, for me, welcome, and I
found it easy to empathise with the character, but the second difference
is the cause of a couple of problems. While I didn't notice any
inconsistencies in the text for the different time periods, the shifts
aren't quite handled perfectly; for example, it's possible to get a
phone call in one time period that should have been received in another.
I would also note that the ADRIFT parser used by the game is not the
best.

However, these relatively minor criticisms would not on their own have
prevented me giving the game more than the four points I awarded it. My
real problem was with the game's endings. It was obvious that there was
a right choice and there was a wrong choice. First, I tried the right
choice, and got more or less the ending I'd expected. But the ending
that followed the wrong choice was really quite shocking -- not because,
as I'd expected, my decision would cause great harm, but because its
final sentences as I read them seemed to suggest that my decision had
essentially been irrelevant. This seemed both to undermine the key idea
of the plot and made me feel angry that I was expected to regard what
now seemed a needless sacrifice as the "right choice". Arousing strong
feelings in the player would generally not be a bad thing, but in this
case it felt that the game was trying to promote a particular
moral/theological argument, and this left a bitter taste in my mouth
that was reflected in my score.

The author afterwards explained to me that my interpretation of the
ending wasn't what he'd intended at all, and perhaps the lesson can be
drawn from this that the reader of any text shouldn't attach too much
weight to its final sentences. Looking back, I may note that I would not
have reacted as I did if the game had not been so successful at making
me sympathise with my character. Indeed, that the game appeared to me to
support a worldview that, it turned out, was actually very different
from that of the author is testament to his creativity. I look forward
to playing any of the author's future offerings.

My Rating: 4
