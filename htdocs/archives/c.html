VERSION: Release 0 (competition version)

Okay, there are a lot of problems with this game, but I'm going to try
to be constructive about it. This is a game where the author is having
an enormously good time and the player is having no fun at all. That's a
heck of a problem, and it's a sad one to have to point out to someone
who's got a big cheesy grin on his face. This author went wrong
somewhere along the line, and had no clue he was creating a total
misfire, even has he continued to pack in numerous contrivances and
clever details and elaborate red herrings and locations and multiple
puzzles with multiple solutions. I'm sure he thought it would be a lot
of fun. In a way, it reminded me of my first Comp entry, "<a href = "f.html#four">Four in One</a>,"
which was packed with all sorts of fun details that only a few players
ever saw because the main game wasn't fun enough to warrant exploration.

The setting of the game is kind of a limp workplace satire that looks
like it fell through a wormhole from the 1999 Comp. Meet your boss, Mr.
Norom. Ho ho ho. That kind of thing. First location of the game: a
cubicle with a computer. Next sixteen locations of the game: everyone
else's cubicles. Sigh.

I halfheartedly played along for ten minutes, and felt totally lost as
to what to do. The author provided no focus at all. Sure, there was a
stated goal: get a big cup of coffee. But that fails to provide any
focus when you're rambling around trying to interact with
thinly-implemented NPCs and office settings. I found a hidden hole
puncher and a coffee maker and some day-old coffee grounds, and I did
somebody else's work because a notepad suggested I try that, and then I
gave up. I went to the walkthrough file, and, just like I did with last
year's limp workplace satire, "BOFH," I ended up just reading the whole
thing and quitting then and there, because (just like last year) I could
see there was no point to trying to come up with the contorted solutions
to each stage of the game on my own. The walkthrough made it clear that
I'd have to be the author in order to solve the author's puzzles.

For example, I mentioned that I found a hole puncher, which I assumed
had something to do with punching the holes on the freebie coffee card I
also found. But, that wouldn't work until I also did the following:

   Escape the office and go to the Buy 'n Blow. Enter and exit the 
   shop until you see a message that the store is being robbed. Go 
   tell the cop about it and go back to the store. You will see 
   the theif being arrested and drop something. It is his knife.
   Get the knife and cut the card three times. Presto! Instant 
   legitimate coffee card.

Can you see the problem with the above? In order for me to be pursuing
this goal, my efforts have to be somewhat directed. I could spend two
hours wandering around the game map, running through laundromats and
bookstores and finding all sorts of items and fighting off rats and
never hit upon the idea of waiting for a store to be robbed so that I
can tell a cop to arrest the guy so that he drops the item I need to
finish the work I started with the hole puncher. The mind boggles. And
yet, I can emit a long, slow whistle at the hours the author must have
put in to implement all of these nifty ideas of his.

You can't let your players flail around trying to read your mind. You
have to use the game's text to give them direction and focus. This game
was all over the place, even in the smaller section of being trapped in
the office. I have a feeling this author is going to be somewhat
surprised and very disappointed at how his game places in the final
rankings.

Because I didn't give this game much of an honest chance and quit to
read the walkthrough, I have to decide whether to recuse myself and not
vote on it, or just give it a score based on its failure to engage me. I
guess I will choose the latter.
 
RATING: 4

<A NAME="cara"><h2>La Cara Oculta de la Luna</h2>
From: Javier Carrascosa ("Grendel Khan"), translated from the Spanish SPAC

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag49.html">SPAG #49</a> -- August 18, 2007

April 14th, 1935, in any city in Spain. There is great political upheaval and 
social instability. The Spanish people don't know it, but there's only one year 
left before war will ravage their country. And you have your own problems: 
you're a university student who, with your ever declining income, can hardly 
finish your studies. The factory where you were recently working has just closed 
down, so you have lost your job. Eating a late breakfast for the first time in 
many years, you have a 
look at a magazine. Almost by accident, your eyes notice a small advertisement:

"Prestigious psychologist professor of the University of Salamanca needs subject 
to study. Experiment consists of a series of questions. Every participant will 
be paid a thousand pesetas. Details: The Hidden Side of the Moon, Old Way, 
Km.6."

A thousand pesetas! That's a lot of money! You don't think twice before going to 
the address mentioned in the advertisement. It's an old mansion built many years 
ago by some rich guy, and thought to be abandoned by everyone around. It now 
belongs to the psychologist, apparently, and you don't care too much where he 
does his experiments as long as he pays afterward...

(...)

Thus begins one of the most difficult adventures of the last few years in the 
Spanish community. In "La Cara Oculta de la Luna" we play the part of a poor 
Spanish guy who, spurred by his debts, decides to become the guinea pig of a 
psychologist. But what we imagined to be a boring session of questions and 
answers turns suddenly into a hard trial to the death. The protagonist is locked 
in an old mansion with only a madman for company. A madman who has promised to 
hunt him down and kill him in a few minutes- unless he finds a way to escape.

There are "feelies" included with the game: some annotated images of paintings 
by "El Greco," and an article on the film "Leave Her to Heaven" by John M. 
Stahl. This information seems to have nothing to do with the game, because as 
soon as we play a little we find out that the most important goal is to discover 
an exit from the house. So the "El Greco" paintings will soon be forgotten... 
until we find them in the game. And that's when we also find one of the best 
puzzles I've solved 
since I started playing adventures, in the painting "El Caballero de la Mano en 
el Pecho" ("The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest").

The old mansion is a trap for us. We are unable to escape through any window, as 
all of them are barred. We can try to exit through the chimney, but with no 
success, and trying to exit through the attic results in death. Exploring the 
house can be easier with the help of a map. My advice is to draw one with a 
pencil and paper and take down all the rooms and their connections. Although the 
hunter will kill us even before we've managed to get to the second floor, 
there's a little trick to avoid that: don't follow the hunter in the first scene 
and take your time investigating the house before talking to him.

The game would make no sense without the figure of the hunter, one of the best 
characters I have ever seen in an adventure. He possesses all the qualities of 
the classical psychopath: a well-mannered and educated gentleman who hides a 
relentless serial killer inside. All kinds of theories can be outlined about the 
hunter... Who is he? Why is he motivated to act this way? The fact is that he 
will inevitably manage to kill us when we are first starting to play. Getting 
rid of him is a very 
complicated task, although there are five different ways to do it. This gives us 
the opportunity of replaying the game to find all the possible methods of 
defeating the hunter.

The difficulty of the adventure is high, although not as high as some other 
Spanish adventures like "La Torre" ("The Tower") or "La Isla de Tokland" ("The 
Island of Tokland"). But solving some of the puzzles will amply reward the time 
you spent on them. Take some time to examine the objects and to find the exits 
through the floors and ceilings of the mansion. Look for all the "El Greco" 
paintings. There's a lot to discover. Also, there's a prize: if you manage to 
finish the adventure, you can access a secret file the author has hidden on his 
website. That file has the name of a certain object you can see at the end of 
the adventure. Hurry up before he loses his hosting!

Conclusion: La Cara Oculta de la Luna is an excellent adventure that grips you 
from the beginning with its well cared for setting and superb programming. The 
hunter is a believable character with whom we can always interact, something to 
be grateful for in Spanish adventures. The game can be discouraging at the 
beginning, but as soon as we start moving and uncovering the many details this 
adventure holds, we find that we can't stop playing. It is inexplicable that 
this adventure is one of the most forgotten in the Spanish community.

My theory on the hunter (Warning: don't read this if you haven't finished the 
game):

The aristocratic figure of the hunter makes me guess that, although the mansion 
is not his home, it could have been the house of a relative or friend who he had 
to kill once his secret was discovered. The hunter must have hunted elephants 
and lions in Africa, and in that continent he must have known other cultures. 
His passion for hunting probably increased while assimilating the beliefs of 
some savage African tribe which worshipped a bloodthirsty god to whom they 
offered their sacrifices. Our man adopted those beliefs and traveled back to 
Spain to hunt a different kind of animal in its habitat: humans! It wasn't hard 
for him to find his prey. Famine and misery battered most of Spain and he only 
needed the lure of an economic profit to attract his victims. The habitat where 
they would move would be the mansion, appropriately prepared by the hunter: bars 
on the windows, locked wardrobes, beds without mattresses, tables without 
drawers... the prey would have no other option but hiding. No other option? No, 
the hunter always gives a means of escape, and that's where another of his 
passions comes into play: painting. Our man is a painter; maybe not a very 
critically acclaimed one, but a good imitator, and an admirer of the work of "El 
Greco." His house contains many different copies of "El Greco's" paintings, made 
by himself. His prey need only find one of his most renowned works: "El 
Caballero de la Mano en el Pecho" ("The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest"). 
If they are curious, they will be able to discover the key that will lead them 
to freedom.

The hunter is a follower of the Fascist movement, judging by the books in his 
library, and an initiate in the Dark Arts, judging by the other book we can take 
from it. That's where my theory comes from that he makes sacrifices of his 
victims in the same way as the tribes he found in Africa.

Even so, the hunter made some mistakes: he didn't consider the possibility of 
his prey killing him in his own field, did he? The fact is, if we climb to the 
second floor and look at the lounge from above, we can see whenever he's coming 
after us. If at that point we are armed with a small table or a stool, we can 
throw it at his head and get rid of him. We can also finish the game without 
killing him, though, which is a very advisable option to avoid the remorse of 
becoming killers ourselves.

VERSION: Release 1

Well, that was a rousing adventure.

I refer, of course, to the adventure of getting "Carma" to work on my
Linux system. But an hour, 4 source packages, and 2 patches later, I was
all set for the full multimedia experience. Hooray! Many thanks to
Marnie for giving detailed system-specific advice in terps.txt, so I
didn't have to break down and boot into Windows.

It was well worth the effort: the graphics, sound effects and music in
Carma are absolutely delightful. In particular, the Perry Mason shtick
with the jarring chords had me roaring. And if I could stop my
evaluation at that, I'd give this entry a 10.

Unfortunately, I found little enjoyment in Carma outside of the
whizzbang multimedia, and I guess I'm still old-fashioned enough to feel
that that's missing the point of Interactive Fiction. The biggest
problem was simply the *lack* of interactivity: I felt like I was
spending over half my time in cut scenes (note to authors: please make
cut scenes skippable!), and the interactive parts were not well-fleshed
out. The "strike" scene was particularly tedious--interview X, ask X
about X, ask X about sign, ask X about demands, repeat N times.

By the time I got to the courtroom scene, the whole thing was growing
tiresome, although I perked up a bit at the highly-amusing Perry Mason
spoof. This brings up Carma's other major weakness: punctuation, however
you slice it (splice it?), just isn't exciting enough a subject to carry
one through a mid-sized IF game, not even for other would-be writers. It
would have done better as a shorter piece.

The programming was competent, and if nothing else, this makes for a
great glk/glulx demo. And on a final positive note, I loved the ending.

<A NAME="cast"><h2>Castaway</h2>
From: Graeme Cree &lt;72630.304 SP@G compuserve.com&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag5.html">SPAG #5</a> -- April 19, 1995

  NAME:  Castaway                       GAMEPLAY:  No synonyms
  AUTHOR:  Conrad Button                PLOT:  Rudimentary
  EMAIL:  ?                             ATMOSPHERE:  None

  PUZZLES:  Basic                       SUPPORTS:  MS-DOS
  CHARACTERS:  None                     DIFFICULTY:  Novice

     In Castaway, by Conrad Button, you are first mate of the cargo
ship, Katie Sue (I don't know why, but I suspect that this is Button's
daughter.  A little nepotism here, hmm?).  When your ship is smashed on
a reef, you fortunately wash ashore on an island that has a rescue ship
anchored a mile away.  Your job is to find the fixins' for a signal
fire, as well as locate ten treasures hidden on the island.
     The mixing of the rescue theme with the treasure hunt theme
produces some bizarre results.  Though you will probably spot the ship
a few moves after landing, you will avoid signalling it until you've
gotten all the treasures.  In real life you'd be much more concerned
that the ship might leave.  You can get around this problem by
signalling the ship but not boarding it until you've gotten all the
treasures, but this creates another bizarre situation:  the ship
sitting in the lagoon waiting around until you feel like being rescued
(&quot;Snap it up fella, we haven't got all day!&quot;).
     In your search, you will encounter the lost city of Pango Tongo,
which has several of the treasures you need.  We are never told
anything about this city like &quot;what is it doing there,&quot; and &quot;what
happened to the people&quot;.  It is just there.
     The game features the traditionally bad Buttonware parser; two-word
input and absolutely no synonyms.  If you call the &quot;parrot&quot; a &quot;bird,&quot;
the game will have no idea what you're talking about.  The game's
difficulty level is Novice, so you probably won't have much trouble
solving it anyway, but generally introductory games should be as
user-friendly as possible, to encourage the player to play more text
games.  This one doesn't.
     One nice feature (that I wish more Introductory games would
emulate) is that each room lists the directions that you can travel on
a separate line. This is much easier for the novice trying to draw his
first map than having to pick all of the directions out of the room
description.
     Castaway is not up to scratch by 1995 standards, but one must
remember that it was written in the pre GAGS/LADS/AGT/TADS/Inform days
of 1986.  Under the circumstances, putting out any shareware text game
at all was an impressive feat.

VERSION: 3

A 10k adventure? How good could it be? With visions of Scott Adams' 16k
(master)pieces in mind, I began with trepidition. I found the game,
converted it to pdb format, and loaded it on my aging Handspring Visor
PDA. 

The intro is concise and informative, and gets you into the action right
away. The game possesses a pulp fiction or a Golden age comic book feel.
Your quest? Retrieve the necklace of your uncle Xevion from his
mysterious house. It's straight-ahead youthful mystery-fantasy. 

The room descriptions are sparse, occasionally omitting words,
presumably to save memory. Some of the error messages are unhelpful
because of their brevity. For example, a simple one word response with
nary a period in sight shows up quite a bit. Still others are errors,
where a blank line displays as the response to your actions. You'll also
notice some familiar synonyms missing, the most annoying of which is
"get" -- you must use "take".

Frustration builds into a claustrophobic spiral, brought on by the small
number of rooms, the crippled parser, and the unhelpful responses. Only
occasionally do zephyrs of humor lighten the mood. Want to take a
breather? You can't, because the game can't be saved. Granted, that's
not a problem on the PDA, unless you wanted to play another IF game and
resume where you left off. Still, I'm of the opinion that all
frustrating games should allow you to save. 

Catseye consists of one puzzle that starts off simple and rapidly
becomes maddening; you have to play "guess the verb" and also "guess the
input format for the verb". I finally resorted to r.g.i-f to find enough
clues to win the game. I say that to my embarrassment, but to the
author's shame. Even when you've won, you feel like the game's getting
the last laugh. Your effort is rewarded with a scant two sentences.
Unfair! 

I congratulate Bernazzani for cramming a game into 10k. However it feels
like more of a programming triumph than an artistic one. The game is
playable, but inordinately frustrating. It has an interesting feel, but
not enough to compensate for the parsing problems and lack of feedback
(both of which seriously interfere with gameplay). The lack of verbs and
missing punctuation are also drawbacks. In short, thumbs down.

Score: 3/10.

PACK UP THE CATS
Cattus Atrox by David Cornelson

Theodore Dreiser has been called the worst prose stylist ever to
qualify as a great writer.  Over the course of my college career I had
to read his SISTER CARRIE no fewer than four different times, and sure
enough, Dreiser's prose is often just laughably bad.  Whether he's
interrupting a paragraph to mention that &quot;It was in August, 1889&quot;
(without specifying what &quot;it&quot; was), or beginning a chapter by
introducing &quot;the, to Carrie, very important theatrical performance&quot;,
or lurching into ridiculous archaisms like &quot;Carrie!  Oh Carrie! Ever
whole in that thou art hopeful!&quot;, Dreiser's control over the English
language often reminds the reader of a four-year-old trying to steer a
Saturn V rocket.

Still, there's a reason I had to read SISTER CARRIE four times, and
it's not because my professors were trying to get me to break out the
aerospace refs.  The prose, rough as it is, is often startlingly
effective: the railway strike chapter, for instance, is rendered with
a you-are-there intensity unmatched by many a more polished writer.
Which is why Dreiser was very much on my mind as I played Cattus
Atrox.  Cornelson's prose isn't going to impress anybody: it's full of
comma splices and other errors, not to mention such howlers as
&quot;lust-filled orgasms&quot; and a character screaming &quot;LIONS!&quot; into a
telephone and then hanging up.  Nevertheless, Cattus Atrox provides
the most intense visceral experience of any game in this comp.

Now, I'm not one to lose myself in a game the way some people
apparently are: at no point did I myself feel fear when the lions were
smacking the PC around.  But you couldn't tell from the way I was
playing.  During the chase scene, I was entering directions as fast as
I could, running around in a panic, typing N then W then N then E then
S then W then S again without even bothering to glance at the text
flashing by.  Not really the recommended method of playing IF, but,
y'know, I had to get away from those lions.  I mean, they were, like,
eating me and stuff.

And then when I found the crowbar, I mean, forget it.  Here I'm the
guy whose game specifically penalizes the player for being so cruel as
to do violence to an animal, and the second I find the crowbar, I
switch into full-on Neanderthal mode.  I beat that lion cub to death
with the club and then stood there beating its corpse over and over
again even as on a conscious level I recognized that the game was
spitting error messages at me for doing so.  I took that crowbar and
spent the next half hour whacking anything I registered as a noun.  It
got to the point that I half expected that if I threw the crowbar into
the air it'd turn into a spacecraft.

So while the prose is less than masterful, the syntax for some
required commands is often weird, and the ending is silly and over the
top, Cattus Atrox gets high marks for grabbing me by the collar and
yanking me out of detached-observer mode.  This game stuck with me.
Several games later I had to restrain myself from rushing into the
<a href = "m.html#muse">Muse</a> telegraph office and tapping out &quot;LIONS!&quot; on the telegraph.

My score: 7.3 (5th place)

VERSION: Competition release

This comic, old-school science fiction game gave me a bad feeling at the
very beginning, with introductory text that ran on for a couple of
screen pages before the first prompt. Normally, that turns me off right
away. However, when I took the time to read it all, it was fairly
amusing. Funny enough to make me feel like there would be some chuckles
to be had along the way.

I actually had to take more than two hours to finish this game, even
though it is not particularly large. It was one puzzle after another,
and eventually, despite the in-game hint system, I got stuck. The hint
system was welcome, but broke down after a certain point. I kind of got
faked out by it, in that I learned to rely on it -- at one point, at the
most complicated puzzle, the final hint in the sequence for that area
goes ahead and spells out exactly all of the things you need to do -- so
that when it thinned out and stopped being specific, I was left flailing
around. There's nothing quite as frustrating as being trapped in a very
small map with a pretty limited set of objects, and having no idea how
to make the game proceed. You end up pacing around, staring at the same
sixteen locations and the same inventory of red herrings over and over
and over again. In the end, a combination of this and the game's other
problem (which I'm about to get to) made me deduct a point from the
score I was going to give it just for being a generally entertaining
old-school game.

Here's an instance of something that, as a player, bothered me:

   Window Washers' Scaffold
   Across a small gap to the east is the open hatchway of the 
   Cerulean ship. Falling into the gap would most likely be fatal, 
   but you're certain that you can jump into the spaceship with 
   little difficulty.

   >jump
   You jump up and down. It's like being on a pogo stick, except 
   without the pogo stick.

   >jump to hatchway
   I don't know the word "hatchway".

   >jump to hatch
   I don't know the word "hatch".

   >jump to ship
   I don't know the word "ship".

   >jump into spaceship
   I don't recognize that sentence. 

   >x spaceship
   I don't see any spaceship here. 

   >jump to shuttle
   I don't recognize that sentence.

   >jump gap
   I don't know the word "gap".

   >e
   Cerulean Landing Vehicle
   The interior of the Cerulean landing vehicle is made of the 
   same shimmering metal as the outside of it. [...]

If an author tells me, "you're certain that you can jump into the
spaceship with little difficulty," I expect >JUMP INTO THE SPACESHIP to
be implemented. I mean, come on.

The nastiest bit of business like this begins when you finally make it
to the alien ship. Everything on the ship has a label of some sort. You
get some glasses that allow you to read the language. I guess maybe it
was because the author wanted to allow for you not having the glasses,
and so separated out the reading of things to be handled separately, or
maybe it's just a case of TADS allowing READ to be a separate verb from
EXAMINE, unlike Inform. (Inform can be made to do this, of course, but
TADS comes with a 'readable' class in the standard library.) But it
drove me batty, examining things only to be told "It has some writing on
it.", forcing me to READ it:

   >x wax
   The can of floor wax has some writing on it.

   >read it
   Some English writing on the can of floor wax reads, "Floor
   Wax. Warning: Highly Flammable! Keep away from fire". Highly 
   flammable floor wax? Is that safe? You suspect that they the 
   Ceruleans got a really good price for this at some liquidation 
   center.

Why not just tell me what it says when I'm examining it? Gradually,
grudgingly, I trained myself to use the READ command instead of typing
X, but old habits die hard. I play a lot of IF. I'm used to EXAMINE, you
know, printing descriptions of things.

Here's a choice encounter with this problem: 

   Security Center
   A bank of monitors fills most of the north wall, and a 
   huge control console fills the west wall.

   >x console
   The control console has three basic panels on it: an output 
   panel, an input panel, and an action panel. Each of these panels 
   has further controls on it.

   >x output
   Which output do you mean, the output panel, or the output control 
   dial?

   >panel
   The output panel has an output control dial and some writing on it.

   >read output panel
   Some Cerulean writing on the output panel reads, "Output panel. 
   Select output location using the dial below".

   >read input panel
   Some Cerulean writing on the input panel reads, "Input selection 
   panel. Select input source using the dial below".

   >x input dial
   The input control dial has some writing on it.

   >read input dial
   Some Cerulean writing on the input control dial reads, [...]

   >x action panel
   The action control panel has some writing on it. 
   Three buttons are set into it: one red, one green, and one blue.

   >read action buttons
   I don't see any action buttons here.

   >x red
   Which red do you mean, the battered red lunchbox, or the red 
   button?

   >button
   This button has some writing on it.

   >read red button
   Some Cerulean writing on the red button reads, "Stop".

It took me too long to figure out that the bulk of the game was all
about finding ways to dispatch alien guards one at a time, until I'd
offed enough of them to get to the endgame. It wasn't until after I'd
hit the two-hour mark that I realized this was the point of it all. Just
when I was about to quit, I hit on this idea, so I finally saw what was
apparently a winning ending about twenty minutes later, although I only
had 126 out of 161 points. The most I ever got was 145 points. I have no
idea how you get the last sixteen lousy points, but I don't care to try.

Hmm. Writing about this and reliving my gripes has made me deduct
another point. This game might have gotten a score of 7 from me in the
best possible case: amusing, with some interesting puzzles, but still
built from a clich&#233;d set of ideas at the core. That'd be worth a 7 on my
scale. However, I got frustrated and stuck a lot, and the READ thing was
pretty annoying, and I wasn't able to finish in two hours. Sorry, but
that's how it goes, I guess.

chancel.gam</a>
     
Kevin Venzke is the author of Kurusu City, the entry in the previous IF-Comp
that (at least as far as I'm concerned;) would have won the TADS division if
the division rating still was there. Well, the reviewed work is *entirely*
different; the light-hearted atmosphere of Kurusu City made way for gloominess
and mysteriousness, and probably the only thing that remained unchanged was the
player character being a young female.

Chancellor rather brought up reminiscences of two other IF-classics: for one
thing, Dave Lebling's <a href="l.html#lurk">Lurking Horror</a>, from which it inherited parts of the
setting (a deserted college building), along with a couple of characters (
including a murderous janitor); for the other, <a href="l.html#losing">Losing Your Grip</a> by Stephen
Granade that lent to it the way of telling the story in several fits, the
switching of the player character between two fairly distinct worlds, as well
as the extensive usage of deeply symbolic (well, maybe pseudo-symbolic) stuff.

Actually, a superposition of elements from other works alone isn't a suitable
tool for creating a decent game, no matter how splendid the "donors" have been.
OK, OK, I probably don't have the right to say such things, because 
Chancellor's inheritance of certain features from other games is entirely my
assumption, and the similarities mentioned earlier might be purely coincidental.
Anyway, coincidence or not -- Chancellor does better than just mixing up
ingredients of other games, and introduces a device personally I quite rarely 
(if at all) encountered in IF: it lets the two game worlds melt together. This
process goes on not too quickly, but steadily, progressing with each episode:
first, items from one world start appearing in the other one; then,
interconnections between the worlds begin to crop up, and finally, the two
worlds become one. It's been a thrilling experience indeed, which has been
enhanced even more by the magnificent writing and the very comprehensive
setting that implemented every object mentioned in the descriptions, and
responded adequately to every action I could think of.

Unfortunately, the game isn't crowned with a worthy end; rather, it shakes off
all the mysterious stuff the player has encountered using a quite battered
excuse. In this respect, it called to mind yet another work of IF -- this time,
<a href="r.html#rippled">Rippled Flesh</a> by Rybread Celsius, where the player, after being taken through a
series of weird rooms and shown a number of scary things, receives an ending
that is essentially unrelated to the game itself, along with an explanation of
all the oddities he encountered (in the vein, "the bloody corpse in the bedroom
was a practical joke of your second cousin once removed... and the hellish
sounds coming from the hall was your dog Berny toppling over the clothes tree".)
Now, Chancellor acts very similarly -- only the explanatory note isn't needed,
and thus (thankfully) absent. That's a pity; while cutting the Gordian knot is
a handy approach for a number of real life situations, it doesn't work half as
well for entangled IF-plots. On the other hand, I can understand the author's
point -- resolving the story properly probably would double the game size, thus
rendering it totally unsuitable for the Comp.

Still, in spite of this not minor issue, Chancellor remains a notable game, even
-- I dare to say it -- a "must play". You just don't see worlds being melted
together every day.

SNATS (Score Not Affecting The Scoreboard):

PLOT: The ending spoils it somewhat (1.0)
ATMOSPHERE: Galore (1.5)
WRITING: Discreet but effective (1.5)
GAMEPLAY: Unhurried (1.4)
BONUSES: Two worlds blending together (it seems I can't stop saying that
         again and again;) (1.5)
TOTAL: 6.9
CHARACTERS: Quite good, but not the kind I'll remember for the rest of
            my life (1.2)
PUZZLES: Just solid (1.2)
DIFFICULTY: Manageable (6 out of 10)

COMP SCORE: 6

COMMENTS: Chancellor was one of the few entries in this Comp not providing
          any hints or a walkthrough (the stub of a hint file that was
          accompanying it contained clues for the prologue only). Combined
          with the unhurried gameplay (and it must be said that the rich
          setting practically pleads for not moving ahead too fast and for
          fiddling with the environment instead), this resulted in me getting
          stuck somewhere within the third fit by the end of the judging
          period. At that stage, there was no sign yet of the two worlds
          growing together -- the feature that, in my opinion, makes
          Chancellor outstanding. Thus, I had no other choice than to give
          it a rating corresponding to solid yet non-exceptional games. A
          simple inclusion of a walkthrough would earn it at least one extra
          point from me.

<A NAME="change"><h2>A Change In the Weather</h2>
From: Magnus Olsson &lt;mol SP@G df.lth.se&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag7.html">SPAG #7</a> -- October 14, 1995

  Name: A Change in the Weather           Parser: Inform
  Author: Andrew Plotkin                  Plot: Non-linear
  Email: erkyrath SP@G netcom.com            Atmosphere: Excellent
  Availability: F, IF Archive             Writing: Excellent
  Puzzles: Time-critical                  Supports: Infocom ports
  Characters: One, simple but memorable   Difficulty: Above average

During a picnic with your friends, you decide that you'd like some
privacy and walk away on your own to explore the nearby hills. Soon,
however, the warm, beautiful summer evening turns into the proverbial
dark and stormy night (the &quot;change in the weather&quot; of the title), and
you find yourself cut off from your friends by a rain-swollen stream
that threatens to carry away the only bridge...

Although unpleasant, such a mundane situation may not seem like the
stuff from which a tale of wonder and adventure is built. That,
however, is just what Andrew Plotkin has succeeded in creating. With
very small means he manages to increase tension until your attempts to
save the bridge turn into a nightmarish struggle against time. The
writing is excellent, as are the atmosphere and the changes in mood.
As if to demonstrate further how far you can get with deceptively
simple means, the one NPC of this game - an endearing little fox -
doesn't do very much, but is nevertheless very effective (of course,
animal NPC's are simpler than humans since they don't speak). 

Despite its small size, &quot;A Change in the Weather&quot; is not an easy game.
The author himself classifies this game as &quot;cruel,&quot; and that is no
great exaggeration.  The puzzles aren't very diffciult in isolation,
but they are very time-critical and you have to perform actions in a
carefully timed order to win. You should be prepared to save and
restore a lot, even to replay from the beginning, since the tiniest
mistake will put the game in an unsolvable state. 

This kind of game behaviour has been condemned in the debate on
rec.arts.int-fiction, the main argument being that all the restoring
and replaying ruins the enjoyment of the game and disrupts the
story. Also, of course, it lowers realism if, for example, you have to
die five times beofre finding the right way to disarm a bomb; in real
life you have to get it right the first time.

In this particular case, however, having to save and restore
frequently didn't detract anything from my enjoyment of the game;
in fact, somehow knowing that the smallest mistake may mean disaster
actually enhanced the sense of drama and urgency. It may of course
have helped that you can't die in this game (the worst thing that can
happen is that you have to wade across the stream to get home). The
size of the game certainly played an important part - having to
restart from the beginning is less cumbersome in a tiny game like this
than in a larger game.

To summarize, this is an excellent little game: well written, with a
simple goal that isn't that easy to attain, an interesting sequence of
logical puzzles and an excellent atmosphere; all of which makes this
perhaps the most memorable of all the competition entries.

  NAME: A Change in the Weather       PARSER: Inform v1405
  AUTHOR: Andrew Plotkin              SUPPORTS: Infocom Ports
  EMAIL: erkyrath SP@G netcom.com          AVAILABILITY: IF Archive
  ATMOSPHERE: Outstanding
  WRITING: Generally well written, though eye slides past in spots
  CHARACTERS: Memorable
  PLOT: Mutual exclusion between branches
  PUZZLES: Nicely done, but with dead ends and save/restore puzzles
  DIFFICULTY: Moderately challenging

Now *this* is more like it.  The game starts out rather slowly:
you wander away from a picnic to go exploring in the park.  After
a beautifully described sunset (and an encounter with the
competition's most memorable NPC), the idyllic day suddenly turns
nasty, and you are forced to seek shelter, eventually thrusting
you into a dreamlike race against time and vague, sinister evil.

The atmosphere, scenery, and overall sense of immersion in this
entry were far and away the best in either division, approaching
that of Infocom's better efforts in spots.  In one or two spots,
the writing is dense enough that the casual reader's eye slides
right past (lists of exits, mostly), but otherwise the writing
is among the best in this year's field.

If there's a weakness here, it's the rather languid pace that the
game gets off to at first.  That's an unavoidable consequence of
the tranquil, contemplative mood that the author creates in the
first section, but it makes it difficult to warm up to the game
at first.  The plot really needs a kick in the tail that it doesn't
get until after nightfall; an opening with enough action to make
wandering off alone seem a welcome respite (playing volleyball until
you get sick of it, perhaps?) might correct this.  (The virtues of
establishing emotional context through player interaction rather
than imposing it by fiat have been discussed at length elsewhere.)
Of course, the game flirts perilously with the two hour limit as
it is; leaving out such an opening is understandable given the
nature of the competition.  Furthermore, the contrast between the
slow pace of the first section and the frantic pace of the dream
sequence works quite well, and is perhaps the sole example of
such a mood shift in the contest.

The save/restore nature of the section after nightfall is also
likely to put off many players, as is the game's ability to be
closed off after the player attempts actions that are otherwise
perfectly reasonable.  While any race against time necessarily
runs the risk of degenerating into save/restore, a bit more time
between the appearance of the light source and the expiration of
the player's time might have been nice; as it was, I didn't get
past that part before time ran out.  Likewise, a second (possibly
more difficult) option for getting into the cave after the
destruction of the needed object would also have helped.  Still,
the game was quite satisfying, especially in contrast to the
rest of the division.

BOTTOM LINE: Yes.  Like that.  My choice for the division winner.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag8.html">SPAG #8</a> -- February 5, 1996

My second favourite of the competition games, after &quot;<a href = "o.html#one">The One that Got
Away</a>&quot;.  This was a fun experiment and a deserved winner of the Inform
category.  I found it very challenging, but it wasn't outright
impossible (unlike one or two of the other games in the competition), so
I think the difficulty was well-judged.  Three aspects of &quot;A Change in
the Weather&quot; were excellent: the quality of the writing, the changing
descriptions of the scenery, and the way the components of the puzzle
interacted.  I was reminded of my decision in &quot;Christminster&quot; to keep
the player indoors from seven p.m. until ten so that I didn't have to
write descriptions of the sun going down!  Andrew Plotkin tackled this
problem head on and the result was very impressive.

What I didn't like was the very short time limit and the way it was
incredibly easy to get stuck.  To finish &quot;A Change in the Weather&quot;
required an enormous amount of patience: going back to a saved game,
trying something new, observing the consequences, going back again and
trying something else, and on and on.  The puzzles themselves were quite
elegant, but I didn't appreciate them very much because I was a bit
fatigued by the process of solving them.  I also felt the game lacked
for NPCs (the fox was better than nothing), and the dream was just
willfully obscure.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag14.html">SPAG #14</a> -- May 17, 1998

PLOT: Small, tightly woven (1.6)       ATMOSPHERE: Remarkable (1.8)
WRITING: Excellent (1.6)              GAMEPLAY: &quot;Cruel&quot; (1.3)
PUZZLES: Very difficult (1.3)         CHARACTERS: One, intriguing (1.2)
MISC: Interlocking parts fit together well (1.6)
OVERALL: 7.9

Andrew Plotkin's first serious game, as he terms it, is an intriguing
effort: it introduced the IF community to many key Zarfian elements,
notably the &quot;cruelty&quot; of making nearly every move vital and closing
off the game without warning, and the magic realism that dominated
<a href = "s.html#sofar">So Far</a>, though it's present here in a much subtler form. Beyond that,
though, Change in the Weather offers a remarkably vivid setting, and
effectively uses small changes in the landscape to advance the plot.

The story, at first glance, is not overly complicated: you wander away
from your companions in a park and get stuck out in the rain on a
steep hillside, and must use what comes to hand to keep a bridge from
washing out. Watching all the while is a fox who seems to understand
the action better than you do; the fox is only relevant on two
occasions, but having it around gives you a sense of collaboration in
your efforts to save the bridge. At any rate, the story is essentially
divided into two; there is a languid opening section that affords a
chance to explore the hill, and a breathless second half where you
have, by my count, precisely one move to waste (out of perhaps 45 in
all). The landscape changes to reflect the onset of the darkness and
the rain, but various events--lightning striking a tree, for
example--also cause important changes. Virtually every detail is
vital; the player is advised to take time in the beginning to observe
everything available.

Change in the Weather is a veritable textbook for authors who want to
know how to create and then change a mood, or infuse a scene with
tension. The changes in the landscape, while important to the plot,
are perhaps even more important for the atmosphere they create. In the
first part, for example, we get this:

   You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface.
   Greenery hides the stream below and the hilltop above, and the
   meadows and sky beyond sweep away into the incandescent west.

Whereas, after nightfall:

   You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown
   hillface. Rain hides the stream below and the hilltop above, and to
   the west is only dark.

The changes in the setting to induce a change in mood recall
<a href = "w.html#wishbringer">Wishbringer</a>, and while Change in the Weather owes less to fantasy than
Wishbringer, the details evoke a similar sense of unease, reinforced
by voices in the distance which seem to be calling your name, and
which become louder as you dash around the hillside. Plotkin is
particularly skillful in using timed events and small details to
heighten the tension: once the protagonist awakens amid the storm,
everything appears to be happening at once--runoff starts flowing,
lightning strikes a tree and a branch falls, the stream rises, and the
voices in the distance persist at the edge of the player's
consciousness. The various events are all separated by line breaks, so
they have the feeling of independent events that are following their
own paths.

Plotkin uses sound as well as visual details to build the tension: a
bush gives way with a &quot;small snap,&quot; the tree falls with a &quot;splintering
crash&quot; after the &quot;Crack!&quot; of thunder--and the dizzy rush of detail
among all the concurrent events produces a whirling, desperate
confusion. Though we get little of the protagonist's thoughts, it
seems plausible to support that he or she is somewhat less than calm,
and the author does his utmost to transfer the growing sense of panic
to the player. When lightning dazzles you and leaves you in the dark
again, you &quot;blink furiously, trying to sort out the shadows from
what's really there.&quot; That connotes both the sensory struggle--night
vision shattered in a flash of light--but also the urgency; your task
is sufficiently pressing that you try to blink away the afterimages
and keep moving, lest you waste valuable time. For the most part,
Plotkin is content to show the details rather than telling the player
how to feel, and the few exceptions--digging a trench, you &quot;claw
desperately&quot; at the earth--are well placed.

The author notes that this is a &quot;cruel&quot; game, and he doesn't
exaggerate: it is virtually impossible to solve it on the first try,
or even on the first ten tries. Making every move count is one form of
cruelty, and the writing is good enough (and the mood sufficiently
pervasive) that the game doesn't get dull even after many
repetitions. Another form of cruelty--a required action in the first
half of the game which is much less than obvious, and which is clued
rather subtly--is less successful, to my mind, because it weakens the
game's logic: it's one thing to have to make sense of a wide variety
of concurrent events, it's another to make an intuivie leap that a key
object is hidden in a strange place. The sense in the second half,
even when I failed to think of something vital on the proper move, was
that, well, if I'd been really thinking, I would have known that. And
other elements, the &quot;magic realism&quot; feel--the fox's remarkable
prescience, a certain change that the rain couldn't logically
cause--don't break the logic, somehow, because they seem only just
outside the realm of usual possibilities; they seem like the sort of
things we feel could happen easily enough, given a minor incursion of
the supernatural. It's hardly less logical that the interlocking parts
of the game come together in the way they do, after all, but the
player isn't about to question that; likewise, the magical bits
require only the sorts of suspension of disbelief that a player is
happy to make anyway. Moreover, certain bits of the game that can't
quite be put down to magic remain speculative at the end, perhaps
intentionally so; a Zarf game wouldn't be a Zarf game if everything
were fully explained (or even explainable).

The charm of Change in the Weather, for me at least, lies in the way
it infuses a relatively ordinary setting with such a range of
feelings: from pleasant sunset to violent, ominous night storm to
placid dawn, the same locations are rewritten to instill different
moods. Like all good writers, Plotkin is sparing with the adjectives
and more often uses verbs to produce the desired effect:

    You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the
    west. Beyond the trees and brush, meadows glow in the thickening
    sunlight. Behind you stands the last stony lump of hill. A narrow
    trail curves away to the northwest.

The various elements of the scene are given personality by &quot;rolling&quot;
and &quot;glowing&quot; and such, and the impression of a peaceful sunlit scene
is clear enough that more description isn't necessary. Likewise, after
sundown:

    A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. A black expanse
    stretches to the north and west, impenetrable with rain. Every few
    moments, a directionless flicker of lightning tries to pull detail
    from the darkness; but there is only mist.

Again, elements of the scenery get active verbs rather than simply
being described, and the adjectives are placed to convey something
essential rather than simply piling on the description: the
&quot;directionless&quot; lightning illustrates how the flash comes from and
leads nowhere in particular, the &quot;impenetrable&quot; darkness limits the
immediate range of vision. The best atmospheric effects are those that
aren't obviously trying to be, and in that respect, Change in the
Weather succeeds--and, as in Wishbringer, only minor changes are
necessary to convey the developments in the landscape.

Though its scope is more limited than that of So Far, Change in the
Weather is accomplished in its own right. Even if &quot;cruel&quot;, it's
successful both as a puzzle-solving challenge and as an evocative
setting.

VERSION: 5.75

The latest Star Trek movie, Nemesis, is a great movie. But only if you
like Star Trek movies. If, for one instant, you were to view it
critically and compare it to a truly great film (an exercise left to the
reader), you would come away feeling that Nemesis wasn't worth seeing
even if the theaters paid people to see it and threw the popcorn in too.
If you *like* Star Trek, on the other hand, and are able to completely
ignore any technological problems and gaping plot inconsistencies, you
will like the movie.

Chateu Le Mont by Paul Panks is a text adventure written in BASIC. If
you like BASIC adventures, with their simplicity of plot, the occasional
bug, and complete lack of character development, not to mention the
amazingly simple one-line room "descriptions," then you will like Chateu
Le Mont. All it takes is the ability to recognize the game for what it
is, and play it for those qualities. 

For whatever reason, I was able to get into Chateu Le Mont and really
ended up liking it. Of course, a lot of that is because the feel of the
gameplay from its "kill everything because it is there" mentality to its
plug-and-chug combat to its "pick a spell, any spell" magic system is
quite reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons, and I really like Dungeons
and Dragons. You have hit points, an armor class, and a level, and you
gain experience points for killing anyone or anything. All of the
"monsters" are regenerated at the start of each new "day," and that
includes any townspeople you might have killed, so feel free to hack
away. Hey, that villager has 167 hit points compared to my 100! 

So, your purpose in Chateu Le Mont is to kill a vampire, who lives south
of town. So far, so good. You spend a good bit of time flailing about
the town, until you figure out where to get a weapon and some armor, and
what happens when you die (you are resurrected every time). This is the
point at which you learn you can die from dehydration, and that drinking
from the well doesn't help your dehydration, but the fountain does. 

The dehydration death is just one of many "sins" of Chateu Le Mont,
although at least it doesn't have a maze. There's a light problem, and
figuring out how to turn on the lantern is a guess-the-verb puzzle all
on its own (although it shouldn't be -- I'm just not used to trying the
verb "use" -- and that shouldn't be considered a spoiler, it should be
called a blessing to modern IFers). Other "sins" include the parser
pretending to understand things that it doesn't: WEAR (to give a random
example) SHOES gives "You can't wear that" when what it *really* means
is "You can't see any such thing" or "You must be holding an item before
you can wear it." There are a ton of useless locations that are a little
tricky to map at first. There are actions that make the game unwinnable
with no logic and no warning. And, last of the major "sins," the player
has to depend on randomness (in the form of the fighting system) to win
the game.

There are a few strange bugs which seem not to affect gameplay much. For
instance, whenever you find some gold, the gold remains wherever it was,
meaning you can pick it up again, and again, until the limits of your
patience run out (or some kind of overflow -- I wonder what the integer
limit is?), racking up all the gold you can stand. Unfortunately, there
is nothing exciting to buy with the gold except items you brought to the
store yourself, and the shopkeeper never marks up his prices, so it's
always a straight exchange.

Another odd bug that does affect gameplay is that when you save your
game, quit, and restore it, you are knocked back to level 1. I think the
hit points remain, but upon perusing the source code I found that you
must be level 7 before you can go after the vampire in his own house, so
the save/restore bug could be an annoyance. The source code really came
in handy on this one, by the way, although I was unable to effectively
change the annoying inventory limit.

Finally, the first time I fought the vampire, the vampire cursed me and
made the stake disappear. I can't kill the vampire without the stake,
and it was nowhere to be found. I have no idea why this happened, and
ended up replaying to finish the game.

All in all, this is a fun little game that may amuse, depending on your
tastes. The "problems" I've touched on speak for themselves: if you can
look past them, and like random combat, go ahead and have a good time
with Chateu Le Mont! However, I would recommend just another shot or two
of originality from the author the next time around. I mean... a hobbit?
And did the vampire HAVE to be named Count Dracula?

P.S. I finished with 14932 points. Can you beat that?

Um. 

So, does anyone disagree that this game contains the best writing of any
game in the comp? Oh, you do? Hrm. Well, I think you're wrong. See, I'm
not talking about the oh-so-very-hip ranting patter, or the universe of
next year's slang, but rather about the frequent turns of phrase that
make you say, "Yes! See, this is why language was invented." I'm talking
about strings of words that are: (a) new, never before seen by either
myself or Ezra Pound; (b) interesting, containing words one wouldn't
expect to see together, yet which somehow match; and (c) evocative,
creating a very precise mental image. Phrases like: 

* "bathed in a honeycomb" Bathing in honey is vaguely interesting as an
  image, but it brings to mind a marquise in the court of Louis XVI
  reading "Tales of Ribaldry"; bathing in a huge-ass honeycomb, on the
  other hand, is both fresher and more specific, beautiful in its own way
  yet bizarre enough to avoid becoming saccharine.

* "chunks of desperate bride" "Bride" is a fairly charged word, and
  "desperate" is on the powerful side in its own right -- putting the two
  together is a nice afternoon's work, but sticking "chunks of" in front
  makes for an impressive coup de grace. And it even teaches some
  valuable life lessons: nothing jams up blender blades like pieces of 
  Lisa.

* "enough bad habits to poorly clothe every single nun on the continent"
  Without "poorly", this is lame. With it, it's freakin' hilarious.

And yeah, as that last entry indicates, this is clearly someone who has
the goods. Discipline can be learned; much harder to learn is precisely
why "yellowjackets" is the only word that will work in a certain spot
and "bees" or "hornets" just will not do. 

Sherwin also has his comedic chops down pat. The early line about the
sneezing, the late line about getting out of bed in the morning... these
are just a couple lines I'm finding randomly flipping through the TXD
dump. There's one on every screen. Did I laugh, as with <a href = "k.html#king">King Arthur</a>?
Nah. It's a different kind of comedy. The King Arthur brand I laugh at,
then forget; this is the sort that makes me sort of pause and nod and
think, "Hmm -- that's *really* funny. Have to remember that one." 

Moving outward, what about the game beyond sentence level? Here things
aren't quite as strong. The instincts are good: combining disparate
elements is usually a reasonably reliable formula for success.
Graverobbers have been done; singles bars have been done; but
graverobbers at singles bars? That's a new one (and a fricking *great*
one.) I didn't even mind the left turn between the bar scene and the
cemetery scene. But things do fall apart a bit after the bar scene draws
to a close; the cutscene is just ridiculously overlong, and the sequence
that follows is sort of a train wreck -- but hey, at least that implies
the existence of a speeding train, rather than a Ford Aspire sputtering
up a hill. And it is nice that so much of the game is character-based
rather than centered around fixing air conditioners and such. The fact
that the characters come off as characters rather than switch statements
is an especially nice bonus. 

That said -- you can have all the talent in the world, and you're still
not going to turn out anything more than promising slush unless you
buckle down and acquire the discipline referred to earlier. I would have
loved to give this game a ten, but the sad fact is that it's buggier
than a corpse left out in a swamp for three days. I understand the time
constraints of the comp, but still, weird time-loop bugs and
unfinishable climaxes are just not the sort of things that even a
forgiving reviewer can completely overlook. In the end, the author ends
up looking like a playground hoops legend: you can dazzle with your
talent and jazzy crossover and whatnot, but you've got to put in a whole
different kind of work to make the pros. 

A footnote: this is one of *two* Comp99 games set in Fort Collins,
Colorado. New York or Los Angeles or London I could understand as the
settings for multiple games -- hell, even Seattle I could see -- but
*Fort Collins*?? 

Score: EIGHT.

NAME: Christminster

"Upon this Oath that I shall heere you give..." The seventeenth-century
verse that begins Christminster brings on tingles, dropping the
interactor directly into an atmosphere of ancient secrecy, a world where
mysteries must be unlocked. It becomes smoothly evident that the main
character, Christabel, is an outsider: She's come to visit her brother
at all-male Biblioll College, which seems rather shut off from the
surrounding town and happens to be completely closed today. The
situation is more quotidian than the epigraphical quotation suggests,
but, being sure of conspiracy inside, the interactor's curiosity is
provoked.

Christ! How is Christabel to get into Christminster's cloistered college
on the Lord's day? <a href = "#christfn1">[FOOTNOTE 1]</a> More critically, what will she do when
she finds that brother seems to have been engaged in forbidden research,
and is now missing?

The college is populated with particularly rich characters who play
their parts well through the usual sorts of text-adventure interactions.
There are good excuses to interact with them along the way, too,
provided by a plot which twists along past different personalities. Rees
has said that his puzzles are contrived for the purpose of drawing the
interactor through the story and into contact with different characters,
and that is evident in Christminster. Areas of the setting are
consecutively unlocked for exploration, but the whole college is worked
into the story very evenly, throughout the narrative.

That said, the actions required to unlock the college and the secrets
within are, as is so often the case in interactive fiction, convoluted.
The general nature of the challenges that Christabel faces do fit in
well with the situations of the story. The artifice of puzzles is
visible, though, and sometimes tugs against the authorial and narrative
voice. Although challenging, the solutions to the puzzles are plausible,
in the context of current interactive fiction -- and the puzzles are
quite well-crafted, as one would expect from Rees's <a href = "m.html#magictoy">The Magic Toyshop</a> --
but to actually solve them the interactor must shift away from reading
and exploration to worry about waiting a number of turns, crossing
different-colored wires, and decrypting enciphered text. This is often
the case with interactive fiction. The nice thing about Christminster is
that, aside from its interlocking challenges, there is some good reading
and exploration to be done.

In some ways Christminster might be held up against with <a href = "l.html#lurk">The Lurking
Horror</a> -- the university setting and occult mysteries being the obvious
points of comparison. There are important differences. <a href = "#christfn2">[FOOTNOTE 2]</a> The
main character in Christminster is unfamiliar with the campus, which
fits in with the interactor actually having no previous knowledge of the
fictional college. Importantly, Christminster is more populated than The
Lurking Horror. The life of the university is still going on, even if at
a Sunday pace.

How the revelation of the conspiracy occurs, and what actually happens
in Christminster, is most fascinating. The writing in which these events
are described does not shine, but the descriptive text in Christminster
is clear. Objects in the environment, and the behaviors of those
objects, are well-defined and aptly described. A few commands elicit
responses that ring a bit false -- ">pet the parrot. Keep your hands to
yourself!" -- but the interaction is, overall, well-constructed. For
those concerned with allowing more English-like interaction,
Christminster does not advance the state of the art. It would help to be
able to "leave" a room that has only one exit, for instance. As is
conventional, compass directions are required for movement through most
locations.

At times the objective description in Christminster yields and the
emotions of the main character are described. This does little, for the
most part -- "Your heart sinks as you look around this room." -- but
sometimes it adds a bit of color: "It is a hot summer's day in
Christminster, the kind of day that makes you think of strawberries and
cream and punting on the river."

Rees excellently ties together the acquisition of keys and the advance
through locations with quotations from alchemical literature and from
Coleridge's "Christabel." Although it may seem a minor element, it links
the work to the world of literature strongly, and draws the interactor
deeper into the mysteries of the college. The quoted material is not as
thematically meaningful as are the excepts in <a href = "t.html#trinity">Trinity</a>, but these texts
build up the rich and enveloping atmosphere of this work.

Christminster overcomes more than a few of the obstacles that keep
casual gamers and readers unfamiliar with the form from enjoying
interactive fiction. The map in Christabel's bag, for instance, is
nicely rendered in ASCII graphics on-screen. This makes pencil-and-paper
map-making unnecessary, removing one encumbrance for those who are new
to the form. Although some of the puzzles are challenging, the
compelling story and fairly well-developed interaction makes
Christminster a good work to introduce readers to interactive fiction.
<a href = "#christfn3">[FOOTNOTE 3]</a>

Overall, Christminster has both gaming and literary merits. The two
halves of the work could, perhaps, fit together better, and particular
aspects of the work might have been honed further. Amazingly, though,
both the overarching narrative and the puzzle set provided are
exemplary. This, along with several important smaller touches, makes
Christminster a work of lasting value, of interest to both veterans of
<a href = "s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</a> and readers of the conspiratorial Pynchon and Eco.

I'm biased, I'll admit it.

But every longtime IF player, I think, must have a special soft spot for
at least one game. Even though you know it's probably not the very best
game out there, you're very forgiving with these games that live in your
soft spot because they worked for you on a level that is hard to
replicate. For me, Christminster is one of those games. Games which I
have finished get unconsciously compared to 'Minster in deciding whether
or not they are worthy enough to reside permanently on my hard drive in
dim hopes of being replayed. And yet I have replayed this game twice.
Why?

For starters, the setting is a rich one. I'm not positive if the game is
patterned after Oxford directly, but there is a Christ Church college
there, and from pictures that I have seen of it, I can believe this was
the inspiration for the surroundings in the game. No room or location is
out of place. It all seems in keeping with what you might expect at an
Oxford college a few decades ago... er... except for the magic potions
and the like. This little academic world provides plenty to do despite
only a moderate sized map.

Now, there have been quite a few other college games: <a href = "s.html#princeton">Save Princeton</a>,
Veritas, and PCU come to mind. In each case, the cliche aspects of dorm
life are highlighted in a jokey manner, with a sort of jump through the
hoops plot. Christminster largely avoids that, using the college more as
a backdrop for a web of intrigue than anything else. Your job is to find
your brother and save him.

There are so many fantastic elements in this game, it's hard to review
them all. The NPCs were what impressed me the most. There is the Master
of the college, who appears to be a generator of stock replies, but can
actually be asked about a host of topics (many of which, ironically,
won't be informative enough to help you). There is Professor Wilderspin,
who is completely in character in utterly blowing you off until you
figure out what will engage his attention. There are the villains, who
are plainly identifiable as being the bad guys early on. They do exhibit
some complex behavior in attempting to thwart you, generating some good
dialog at key moments (many of which are just before you either win or
lose the game).

But above all is Edward, the student who'll be most helpful to you in
your quest. He's chattery in a quaint way, and forlorn in a way that
makes you feel pretty smart as the PC at times. The subplot of having to
help Edward find his pet bird is ingenious, and gives character not only
to him as an NPC, but indirectly to you as the PC. It is one of those
puzzles that feels less like a puzzle because it's so integrated into
the plot. Part of this is because it recurs a couple of times.

Certain key puzzles define almost all games, and leave a lasting
impression. Here, one that comes to mind is figuring out the phone
wiring. Getting through dinner without any gaffes in etiquette was
another, again with a lot of dialog interwoven so that the atmosphere
feels less straightforwardly puzzlish. The puzzle most associated with
Christminster, though, has to be the street magician from the opening
sequence. The magician spews so much text that it's hard to determine
what kind of NPC interactions are going to be needed to solve it at
first. You have to sit and observe (and unfortunately, restart) to
figure out what is going on. The author has said that this was the
hardest part of the game to program, and I can't help but wonder if it
got away from him more than he wanted it to. This puzzle is just harder
than it should have been for being this early in the game. It warped my
expectations of how hard the rest of the game would be. Nonetheless, it
is a rewarding puzzle in the end-- once you've saved and restored a few
(dozen) times to nail down what is going on.

Although there are a number of specialized elements in the plot, the
results are not overwhelming. Very few cases involve utterly novel
situations that send you into guessing verbs. Once you've gained access
to the college after the tricky opening sequence, you're free to pursue
a number of avenues simultaneously, with no single puzzle being
ridiculous in nature. The in-game hint system is reasonably
well-developed too. Some tricky puzzles do occur late in the game, with
sufficient obscurity as to challenge most any player. But it's
engrossing and immersive enough that few players who get that far are
likely to quit altogether.

It is clear from playing the game that it has been through extensive
beta testing that refined the surroundings and ensured that a lot of
touches were added to avoid stock responses at virtually every turn.
What's more, interspersed with the plot are poetic undertones here and
there, taken from various books you encounter in your research in the
game. In terms of writing, this game is strong-- despite the absence of
a directly story-driven plot (this was 1995). Instead, the plot in this
game is uncovered slowly by exploration and sleuthing.

Alas, in any game, there are always things that could have been better.
There are a few infuriating aspects to Christminster that I could have
done without. For instance, after the initial information collection
that goes on, there is too much subsequent lookup of books and facts
through the library. The indexing feature just seems overused. It's
realistic to the story, at least, but in general, I find that if in-game
reference materials have to be used more than a few times, I am bored
with the device. Also, the story itself begins to get a bit convoluted
after a while. Another thing is that there are too many containers late
in the game, and they are tough to keep track of without botching your
eventual objective. Minor sins, really.

The thing I liked the least is that the game can be made unwinnable in
subtle enough ways that the player can go on for quite a while unaware
of the situation. In this regard, Christminster is probably a bit more
fragile than it should be. In all, though, the small cracks don't mar
the soundness of the game. The overall game design is as tight and
sensible as just about anything I've seen. Christminster certainly makes
my top five of all time, and stands as a classic. I suspect it will hold
up well under the test of time. One hallmark of such games is that they
make it hard to release a new game with a similar setting, plot, or
milieu because the author has so well nailed it down. That seems to be
the case here for college campuses and Christminster.

VERSION: Release 2

Part of the charm of the IF competition is that it brings out
interesting ideas, ideas which might not be suitable for a full-
length game but do something interesting that contributes to the IF
oeuvre in one way or another. The converse, however, is that having a
forum for short games may discourage authors from developing stories
as completely as they might.  Sam Barlow's The City is a case in
point: it has an interesting idea, but in its present form, there
isn't much more than an idea, and the result is rather unsatisfying to
play.

The premise, though suspiciously reminiscent of <a href = "d.html#delusions">Delusions</a>, is
reasonably well done. You're trapped in a room with no way out and a
video recorder and tape on hand; the tape shows a man taking a pill;
you accept a pill from a handy assistant, take it, and black out;
repeat. The man in the tape is, of course, you; your goal is to break
out of the loop and see what you find. Unfortunately, you don't find
much, and you certainly don't find much that's surprising, and it
isn't clear that anything you do goes to accomplish anything. (Being
trapped in a nightmare laboratoryish sequence is starting to feel a
little familiar as an IF premise; the IF world may be getting
overloaded with bizarre dystopias, though that certainly isn't
Mr. Barlow's fault.) Now, if a sense of futility is the point here, IF
is ideal for conveying that. Ain't nothin' more frustrating than IF
that goes in circles. However, as noted, Delusions already did that
pretty well, even if the resolution was different. More importantly,
sheer futility generally does not a satisfying experience make, IF
experience included. Likewise, there's a point toward the end where
there's only one action available, and it's fairly obvious that you
don't &quot;really&quot; want to take that action--but there's no way around
it. (<a href = "p.html#piece">Piece of Mind</a>, from the 1996 competition, did something
similar--but, IMHO, much more satisfyingly.) The game keeps you from
doing plenty of obvious things without explanation, which certainly
hits the frustration angle--but it's frustration with the mechanics of
the game, not with the situation depicted. (Okay, you can argue that
it's all one. But merging the character's frustration with the
player's does not produce a fun game.)
 
The problem is that, really, The City doesn't do enough with its
premise.  The backstory never really shows up, and backstory is what
might have distinguished this from its many predecessors; if there
were some interesting story behind how things became how they are, the
game might stay with the player for more than a few moments after
playing. There's painfully little to do once you _do_ break out; the
&quot;outside&quot; world isn't any more interesting than the &quot;inside.&quot; The
futility idea might be more interesting if there were a stronger
illusion of control, but there isn't much; you can't get very far, and
you can't get anywhere appealing. The City needs to be about twice as
long as it is in order to involve the player in the story; as it is,
it ends almost as soon as it starts.  Moreover, whereas Delusions
mixed its futility with a sense of urgency owing to frequent and short
time limits, The City eschews all time requirements--in other words,
you are never required to take a pill--which means frustration is
mixed with, if anything, boredom.

Technically, everything works well enough, apart from the failure to
provide logical choices at certain points. The author disabled undo
and save/restore to no particularly vital purpose, as far as I can
tell; if the idea was to remind us that we're at the mercy of other
folks and can't do much about our own fate, well, we weren't likely to
forget, save/restore or not. Still, there are no technical problems to
speak of, and in fact one rather complicated aspect of The City is
handled well: the tape that records you actually does play back
whatever you did last time around, and describes your actions
reasonably well. (On the other hand, there's not a lot you can do
anyway.) There are some other odd features--none of the rooms have
names, for some reason, though they are distinctly different
rooms. (Perhaps the idea was to suggest that you can't really get
anywhere, but it's rather confusing at first.) There's no status line,
no opening title, no compass directions, etc., and the minimalism
doesn't distract much from the game; in that respect, The City works
well enough.

Still, there isn't much here that anything could distract anyone from,
and besides a few gripping moments--on the roof, notably-- it's a
rather frustrating experience. It's technically sound enough that I
gave it a 7, but it doesn't make much of what might have been an
intriguing game.

I played this game once and didn't get very far. So later came back to
it, armed with some hints. The game is quite small, but with a thought
provoking plot, a bit George Orwell 1984ish. Some puzzles were fairly
easy, others not so. It was difficult to work out what you were
supposed to do next and whether the plot had actually advanced. I know
for a fact that I would never have completed it without hints, not in
a million million years

VERSION: 3

My overall impression of this game was very good. Short's
characteristically strong coding and writing combine for a great
experience, and I found no notable bugs in this release. 

From a purely technical standpoint, the work is a gem. Short has again
used her resource-intensive ask-tell/menu hybrid conversation system.
There are two difficulty settings and various options to set up the
conversation system and the graphics to suit a variety of tastes. There
is an impressive amount of detail in the descriptions with nearly all
first level objects implemented and many second and third level as well.
Such extras as your complementary personal shampoo from the hotel are
fully implemented, which gives the world a solid feeling. The City seems
to be an actual place rather than merely the setting for a game. The
superb map design also contributes to this feeling. The city is
represented as 20 or so rooms, but between the graphical map that you
have available and the intuitive layout of the main thoroughfares travel
is easy. She has also admirably succeeded in giving the different
sectors of the City a unique feel. A quick glance at the room name will
tell you whether you are in Malta or May Street and thus what to expect
from your surroundings.

The writings is, as I said before, also up to Short's usual high
standards. Once the plot got rolling I could see the main twist coming
but resisted it because of my personal convictions. (This also seemed
perfectly in character for the PC.) However, as details emerged I was
slowly won over, against my will, as it were, to the other side. That
Short could pull this off, even while I was aware of it, is a testament
to the immersive effect of the prose and the real emotional impact of
the characters. 

However, this work is not perfect. None are. And in this case, the weakest
link is the plot. It is well written and paced, in my opinion, but more
predictable and linear than I would have preferred. In particular I was
not able to derail it by personal choice, as far as I could tell. My
choices were generally to advance the plot or to continue wandering
about the City. I was unable to find a way to take decisive action
according to my own judgment, only as the story dictated. The exception
to this is the climatic move in the snowstorm. In this case, however, I
was too dense to figure out why my options have the effects they do. I
know that it is supposed to be mysterious but it would be nice if saving
the world depended on more than a guess. 

In summary, City of Secrets is a fine game that demonstrates not only
Short's preeminence in the field but also the way that writing and
atmosphere can carry a game rather than devilish puzzles or
breathtakingly new plot.

First off, an issue that arises, I suspect, because I am using a
curses-based text-only Glulx interpreter: the about system is horrible,
and so are all the menus in the game. It's probably not the author's
fault, but it's her decision to use it. I couldn't work out how to
escape the menus and restarted (hurray for Control-C!) resolving never
to use the menu. Maybe you'll have better luck if you're not so much of
a stick-in-the-mud text-only sort of person. Aside from a permanent
display of "Glk library error: set_hyperlink: hyperlinks not supported."
it didn't affect the game play (except that I had to resist using the
help menu).

Be a tourist in a city you never intended visiting. Miss your best
friend's wedding. Get a guided tour from one of the native lunatics. Get
robbed. Become a secret agent. Flirt with a mysteriously attractive and
secretive woman. Learn about magic. Talk to a lot of people.

The action takes place in a city. You arrive there on you way to your
friend's wedding after the train you are on breaks down. It is a city
where technology is fused with magic (or should that be opposed to?).
The city is a melting pot of oppositions (or at least, opposites): magic
and technology; old and new; autocracy and democracy; austere and
opulent. The implementation of the (small) city is incredibly well done.
For immersion, I would say that City of Secrets is state of the art.

The city bustles. People pass you by in their own conversations, they
jostle you, they look in shop windows, they get on and off the city's
trolley system (I haven't discovered a way to use the trolley system,
you don't have a pass). This is all done with randomly generated
descriptions of people and actions. The programming of this is really
well done (and must have been a bit tedious at times); various events in
the story will change the mood of the city and the way people act and
react changes accordingly. A typical example is: "A cheerful lady
wanders along, arm in arm with a well-built older fellow." I was
initially impressed, and then, after discovering that you can't really
interact with any of these people, disappointed. I was impressed again
when I discovered how things changed as the story progressed. Obviously
one can't hope to provide any accurate emulation of a city, but in City
of Secrets we see a pretty good approximation using the technology of
today.

One or two things (near the beginning of the game) stood out as a little
odd, as if programmed on the cheap. In any other game I wouldn't have
bothered mentioning them, but because of the depth of interaction that
City of Secrets generally gives us, my expectations were raised. There's
no opportunity to tip the bell-hop, and "run bath" executes an entire
bath sequence (running the water, getting undressed, waiting for the
bath to fill, washing, getting out, etc) in one move. I was rather
looking forward to a bit of a splash around in the bath (but evidently
the PC wasn't).

Your mental state is displayed in the lower window alongside the room
description, like this: "Outside Train Station, Wandering around,
Tired". This initially annoyed me. I found the author's attempts to make
me feel the PC's tiredness clumsy. Or at least, displaying it in the
status window is clumsy. Thankfully it's not the author's only device.
Having arrived at a hotel I examine a travel brochure: "A rather pretty
brochure with a map and color pictures. There is writing, too, but it
just seems to swim around, thanks to your current state of fatigue."
That kind of thing seems spot on and just what it's like to arrive in a
place that you never intended to visit. After a while I got used to the
display and it didn't bother me at all.

After half-an-hour or so, I was asking myself, "What's the point?". I
kept on playing for three reasons: 1) it's called City of Secrets, 2)
it's by Emily Short, and 3) I had already decided to write a review of
it. In the end, I'm glad I did. It took me 3.5 hours on my first play
through and I played it through again only to discover that my first
play through wasn't an entirely successful one (but it nearly was).

It soon becomes clear that there is a conflict in the city, a conflict
between the Illuminated Ones and the Gnostics, the city's opposing
political/religious sects. You get to play a significant part in this
conflict. Initially, your part starts out as a sort of investigation,
but as you learn more about the city, its characters, and its magic it
becomes clear that you can (and must?) step outside your initial brief.
Most of the time, you'll be talking to people and reading things to gain
various clues. There's a vast amount of text in this game. I have given
up all hope of experiencing the "whole" game. I'm still discovering
significant new things on my third play-through.

Talking to NPCs is done with a combination of a menu system and a topic.
You initiate a conversation with a greeting like "GREET CONCIERGE," and
can then either choose one of the conversational options presented on
the menu or try a new topic of conversation such as "TOPIC FOOD". It
works fairly well. I think it provides a good balance between the
author's obvious desire to constrain the topics of conversation and the
player's ability to pick any topic for discussion. Sometimes you can
lose a conversational option for apparently no good reason. EG I had
only one option left on my conversation option card (about shopping). I
typed "how", a non sequitur, just to see how the game would respond,
"(You can think of nothing to say.)", and the option was removed from my
card (now empty). Most of the people you meet are prepared to talk about
a lot of things though their opinions on some topics, the fortress and
food most notably, seem to be drawn from a common pool giving me the
impression that some of the lesser characters are punched-out from the
same die. The way the conversation progresses influences your standing
with the NPCs; you can turn them against you or earn their favour (to
some extent). The "AMUSING" section points to some very strange
consequences that can happen, only one of which I found before
completing the game and none of them I have managed since (not that I've
tried that hard). Occasionally this conversation system stumbles;
selecting a topic can initiate a conversation about something
surprisingly different, but it's a forgivable minor flaw in such an
ambitious system. You can recall your impressions of people with
"REMEMBER CONCIERGE" which gives you a summary of what you have learned
(mostly from other people) about the person in question. I like it.

The writing is excellent. I had previously played, and enjoyed,
<a href = "m.html#meta">Metamorphoses</a> (also by Emily Short) and was somewhat put off by the
excessively flowery language (no, I mean I was overwhelmed by a
sumptuous filigree of syntax which sparkled with every twist and turn of
the light that shone upon it). City of Secrets has plainer language
wielded with the same skill. I found it a change for the better.
Occasionally the descriptions are overwhelming -- one simply has too
much text to read, and it sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish
the set from the game, though I suspect that's rather the point. To my
surprise I did find a couple of genuine mistakes: "pier" instead of
"buttress" (correct, but obscure. Or is this a feature of North American
English?); confusing "glassine" with "glassy" (poetic license? I hope
not). The occasional misused punctuation mark. The very few mistakes
don't seem to be due to lack of attention more perhaps that the writer
is stretching herself beyond her ability. On the other hand, City of
Secrets is a much bigger work than Metamorphoses so perhaps it is just
down to the problem of proofreading this vast text.

There are a couple of dream sequences. I was initially quite excited at
the prospect of an interactive dream sequence, but they proved to be
less interactive than I had hoped (on a level with <a href = "l.html#lurk">Lurking Horror</a>).
They're more like slightly surreal infodumps. Still they do add
character and they're not just dream sequences foisted upon you because
the author wanted you to know something and couldn't think of anything
less clumsy. They have a proper part to play in the story and are
integrated well.

Wandering around the city and chatting to people is quite fun and
sometimes almost feels adventurous as you wander into increasingly
dilapidated parts of town. There's plenty of people to talk to, and
quite a lot of things to read (more and more text!), but not all that
much to do (though the "AMUSING" section clearly indicates that I didn't
even scratch the surface). Overall the game is fairly easy (which is
intended), the puzzles being reasonably straightforward.

I discover that there are some nice attempts to help the absolute
beginner along. For example, if the first thing you do is press enter at
the prompt you receive a little spiel about the prompt and simple
instructions.

The story branches. I haven't fully explored to what extent, but I'm
already impressed at the different branches that I have seen. I strongly
suspect that there are different endings (probably according to which
faction in the city you ally yourself to), but I haven't had the
tenacity or patience to find them.

Jumping zorkmids! I just noticed that the download is over 6 Megabytes!
I suppose that includes pictures (which I haven't seen as I played it on
a text-only interpreter).

Overall it's an excellent game. It's not a puzzle-fest; it's not
supposed to be. It's a conversation-fest. You can chat to (and "up" to
some extent) a large number of NPCs who are all intelligently
programmed. The way that the story unfolds is very well done, with
different NPCs (and some books) filling in different parts of the canvas
with their own style. To be honest it's not my cup of tea -- I prefer
puzzles (like Metamorphoses), but I have no problems recommending this
game to anyone.

VERSION: 1.0

Almost as bad as no lead-in is too much lead-in. Worse yet is if the
wodges of text come larded with misused words and misplaced apostrophes.
For instance, we learn at the beginning of this game, amid a great deal
of family history and implied mystery, that grandpa felt "little
remorse" at grandma's funeral; but remorse would only be suitable,
really, if he'd offed the old biddy himself (surely not!).

The whole of the game is flawed in similar ways: misused words, abused
apostrophes, simple game-design carelessness. Descriptive sections
include such things as:

   You see the first photograph, the second photograph, the third
   photograph, and the fourth photograph here.

Why not label them as to content, or introduce them more subtly? I think
I detect, in many places in this game, indications that the authors are
relatively new to TADS, and that they are comfortable doing the
straightforward tasks but uncertain about the customizing nuances that
smooth over awkward bits.

The puzzles are also generally not very exciting, and mostly consist of
finding things and applying them, without that much by way of reward
offered for diligence. My strongest puzzle-related memory from this game
is that I drove myself crazy trying to get into a certain section which
was sort of but not entirely off-limits: I could enter it, but a timed
sequence of events would drive me out again. There was, of course, a
solution to this, but I didn't know enough about the game to know for
certain that the solution wasn't to be found *inside* the area that I
kept being forced out of. So I made many frustratingly brief exploratory
missions before I finally gave up, consulted the walkthrough, and
discovered that the correct way of dealing with the problem lay
somewhere else entirely in an area I was not yet aware of. I would
complain even more strenuously if the game design *had* necessitated
repeated trips into the semi-restricted area; as it was, it was just my
own stubbornness and failure to explore another puzzle adequately that
had me rushing back in there over and over. But I still don't
particularly care for this effect, I'm afraid.

Story and atmosphere were likewise mostly unexceptional, with a few
standout bits. Some of the most endearing features were things that I
assume are accurate observations of the real coast house on which this
is modelled. I ordinarily don't care for real-life details when said
real-life details are, e.g., a careful implementation of your television
and VCR: I know how those behave and derive no joy from manipulating
them in virtual form. Perhaps what sets this apart from other
implementations of well-known places is that I have not, in fact, ever
spent that much time at a vacation house like this one, so it struck me
as peculiar and intriguing. I was oddly touched by the Piggly Wiggly
bag.

The backstory itself, as finally revealed, seemed tonally out of place,
or at least to belong to a different mood from the rest of the game.

Summary: An unambitious little game with some nice atmospheric touches,
lacking a lot in surface polish.

I love this game.

This is old-fashioned puzzle goodness. You are sent to investigate the
disappearance of a colony, missing from an alien planet. Eating a suspicious
bird egg &#8211; for no good reason other than an irresistible urge &#8211; puts you into a
surreal, alternate reality. I did something similar way back in the &#8217;99
competition. It was met with mixed reactions.

You must be thinking &#8220;Great. Another one. Everything is all random and unreal,
but it&#8217;s all just part of the fantasy and that&#8217;s supposed to make it okay.&#8221;
That&#8217;s one way of looking at it. Yes, this does allow for some wacky encounters
in which animals (both real and mythical) talk and ask for help with personal
dilemmas. The puzzles are well-clued and not very difficult (aside from a
carrot-harvesting bit that&#8217;s optional anyway), and most importantly, the entire
game is fun. It&#8217;s really fun. This is what adventure gaming is all about.

I solved the game along one path (not realizing another was even possible)
without hints. The various endings are picked CYOA-style (following a CYOA
ending in the game I played just prior, Vendetta). I was left missing 5 points,
and a few objects/areas seemed unused. So, a peek at the hints, the after-game
notes, and finally the walkthrough put me onto an alternate path that not only
expands the enjoyment of the game, but actually changes much of the second half,
resulting in two additional endings.

The first two areas are quads that require no real mapping. The next area is
larger, but arranged in a pattern that looks pretty cool on paper. Another quad
underwater reflects some aspects of the &#8220;real&#8221; world, as does the interior of
the red tower. As was probably the author&#8217;s intent, no single ending seems like
the best or the most real, and it&#8217;s never quite clear how the things in the
alternate land (either of them, since there are two paths) relate to the
missing people or the lost inventory from the real world.

The writing in The Colour Pink isn&#8217;t particularly colorful or clever (although
it is pink in spots), lacking complicated metaphors and dense descriptions.
This keeps it unpretentious and more game-like than story-like. The focus is
always on the puzzles. I have little else to say about this game, except that I
highly recommend it to puzzle fans &#8211; especially those who like the easy,
traditional kind, where the gold key always opens the gold door and the carrot-
loving rabbit is always going to give you something good if you feed him.

As for the story, it&#8217;s not complicated, but it could be deeper than it seems.
I&#8217;m not sure why the pink theme was abandoned mid-way, nor why the love potion
was just a segue to the fantasy world. I&#8217;m basing the game at 9.0 on my scale,
skewing +0.5 for an &#8220;unofficial&#8221; 9.5 because I had so much fun playing.

VERSION: Release 2

It's not quite true that Stephen Granade's Common Ground goes somewhere
that no IF has gone before, because most of what it does has been done
in one form or another. Notably, <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> pioneered the changing-
perspectives aspect and, to some extent, the conversation system, <a href = "m.html#muse">Muse</a>
and a few others have made the plot turn on relationships more than on
any tangible goal, and--well, this is a no-spoiler review, but there are
other creative but not precisely novel elements. What's interesting
about Common Ground is that the various elements get put together in an
interesting way--and that the characters are well enough drawn that we
care, at least somewhat, about each one by the end.

There are four chapters in Common Ground, though the last chapter is
something of an epilogue: the heart of the game (work?) is the first
three chapters, each of which adopts the perspective of a different
character. The characters are Jeanie, a teenage girl who's as teenaged
as they come, her stepfather Frank and her mother Debbie, and the three
main chapters are all set in approximately the same time frame. Some of
the events are actually depicted twice, though not all of them, and you
get somewhat different takes on the relevant people and events in each
segment. The point actually isn't to adapt a Rashomon-style trick to IF,
wherein incompatible stories are told and the truth lies somewhere
between them, if anywhere; figuring out the truth is less the objective
here than understanding the characters and why they do what they do. The
result is susceptible to a variety of interpretations, in a few
respects--the player's sympathies may rest with one of the characters,
or all, or none, depending on what he or she makes of the various
exchanges. That aspect of Common Ground is particularly skillfully done,
in fact: playing the various characters gives a more nuanced look at the
situation than playing one character might, and an honest look at the
story more than likely leaves the player neither canonizing nor
demonizing any of the characters outright, which is as it should be.

A somewhat less successful aspect of Common Ground is the conversation
system. Granted, no one has come up with a successful IF conversation
system as such, but this one--"talk" says something preordained, and
continuing to type "talk" steers the character through the conversation
whether or not the player understands what's going on--isn't really any
more interactive than a cut scene, in that the player's only power over
what's going on is to walk away or do something else. In a way, that's
significant in this particular story--Jeanie in particular can make
statements by refusing to say anything--but as a conversation system,
it's more than a little clumsy. It's especially frustrating here because
the characters are fairly well developed--there are plenty of things to
ask them about-- and the "talk" straitjacket makes the game feel more
like reading a script than it should be.

I shouldn't exaggerate the straitjacket aspect, though, because there's
another aspect of Common Ground that works quite well: when you're done
playing Jeanie and you're seeing her through the eyes of the other
characters, you'll find that Jeanie does most of what you chose to have
her do when you were playing her. That is, the game records the
decisions you made and plays them back at you later. The same is true,
though less so, with Frank. Obviously, there are some complexities that
aren't acknowledged, but on the whole this works quite well and allows
for substantial replayability; better still, playing one character
differently elicits some revealing reactions from the other two. It's an
impressive technical feat--it was done on a reduced scale in Infocom's
<a href = "s.html#sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> and Sam Barlow's <a href = "#city">The City</a>, but this is much more thoroughly
implemented, and the various choices available do more for the story (in
that both the characters and the perceptions of them can change in a
variety of ways). If there's a fly in the ointment, it's that the game
doesn't really try to ensure that you did what the other characters saw
you do, beyond certain limitations--you can't go wandering around the
house, but you have the discretion to avoid certain conversations,
whether or not you had those conversations from the other side. Still,
on the whole, it's a successful gimmick.

Common Ground stands or falls on the character depictions, though, and
those depend to some extent on the player's reactions. The characters
initially seem a bit cliched--the angry teenager, the solicitous parent,
and to a lesser extent the left-out and unappreciated stepfather--and
while there's more to each of them than the cliches, that's not
necessarily immediately obvious. Moreover, depending on what the player
does with each character, the cliches might actually get reinforced;
there's enough freedom to allow for that--particularly so with Jeanie
and Frank (Debbie is a much less developed character). The details that
the author introduces to portray both the characters themselves and the
others' take on them are nicely done, as in this example from Jeanie's
perspective:

   As you come down the stairs, Frank looks up at you. "Goin' out
   tonight too, huh?" Is his speech slurred again?

Or this, from Frank's perspective:

   >talk to jeanie
   "I hated school, too.  Couldn't wait to graduate."

   "Yeah? Why'd you even bother? Not like you need a diploma to do
   factory work."

   Should of known better than to even try to talk to her.

Both snippets are revealing, both about the characters and about their
assumptions and prejudices, but a player too ready to categorize might
not pick up on the subtleties. The point is that while there's much more
to these characters than cliches, a given player might not realize
that--and if the player doesn't respond to the characters, he or she's
unlikely to enjoy Common Ground. In other words, the player should feel
some sympathies toward all of the three main characters, and arguably a
player who doesn't hasn't really given the story a fair shake, since
nothing is as simple as it first appears.

Common Ground is an unusual piece of IF, on the whole. There are no
puzzles to speak of, and no real objective--the point is to explore the
characters and see how they interact. While the result isn't successful
on every level, it's certainly a worthy experiment, implemented well,
and it's worth checking out.

   "I hope it is adequately stupid. Comments are appreciated."
                     -- Ian Haberkorn on Conan Kill Everything

Fear not, Ian! You game is most definitely "adequately stupid". Which is
meant in the best way possible, of course.

Though perhaps Ian Haberkorn is a bit confused about which competition
he entered with "Conan Kill Everything". When the title placed second in
StupidTitleComp (a voting mechanism test for the 2005 Spring Thing) he
seems to have thought he entered IntroComp, and created a playable game
with that title, possibly hoping to claim a prize before the year was
up. Alas, he will win nothing for creating this game other than the
renown for creating such an amusing, if small, game.

In this game you play the legendary Cimmerian barbarian, Conan, and your
objective is simple. Kill everything. No, not every living thing.
Everything. The walls of the room only escape Conan's mighty wrath
because they "are already dead. Conan suspects that he killed them in an
earlier episode."

Although a one room game, and as mentioned before, very short, some
interesting puzzles exist here. None will stymie a veteran IF player for
long, but they puzzles are fair and logical, if progressing to a logical
extreme. There's not much of a plot or story to speak off, but given the
source of the game, expecting one seems silly.

The game itself is technically sound, although more verbs could be
implemented as with most games, and what can be reached from the table
is perhaps a bit generous. Also, the actions of the fly in the room seem
to be a bit too random at times, which can make a long wait. The writing
is terse, tight phrasing emulating the 'action, not words' approach of
your average barbarian stereotype. This simplistic style actually
generates some of the humour, and there are also some great lines
sprinkled here and there.

Significantly, the game endings take a step back to a director's view of
the action as a movie, giving a view that this farce is something of a
play within a play. This decision actually helps, as some distance from
the absurdity keeps the player from getting too involved and turned off
by the stupidity of the main action. Not that these aren't amusing as
well.

The main complaint against the game is that it is, as I've said
repeatedly, quite short, finishable in less than half an hour even if
you get stuck at one point or another. More could certainly be added:
for instance, Conan's association with beautiful women is a significant
part of the mythos, and is missing here. Besides, with such an addition,
there's a got to be a joke about the 'little death' that could be
inserted somewhere.

Still, considering the inspiration, this is an excellent little game.
One can only hope that "You Get Transported To Another Dimension and
Find This Weird Machine In A Maze And Then Some Other Stuff Happens,
It's Really Cool" will be as good if Jacqueline H. decides to produce
it. (Though it's certain to be stupid.)

VERSION: 1.0 / 052202

I'm not sure what this game was meant to be. The story seems to be about
a carefree youngster, whose age is never precisely specified but which
we can infer must be in the late single digits or early teens, who's
sent away to an island prison for life due to an essentially trivial and
unintentional crime. The main story takes place three years into the
life sentence, and revolves around escaping the prison.

The opening of the story is somewhat jarring, in that before the player
character gets sent to prison for life, he's portrayed as an innocent
kid who's not even trying to get into trouble. We're not really trying
to do anything at all, for that matter; there's not any particular goal
at this point.

On my first couple of tries at the opening scene, I figured the prison
sentence must simply be an elaborate "death" scene. In other words, I
figured that the game was telling me the equivalent of "*** You have
died ***", which is the traditional message an IF game displays when the
player character is killed by an incorrect action. I got this impression
because the actions in question seem so random and trivial, and because
there are lots of them; in some games, such a variety of ways to "die"
would simply indicate boundaries of the game, with the deadly
consequences meant to guide players away from those boundaries and back
to the correct path. (It's not an especially subtle way of marking a
game's boundaries, and authors lately tend to favor other means, but
plenty of older games use this approach.) However, after a few tries, I
realized this must actually be the way forward in the story.

Once we're in the prison, there's nothing to do but set about escaping.
And here we encounter another jarring plot development: almost
immediately, we have to kill a guard in the course of our escape. The
player character's original crime is depicted as essentially accidental,
with no evil intent, but the murder of the guard is quite deliberate.
It's made clear that the player character is no psychopath -- he feels
bad after the fact that he had to kill the guard -- but this just means
he's become an utterly ruthless pragmatist who kills in cold blood when
it serves his goals.

So is "Concrete Paradise" a cautionary tale, a meditation on the
poisonous consequences of vindictive criminal justice, that turns an
innocent youth into a vicious killer in a few years' time?

Probably not. As the game progresses, it seems quite free of such
serious implications; this is simply a puzzle game that happens to have
some rather grim plot elements. If anything, the sensibility is
cartoonish, the grimness of the plot just a wild exaggeration for the
sake of an interesting story.

As a puzzle game, "Concrete Paradise" is serviceable, but suffers from a
few flaws. The most consistent is a certain fussiness about command
phrasing; in some places, an alternative syntax will reply with a
message about the command you should be using (which is annoying enough:
if the game can tell me "try this instead," it should almost always just
do that instead, instead), but in many others it simply didn't recognize
reasonably conventional phrasings for things that could be accomplished
with other phrasings. Which isn't quite as bad as the usual "guess the
verb" problem, where the only correct phrasing is unusual; rather, the
correct phrasing in these cases is perfectly ordinary, but other
equivalent ordinary phrasings aren't accepted.

Another deficiency in some of the puzzles is insufficient information to
motivate the solution. In one place, for example, I think you're
expected to simply try different directions randomly; in the location in
question, it's clear that you can't see where you're going, so this
isn't as bad as an unannounced exit in an otherwise ordinary location,
but you're given no reason to think the location would have any exits
other than the one you came in from. In other places, objects -- or
details of objects -- are found to be unusual only after close
inspection, even though they should be obvious at less detailed levels
of examination. For example, if there's something obviously unusual
about a wall, I shouldn't have to examine the wall to discover that,
because an obviously unusual feature of a major room component ought to
warrant mention in the room's top-level description.

Despite the occasional flaws in its puzzles, and the puzzling thematic
intentions, this game is fairly well written and playable. I didn't feel
greatly drawn in, mostly because of the unclear motivations of the main
character, I think; but most of the puzzles are logical and well
integrated into the story, and so are satisfying to solve.

VERSION: Release 1

If I had to describe this game in one word, I would pick "crazy." This
game, or series of mini-games, is wacky. Yes, it makes some sort of
weird sense, but you will probably only get a headache trying to figure
it all out. No, it is not confusing. The stories or sections in
themselves are easily understood. Trying to put all of them together and
figure out what the author's point is will drive you crazy, so just sit
back and enjoy the ride.

The fun of this game is not the puzzles or trying to figure out what to
do. For example, in "Falling" it is completely obvious what is
happening. You are falling and there is nothing you can do about it. The
enjoyment comes in trying every weird or wacky response you can think of
and watching what happens. I particularly liked "xyzzy." Ultimately, you
are forced to go along with the ride but it is short and amusing. After
you have finished, try "walkthrough" to see what I mean.

In another section, you get a completely opposite response to what you
expect. If you type "z," you get "Time does not pass." In fact, no
matter what you do, you cannot affect anything. Again, in terms of a
puzzle this is rather minimal and boring. The entertainment is in trying
everything. I can easily imagine this game becoming an IF classic in its
own right. I would definitely not recommend it for new IF players,
although it can show off what a really good parser can do. It goes
without saying that anything I could think of got a response and I think
I never got a default library message.

Unfortunately, there were two problems. One is an unnecessary use of
profanity. It added nothing and the game would have had just as much
charm without it. This is really too bad. The other problem was a very
small grammar error. Towards the end, it says "hint's" instead of
"hints." This is very small and would normally be overlooked, but for a
game which is otherwise so well written it stands out. The final problem
is an unnecessary maze. No, this is not a typical IF maze, but a Nethack
style maze. I wish I could have found a way to finish it because it
would be nice to see the closing text, if any. Oh well.

All three of the above brought the game down a point or two. If there
would have been a different constraint instead of the maze, this game
could rank a 10. It is not that I never give out scores that high, it is
just that most games are not worthy. I might give it another point
anyway, but I doubt it. This is just a suspicion, but I think Magnus
wrote this. It is not his traditional writing style, though.

My comp rating: 8

</a>
VERSION: Release 1

The Corn Identity is a unique experiment in collaborative interactive fiction.
Thirteen authors were each responsible for taking the previous author's source
code and, without having seen the whole story, constructing a new segment
before passing their code on to the next author. The concept is somewhat
similar to the party game "Whispers" or "Telephone," where a phrase is passed
from person to person with increasing loss of fidelity.

The release notes say "It should be obvious that this idea can't be effectively
applied to interactive fiction.  So of course we had to give it a try." But
what emerges is not the muddled mess one might expect: instead, the
conspirators have created a dreamlike pastiche of corpses, puzzles, a
distressingly ballooning inventory, and scenarios alternatingly disturbing and
goofy. It manages, surprisingly, to be entertaining.

Awakening groggy and trapped in a twenty foot steel cube, the player must
explore a sequence of connected areas and solve a variety of puzzles from
simple to middling-tricky, in order to unravel a mystery that seems to involve
corn, murder, shadowy powers-that-be, drugs, and a lot of colorful buttons. As
might be expected, the style of the game varies; in some parts you may die
without warning and need past-life experience to solve puzzles, while in others
you can't die at all and the puzzles are self-explanatory; some parts of the
game feature well-implemented areas while others are bare-bones and empty.
Interestingly, the tone of the story also varies, from deadly serious "X-Files"-
like mystery to goofy self-referential comedy to political satire and back
again.

What's perhaps not so expected is how smoothly the game transitions between all
these states. Any given moment feels self-consistent; it's only when you think
back to fifteen minutes ago that you realize you're essentially playing a
different game. Like a dream or a David Lynch movie, the game hustles you along
through self-contained situations that flows smoothly into each other, almost
succeeding in distracting you from the fact that the big picture is making less
and less sense all the time.

This is often annoying, as items tend to become useless as you move on to the
next segment, and plot threads are introduced and discarded so frequently that
the story slowly becomes a tangled mess. You never know when the game will
throw you a curve ball revealing that the new author has no idea what a certain
plot thread signifies, or rather, used to signify. The ending, in particular,
is unsatisfying, since it fails to tie up the myriad of loose ends that the
hapless final author could not even have known about.

But on another level, the experience is fascinating. Something taken for
granted in interactive fiction is that the game always knows more about its
story than you, and your goal is to figure out what commands will convince it
to give you more of its knowledge. Here, after the first few segments you
honestly know more about what's going on than the author did, and the game is
funniest when it acknowledges this shortcoming:

>>EXAMINE MAN

...  He resembles no one you know, either from your scientific life or your
family life (the two of which you take great care to keep separate).

In a context where the author knows nothing about the character's distant or
even immediate past, and indeed has no idea what the character is even meant to
be doing, this otherwise humdrum line had me grinning from ear to ear.

"The Corn Identity" is by no means a great game, and by many standards may not
even be a good one: it is often sparsely implemented, breaks no new ground in
terms of story, structure, or content, has a poorly-hinted puzzle or two and
enough dead-ends and red herrings for three games its size. For IF novices in
particular, it would be an off-putting introduction to the medium. But for
those familiar with the conventions of IF or the styles of the individual
authors, it's an amusing, sometimes clever, and always surreal adventure.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag21.html">SPAG #21</a> -- June 15, 2000

NAME: Corruption  
AUTHOR: Robert Steggles and Hugh Steers  
DATE: 1988 
PARSER: Magnetic Scrolls
SUPPORT: Magnetic
AVAILABILITY: Secondhand Retail/Auction (Out of Print)

VERSION: Version 1.12

Two schools of thought define adventure games. One school says, "an
adventure game is a story whose conflicts have been translated into
puzzles," while the second believes, "an adventure game is a puzzle
described in terms of a story." 

The difference is significant. 

If you look at "Corruption" through the eyes of the first school, you
will see a vastly unfair and agonizingly difficult work of interactive
fiction. The game cannot be finished, or even understood, without
experience gained through player-character "death." What's more, I can
predict, a little smugly, that everyone will discover, just before he
thinks he is about reach "Corruption's" climax, that he neglected to do
something at the start of the story, and must replay the entire game.
For instance, I found out that I should have thoroughly searched the
toilet sometime before the 15th move. 

If that sounds absurd, this may not be a game for you. Much of the
behavior required of the player character, like breaking into his
partner's office, would seem unmotivated -- even paranoid -- in any
other storytelling medium. 

On the other hand, members of the second school of thought will find a
mesmerizing, Chinese-puzzle-box of a game. "Corruption" is a giant
riddle, and to decipher its meaning, you must play, and replay, each of
its parts. Once the player has mapped out the movements of the
non-player characters, he will recognize a web of deceit and betrayal,
and be able guide his character to paths that lead to a satisfying
ending. 

In this way, "Corruption" is similar to Infocom's murder mysteries, but
"Corruption" is an English game, published by Magnetic Scrolls, and it
puts the same sort of twist on text-adventure mysteries that the English
director Alfred Hitchcock put on filmed mysteries. Instead of a
professional detective or reporter, the player character is a naive
everyman who becomes caught up in a criminal conspiracy. 

Unfortunately, conspiracies are difficult to uncover, and while a
reporter or detective has an assignment, the everyman in "Corruption"
has no immediate goal and will, most likely, wander around aimlessly
until the player figures out where and when to look for clues. 

Fortunately, Steers and Steggles' prose doesn't ramble. It efficiently
paints effective portraits of characters, events and locations, making
the illustrations redundant. I turned the graphics off when I played.
It's not that there was anything wrong with the illustrations, it's just
that characters like the brusque secretary, who really tries to be
friendly, and the indifferent lawyer, who, nevertheless, offers
comforting platitudes to the law's victims, are vivid and honest enough
to trigger mental images on their own. 

In short, "Corruption" is a well-written, bug-free puzzle fest, and the
puzzles are strongly related to an interesting suspense story. Remember
to save early and save often.

     In Cosmoserve, you play R.J. Wright, a plumber and freelance
computer programmer in 1999.  The program you are using to complete one
of your assignments has a glitch in it, and you must sign on to
Cosmoserve to download a patch file.  Along the way you will encounter
computer viruses, virtual reality games, lost passwords, online
conferences, FBI raids, online stalkers, and Rick's Cafe Americain.
     I think that Cosmoserve is my favourite non-commercial text game,
and certainly the all-time best AGT game.  Judith Pintar performs
wonders with the AGT parser.  You can actually navigate through the
hard drive of your 786 computer using DOS commands.  When you logon,
you are treated to phone dialing and modem sounds.  When you are in an
online conference the other users' statements come one at a time, as in
real life.  Maxis could market this game as &quot;SIM BBS&quot;.
     The plot is delightfully interwoven, as the simple task of finding
your patch file takes you on a trip through a myriad of forums, file
directories, conferences and e-mail encounters.
     There is limited online help in three places.  There is a hints
forum (GO HINTS) that will answer a few questions.  Also, Ms. Pintar
herself makes a cameo appearance in the Virtual Reality game as Judith,
the Cosmoserve Hints Sysop.  Thirdly, your Aunt Edna will drop by early
in the game if you are unable to find your new password.
     The atmosphere is superb.  Watching the debate in the Plumbers &
Electricians forum over which profession provides a better metaphor for
the human condition (one purifies with water, the other with fire) is
frighteningly funny.  Tongue-in-cheek games about real life are
invariably compared to Infocom's <A HREF="b.html#bureau">Bureaucracy</A>, and they usually fall far
short.  This one doesn't.
     This is probably not a game that can be completed in one pass.  You
are on a time limit of less than 12 hours, and some things can only be
done at certain times.  It is likely that you will have to restart the
game from the beginning at some point to optimize your time
utilization.
      A couple of points.  Although Cosmoserve is available for all AGT
ports, MS-DOS users will have a slight advantage, as the game is keyed
to simulate a PC.  Also, people who have logged on using generic
communications software will be better prepared for the game, as there
is no &quot;Cosmoserve Information Manager&quot;.
     Incredibly this game only tied for first in the AGT Game Writing
Contest.

        &quot;CosmoServe: An Adventure Game for the BBS-Enslaved&quot;  has a
&quot;play-within-a-play feel.&quot;  You are an absent-minded, self-employed computer
consultant/programmer and erstwhile plumber who is trying to beat a project
deadline.  Solutions to the bugs in your creation may be found on CosmoServe,
but--alas--you have forgotten your password, and, what's more, you've got a

escalate from there to a fairly engrossing set of subplots and
games-within-games.  Much of the game is set in a simulated computer/bbs
environment, and therein lies its appeal.  The novel atmosphere more than
makes up for the flat characterization.  The puzzles are clever and logically
solved, and the plot is tightly written, with only 86 locations.
Give this one a try.  Hats off to the author, Judith Pintar, who doesn't ask

VERSION: Release 3

The growing trend away from puzzle-based IF toward--well, toward
non-puzzle-based IF, which has taken a variety of forms--has meant that
an author's ability to convey a scene has become more important. IF fans
have always put a premium on good writing, of course, but in the era of
puzzle IF the point was generally to set the scene and get out of the
way; the writing in many canonical IF games--<a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork I</a> and <a href = "p.html#planet">Planetfall</a>, for
instance--was distinctly on the terse side. Now, when simulation is more
prized, writing that does more than convey the basic relevant
information is needed, and Kathleen Fischer's The Cove, an example of IF
whose setting is the raison d'etre rather than an excuse for some
puzzles, nicely illustrates the importance of effective writing.

The Cove won Best Landscape in Marnie Parker's Art Show in the spring of
2000, and the landscape really does take center stage: there are only a
few locations, but all of them are packed with things to experience. In
fact, your score increases not with problems solved, but with things
seen (or heard, or smelled, or felt), though exactly which ones give you
a point and which don't feels rather arbitrary. Interestingly, much of
the interaction is purely sensory--there aren't many objects to
manipulate, and you can't really affect your surroundings much, though
you can certainly be affected by them. The scene itself--a seaside
cliff, a beach, a cave--is familiar, but there are enough unexpected
elements--a sea lion, an otter, tidal pools--to make it feel fresh, and
the game oozes attention to detail. An example:

   Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge
   of the surf at a quarter of the way up the beach. Additional clumps,
   dried and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of
   the cliffs -- a warning of the sea's intentions.

   >examine clumps
   Ripped from their holdfasts during heavy seas, the long strands of
   seaweed are pushed along by wind and tides until they are at last
   flung up upon the shore. There they form tangled mophead heaps, a
   haven for the small flies, crabs, and the like who feed upon the
   decaying fronds.

Seaweed you might expect in a beach scene, but not every game would
think to point out what sorts of things eat the seaweed. (Okay, flies
don't really eat the seaweed as such, but that's a minor detail.)
Likewise, the note that the placement of the seaweed indicates the
high-water mark is an effective detail, even if the "warning" is a touch
more obvious than it needs to be. Again, it's not the sort of thing that
rewards extensive poking and prodding--there's nothing you can actually
do with the seaweed. The point is to appreciate the details and recreate
the scene in your imagination, and the game does a good job of giving
your imagination plenty to work with.

The writing, likewise, is quite good. There are some misspellings and
mechanical errors that prove a little distracting--arguably more so than
in your average game, because the descriptions aren't here to be
skimmed, as they sometimes are. But there are also lots of effective and
well-placed images--the "tangled mophead heaps" of seaweed above are one
example, as is this: "A long legged plover chases after the waves,
pecking at the sand as it goes." The scene is littered with small but
vivid details--the cliffs are described as "fractured granite," for
instance--and the author takes care to use verbs rather than adjectives
whenever possible, usually a sign of better-than-average writing.
(Example: "The leading edge of the storm clouds reaches the cove,
blotting out the sun.") The verbs are often passive, muting their
effectiveness somewhat, but it's a minor sin.

Unfortunately, the landscape isn't the only thing here; there's a plot
of sorts involving a dead lover and a pressured marriage and such that
owes much to clich&#233; and adds very little to the game. One of the verbs
that you're encouraged to use is REMEMBER, which tells you the emotional
significance of this location or that sensation in rather, well,
heavy-handed ways. It's not a great choice, on the whole, simply because
it's not easy to identify with someone else and take on her memories
when you've only been in that character's shoes for a few minutes--and
the game is short enough that you can't really put in any more time than
that. It's not impossible, of course, that the landscape element of the
game would be enriched by a story that goes with it, but the nature of
this particular story, and the clich&#233;s underlying it, make it difficult
for it to work as planned. Part of the problem is that the author's
skills appear to lie more in sensory description than in conveying your
emotions--at least, the former is more effective; perhaps, had the
author given us an actual flashback that would permit us to experience
the relevant past events for ourselves, we would feel them a little more
keenly. As it is, when the focus turns from the present to the past, the
player tends to feel a bit shut out. It's for this reason that the
ending of The Cove--which has more to do with the plot than with the
landscape-isn't quite as involving as what's come before. It says
something about the current state of IF, I suppose, that the author felt
compelled to add the plot elements rather than merely providing a
landscape to explore-there's not really much precedent for IF that's
both plotless and puzzleless. But there's no inherent reason, to my
mind, why such a thing can't work.

At any rate, The Cove does demonstrate the potential of "art show"
IF--the landscape aspect makes for an absorbing IF experience, well
worth the download. That the story doesn't add much illustrates, in a
backhanded way, the potential of the form.

     (Note: this is the no-sound, no-pictures version of the game)
VERSION: Release 1.0.04

I enjoyed Robb Sherwin's A Crimson Spring quite a bit. It is well-paced
and enjoyable to read and play. It sucked me in like a good book or a
good movie, something I often find myself wishing for in a text
adventure game but rarely find. Paradoxically, one vehicle for achieving
this end in A Crimson Spring is what is frequently derided in
contemporary discussions of good interactive fiction: the game is very
much "on rails". 

For instance, about half of the game is driven by conversation that
moves in one primary direction. Conversation progress is accomplished
through a TALK TO system, in which the player chooses the number of the
conversation-opener the player character (PC) wishes to use. The PC can
keep on talking until there are no more openers left. I personally have
no problem with this system, because the responses are intriguing and
entertaining. They propel the story. I do not feel as if I am reading a
dry transcription of a chain of events, but rather that I am
participating in those events. I think this is primarily due to the
quality and pacing of the writing.

By "pacing of the writing", I am referring to the interplay between plot
or exposition and player action. In some games, the player is required
to discover what the plot is, and this as much as anything is the
central conflict and motivating factor for the PC, at least in the
beginning. Not so with A Crimson Spring. From the beginning, we are
presented with a fleshed-out protagonist with a problem and a goal. This
was a boon to me because I do not enjoy wandering around randomly
examining things and trying to logically discern what goes with what.
Instead, in this game the player is much more limited in terms of where
the PC can go or what the PC can do, but it doesn't *feel* limiting,
because at any one point in the game there are usually only a few
choices that would make any sense for the protagonist to make.

At points where there is really only one choice that the PC would make,
the choice becomes automated. For example, at one point in the game the
PC intends to visit a non-player character's (NPC's) home. At that
point, the player doesn't need to manually move the protagonist to the
NPC's house by typing in directional commands -- once the player moves
the protagonist out of his house, the game takes the protagonist to the
other person's house. 

This is where the quality of the writing comes in: at junctures where
events occur outside the player's jurisdiction. Without good writing at
those junctures, the player gets bored. The player won't be interested
in the PC or his damn problems. Fortunately, Robb Sherwin is a good
writer, and I found myself intrigued rather than bored by his
descriptions of events occurring outside my control.

Despite the fact that the story moves primarily in one direction, the
game feels like it is in the player's control. There is more than one
ending to the game, and much of the conversation is supplemental, rather
than essential, to the story itself, so there is room for
experimentation. The author does a good job of treading the line between
dictating the story and letting the player find it.

That said, there are a few minor qualms that I have about the game.
There are some continuity problems, such as that, after a certain point,
a certain minor NPC will say the same thing to you each time you meet
him, or that an NPC inexplicably knows how to contact you even though
only one other character in the game besides yourself knows where you
are, and those two NPCs probably have not spoken to each other. This
problem shades over into a realism problem. The game is set in a gritty
superhero world (I can hear people grumbling, wondering why I am
concerned with realism). I gladly accept the poetic conceit of
superheroes existing in a modern-day world, but when a major villain and
the superheroes get together to duke it out and there are no bystanders,
no police, and no discernable threat made by the villain to the populace
at large, I find it difficult to swallow. Nonetheless, the
aforementioned battle is an exciting and well-written part of the game.

I cannot stress enough that the storyline and the writing in this game
are both very good. There is a sense of drama evoked by the events in
the game that I find lacking in many games which are more open-ended in
terms of what the player can do and in what order. The "on rails"
quality of A Crimson Spring works because it is not difficult to move
forward in the plot, on the one hand, and the plot itself is
well-written and intriguing, on the other. The puzzles are not difficult
at all, and primarily consist of getting information (by talking to
people) so that the PC will know what to do next. I enjoy the easy
puzzles because it returns the player's attention to the story at hand.

As I said earlier, the game pulled me in. It has a well-paced and
interesting story, and that is its shining glory.

    Crypt is a small gothic horror story about an adventurer
discovering the mysteries of the old church and its old history. I can
only add that I liked the story, but found it a bit straightforward and
predictable. The main flaw of the game is a poor vocabulary and
the existence of traps one cannot get out of (for example, if you fall
into a grave without a ladder). Characters are 'part of the interior' and
behave like special places rather than intelligent beings.  Nonetheless, the
story is impressive and the whole game is worth registering.
    Alas, I have been unable to finish the game yet. Hope to do that after
registering.

NAME: The Curse of Eldor

VERSION: Version 1.0

A for-the-most-part nice old-style adventure game with the vastness
and anachronistic amalgamation of magic and technology.  The atmosphere
is very <A HREF="z.html#zork1">Zork</A>ish, as are the puzzles.  There's a balloon, a dragon, a
retired grue, a magic potion, an eating cycle (not a problem once you
find out where the food is), some guesswork puzzles, one suicide puzzle
(Is it my imagination, or is there a lot of suicide among this year's
entries - &quot;Eldor,&quot; &quot;<A HREF="i.html#end">In The End</A>,&quot; &quot;<A HREF="r.html#rippled">Rippled Flesh</A>,&quot; &quot;<A HREF="d.html#delusions">Delusions</A>&quot;?), some
clever bits, a dash of guess-the-verb, and an overall quest for curse-
breaking artifacts that in the end really amounts to a simplified
treasure hunt.  A fine example of this type of adventure, though it
offers nothing we haven't seen before.

The game engine, however, could use some work.  Ambiguous verb
resolution (that is, the ability to fill in the missing command
information) doesn't work at all, there's no &quot;UNDO,&quot; no &quot;AGAIN,&quot; no
command recall, not even &quot;VERBOSE&quot; (for me, the most annoying of all).
&quot;Eldor&quot; has some rather glaring bugs as well.  Trying to take the
amulet from the dragon is a fatal move, but restarting completes the
command successfully, eliminating a large string of puzzles.  &quot;SAVE&quot;
and "RESTORE" also gave me some problems, placing me in a room with
all the takeable objects only to kill me off one turn later.  This
made me reluctant to play through on my own, and eventually I resorted
to the walkthrough.

A major detriment is the fact that, even ignoring the &quot;RESTORE&quot; flaws,
the game is still thoroughly impossible without the walkthrough, unless
you're a darn good guesser.  Four or five locations contain items or
characters that aren't even mentioned!  In the very first room, for
instance, a historian is waiting with a note for you, but there's no
indication whatsoever of his presence!  This, along with the crystal in
the locked chest, the thief in the dungeon, the goblin in the sewers
below town, all make the game a pain to finish, especially since one has
to restart the game (because of the &quot;RESTORE&quot; bug) each time the
walkthrough is consulted.

  NAME: Curses                            PARSER: Similar to Infocom
  AUTHOR: Graham Nelson                   EMAIL: graham SP@G gnelson.demon.co.uk
  ATMOSPHERE: Excellent, Well-Researched  AVAILABILITY: Freeware_IF Archive
  WRITING: Literate, Educated, Amusing    PLOT: Excellent
  PUZZLES: Logical (mostly)               SUPPORTS: Infocom Ports
  CHARACTERS: Often Quite Funny           DIFFICULTY: Rather (7 out of 10)

This is the finest work of IF which I have played since <A HREF="t.html#trinity">Trinity</A>, bar none. 

Curses is perhaps the most &quot;literate&quot; work of IF to come along in years.  I
really cannot say enough good things about this game, so you have no choice
but to go out right now and get a copy for yourself.  You can't really make
any excuses about it, either, since Curses is completely free and is
written using the old Infocom story file format, which means that it's
playable on just about any computer in existence with one of the existing
Infocom interpreter programs (I recommend Mark Howell's Zip but
InfoTaskForce's will also work, as will any of several others).

You are an aristocrat who is preparing to go on vacation in Paris.  All you
want to do is find one lousy tourist map which you KNOW is in the attic
somewhere, and then you're off.  Sounds easy, right?  Right...

I can't even begin to describe this game without spoiling the plot, so I'll
simply ask:  How would you react when a seemingly simple situation in your
attic transformed into ancient magic, past and present places and times, a
mental tour of your own history, a &quot;chance&quot; to control the fundamental basis
upon which the universe is founded, the discovery of ancient powers
utilized by Merlin himself, Heaven, Hell, robot mice, and of course curses?

I don't know about you, but I reacted by becoming glued to my terminal for
about 50 hours straight.  Graham Nelson, the author of Curses, deserves the
highest kudos for his accomplishment.  I can't wait to see what he's going
to do next -- if you are going to play one IF game this year, make it
Curses.  Be warned that some of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult, and
one or two are a bit non-intuitive, but there are legions of loyal Curses
fans just dying for the chance to help you out anyway just so they will
have someone else to talk to about this wonderful game.  Go get it NOW.


From: Nick Patavalis &lt;npat SP@G kmp.forthnet.gr&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag22.html">SPAG #22</a> -- September 15, 2000

A couple of days ago I solved Graham Nelson's Curses. Before this, my
recent Interactive Fiction experiences were with small and mostly
"experimental" games like <a href = "f.html#for">For a Change</a>, <a href = "s.html#shrapnel">Shrapnel</a>, <a href = "h.html#hunter">Hunter, in
Darkness</a>, <a href = "n.html#905">9:05</a>, etc. I was worried that next to these games Curses
would seem somewhat archaic and dusty or even superficial. (Something
like jumping directly from reading Joyce to reading Homer)

Early in the game my worries seemed to materialize: I am asked to play
the role of an English gentleman (an aristocrat, as will shortly become
evident) looking for a map in my mansion's attics. Not a special map,
not a secret map, not a treasure map; just an ordinary tourist map of
Paris. Why am I, the player/character hybrid, then going through all
this trouble? Aren't there any traveler's bookstores open nearby? It's a
Thursday in June 1993 after all! OK, exploring the attics, browsing
through all these forgotten objects of the past brings back memories,
but does this justify plotting against my aunt Jemima just to steal her
gardening gloves? Where is my sense of proportion? Why am I putting
myself in danger going up and down the cellars in rusty old elevators?
Why is it so big a problem to find a fresh battery? Why, after all, am I
playing this game?

But I did keep playing the game.

And before I realized it I was seriously hooked: I started drawing maps,
taking detailed notes, reading carefully, line by line, word by word,
the biographies of the members of the Meldrew family. I even restarted
the game several times, not because I got stuck in a puzzle, but because
I wanted to reread the text to make sure that there was no detail I had
missed the first times through. Slowly and masterfully, Nelson starts
unwinding a strange story, taking you back and forth in time and
speaking about supernatural phenomena, about magic, about ancient
curses, about greek mythology and decay. It does so in such a beautiful
way, always keeping the game open and making the player the center of
the game-world, so that it is the player who writes the story; it is he
who synchronizes the unbelievable chain of events. The writer has
created a beautiful universe, has defined its rules, has filled it with
treasures and miracles and invited you to come and explore it. He
doesn't drag you by the nose with a linear plot. He doesn't even confine
you in the bodycast of a strongly characterized alter-ego. This is not a
novel. This is not a movie, nor a painting: it is an Adventure Game!
Nelson shows this clearly from the very first moment by making the early
puzzles so obviously distanced from the story: There's no doubt about
it, you've turned on your computer to play and Adventure Game. Either
enjoy it or switch it off and do something else.

As the game evolves, the puzzles get more and more woven into the story,
up to the point where they actually become part of it. Solving the
puzzle becomes part of the plot. Overcoming the obstacle carefully
planted by the ingenious author becomes integral part of the
exploration. It is one of the few games where the puzzles and riddles
actually enhance the atmosphere and enrich the dramatic content of the
narative than threaten it. Even the hint-system is nicely embedded in
the game-world. Ocasionally, though, one will find the author devilishly
smiling between the lines as he playfully puts the most impossible
object (like, for instance, a beach-ball) in the most improbable place!

There are some difficult puzzles here, puzzles that will trouble even
the most experienced adventurer. Almost all of them, though, are logical
and staged in such a way that the player will receive enough hinting.
Curses is not a game to be solved in a couple of hours. It is a game to
be enjoyed for weeks. It is a game to create obsessions. If you are of
the type of player that has a walkthrough by your side as you play, then
perhaps Curses is not for you. Running through the scenes of the story,
instead of slowly and carefully exploring, will I fear ruin the effect.
In this game you must stumble, you must retreat, you must visit every
place several times, read the text carefully, read it again, look for
hints everywhere, become suspicious. This intricate little world is for
the explorer, not the tourist!

To cut a long story... long, the more I played the game the more I
enjoyed it. It had "become a matter of pride now not to give up", to
solve it without resorting to hints or walkthroughs. It wouldn't be
untrue to say that the month I spent with Curses included maybe the most
exciting adventuring moments I had since I first played <a href = "z.html#zork1">Zork</a> back in
1988.

Curses is a classic, and it must be treated as such. Nelson has studied
the great Interactive Fiction tradition from as far back as <a href = "a.html#advent">ADVENT</a> and
collected the elements that define the medium. He then blended and used
them in a skillful way to create a masterpiece. Curses is not
experimental. Curses is conclusional. It does not try to explore the
vague borders of the medium; it stays well behind the trenches, ploughs
the rich soil and collects the harvest that feeds the experimentalists'
armies. Experimentation without games like Curses is sterile. If works
like Shrapnel and <a href = "s.html#sofar">So Far</a> expand Interactive Fiction (and they do),
then games like Curses prove it.

I would like to close this review using a quote that appears on the
first page of Nelson's essay on if-authoring:

   Skill without imagination is craftsmanship and gives us many useful
   objects such as wickerwork picnic baskets. Imagination without skill
   gives us modern art.
         -- Tom Stoppard, Artist Descending A Staircase

If there is something you cannot blame Nelson about, it is lack of
skill. If there is something you cannot blame Curses about, it is lack
of importance. The rest is ALSO a matter of personal taste!
