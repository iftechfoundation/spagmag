<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Version 3.0 -- April 14, 2008</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Maintained by Jimmy Maher (<a href="mailto:maher@filfre.net">maher@filfre.net</a>)</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is SPAG?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> is an informative e-zine
devoted to textual interactive fiction and other types of interactive
narrative. &nbsp;It includes reviews, interviews, and feature articles.
&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> is published on a roughly quarterly basis.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> was founded by G. Kevin&nbsp;Wilson, and is currently edited by Jimmy Maher.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What about graphic adventures? </span><br>
<br>
SPAG has traditionally focused on games whose primary medium is
text.&nbsp; There is, however, a wider universe of interactive
storytelling, and <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> likes
to (to thoroughly mix my metaphors) dive into these waters as well from
time to time. &nbsp;If you are interested in writing a review of a
graphical game or a feature article on some aspect of interactive
narrative that is not traditional IF, feel free to contact the editor
to see if your proposal will be a good fit for <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>.&nbsp; The main thing to remember is that <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>
is not about kill counts, frames per second, or any of the other
traditional videogame metrics. &nbsp;We are rather all about this brave
new medium of storytelling on the computer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What does <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> stand for?</span><br>
<br>
As you may have guessed, <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>
is an acronym. It means "The Society for the Promotion of Adventure
Games". Originally, the 'P' was for "Preservation". However, in early
1997 a growing consensus that interactive fiction wasn't in immediate
danger of extinction any more led to a name change. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cool. How do I join?</span><br>
<br>
Well, actually you don't. There is no formal Society, just a loose association of the contributors and readers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> ezine. In a sense, you join <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> by reading it and/or writing for it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>'s format?</span><br>
<br>
Each issue will begin with an editorial and a news section reporting
new games and recent developments in the IF community. &nbsp;After that
will come feature articles, interviews, and reviews, in whatever order
seems most suitable.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Didn't there used to be a scoreboard or something?</span><br>
<br>
For its first eight years, <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> featured a scoreboard, a chart listing the scores that <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> readers gave to various IF games. The scoreboard was discontinued as of issue #29 (June 20th, 2002).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I submit an article or review to <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> welcomes articles on
virtually all aspects of textual interactive fiction history, theory,
craft, and culture. &nbsp;It is very likely that <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>
will also be interested in articles and reviews covering other areas of
interactive narrative outside the boundaries of traditional textual IF,
subject to the guidelines given earlier in this FAQ. &nbsp;To save
yourself some frustration, however, it is&nbsp;best to contact <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>'s
editor to enquire whether your proposed article would be a good fit for
the magazine before going through the trouble of actually writing it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> also welcomes reviews of
textual interactive fiction games, interesting examples of other forms
of interactive narrative, and even books that relate to interactive
storytelling.&nbsp; The easiest way to submit a review is to use the
form available from the <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>
home page.&nbsp; Fill it out as completely as you can, but do not
stress over fields you are unsure about.&nbsp; After submitting this
form, you should receive a CCed copy of your submission in your email
immediately.&nbsp; You should then expect a personal acknowledgement
from the editor within a few days at the most.&nbsp; If you do not
receive either or both of these confirmations, something may have gone
wrong.&nbsp; By all means, email the editor to inquire.<br>
<br>
Articles, reviews, letters and ratings may be sent by conventional email to <a href="mailto:maher@filfre.net">Jimmy Maher</a>. &nbsp;Just about any common modern document format is fine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is expected from a <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> review?</span><br>
<br>
A <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> review should be an
intelligent discussion of a piece of interactive fiction, and it should
be written in reasonably polished prose. Within those guidelines, all
publishable reviews will be accepted as long as they deal with a game
that can reasonably be considered&nbsp;textual interactive fiction or
that is a noteworthy effort in some other form of interactive
narrative. If in doubt whether your subject is appropriate for <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>,
by all means enquire before writing the review. &nbsp;Reviews of games
that have already been reviewed three or more times in SPAG will only
be accepted if they make a significant original contribution to the
discussion of those games. Authors may not review their own games.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> employs a "no-spoiler" policy for reviews, with the exception of reviews intended for <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG </span>Specifics (see below). This policy has been stretched a bit in the past, but now that <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> Specifics exists, the no-spoiler policy will be enforced rather more strictly.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How does a <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> Specifics review differ from a normal <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG </span>review?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> Specifics is a small section that appears in some issues of SPAG. &nbsp;A <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>
Specifics review is more of an in-depth critical reading and analysis
of a work of interactive fiction than a conventional review. &nbsp;As
such, there are no restrictions on spoilers, in recognition that
avoidance of spoilers can sometimes hinder the detailed examination of
a piece of interactive fiction.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What will I get for contributing to SPAG?</span><br>
<br>
SPAG does not pay anything monetarily for contributions. &nbsp;You
will, however, receive the satisfaction of giving something back to the
IF community. &nbsp;For those who perhaps lack the time or ambition to
give games or tools to the community but nevertheless enjoy playing IF,
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> provides a wonderful way
to contribute in the form of reviews or articles. &nbsp;Artists crave
feedback on their work, making reviewers almost as important to the
community's health as the authors themselves.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I submit work to <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> that I have already published elsewhere?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG </span>may on rare occasions republish a review or article from another source, but original work is vastly preferred.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I republish a review or article I wrote for <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>?</span><br>
<br>
Authors are returned the rights to their work following its first appearance in <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>. &nbsp;This means you are free to publish your work elsewhere <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> its premiere in <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>. &nbsp;Note, however, that in submitting your work to <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> you also grant it the right to host the work on its website in perpetuity.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Must I have completed a game to review it for <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span>?</span><br>
<br>
In general, yes.&nbsp; You would probably not be impressed by a
published movie review from someone who had wandered into the theatre
halfway through, or by a book review from someone who had lost interest
and quit reading before reaching the end.&nbsp; An interactive fiction
review is really no different.&nbsp; To give a game a fair shake, the
reviewer must have seen it through to the end.<br>
<br>
The only exceptions apply to more experimental pieces which perhaps
have no traditional ending, or to games which are so bug-ridden as to
be uncompletable.&nbsp; (Whether the latter is even worth your effort
as a reviewer when there are so many serious efforts worthy of your
attention is of course very much an open question.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How is <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG </span>distributed?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Each issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> is published on the <span style="font-style: italic;">SPAG</span> website at http://www.sparkynet.com/spag. &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

readers that a new issue is available, for requesting article and
review submissions, and for any other necessary communications.
