VERSION: Release 1

Labyrinth consists of a series of puzzles set in a maze of sorts. Not a "twisty 
little passages" maze where the directions are non-reversible and the rooms are 
indistinguishable. No, this maze is logical enough; the main difficulty is 
figuring out how to get from room to room, and I think I would really have 
enjoyed it if it hadn't been for a small problem.

That problem was the room descriptions: they completely confused me! Each wall 
in a room is of a different colour, as well as the floor and ceiling, and there 
are several doorways from each room, usually in strange positions like upside 
down against the ceiling. These doorways were my main problem; they are 
described as "archways," and when I first read about "an archway halfway up the 
south wall, extending from its western edge toward the middle of the wall," I 
imagined a stone arch sticking out into the room. The archway is really a 
doorway through the wall, with its base against the west wall instead of against 
the floor, but I didn't figure this out until I was quite a ways through the 
game using the walkthrough, and by that point I had already spoiled the rest of 
the puzzle.

The other puzzles were mostly things like Nim or a cipher that would work just 
as well on paper. I didn't like the inclusion of the cipher. Ciphers essentially 
say to me, "pause the game while you go figure out this puzzle, and come back 
here when you're finished." And it was a keyword cipher, which I have no idea 
how to solve, so I never would have made it past this puzzle on my own. On the 
other hand, I did enjoy the "magic number" puzzle. It's another "go solve this 
and come back" puzzle, but the difference is that I enjoyed going and solving 
it. I probably wouldn't include it in an adventure game, because someone who 
didn't like that sort of thing would be just as irritated by it as I was by the 
cipher, but I still had fun with it.

In the end, a game like Labyrinth stands or falls on its puzzles. Labyrinth's 
"maze" is creative and with a bit more clarity would make an excellent setting 
for a collection of unique and interesting puzzles. Unfortunately, most of 
Labyrinth's puzzles don't fit that description. There are a couple of 
exceptions, but they aren't enough to make the game worthwhile.

A word of warning.  This game has a problem when played with the Zoom based 
interpreters (including Gargoyle and Spatterlight).  Play with Frotz.  As far as 
I know, Preuninger is working on a new version that presumably won't have these 
problems.

Another word of warning: this game is almost pure puzzle.  Right from the very 
first description: "A Sweet-Smelling Room: The room is a perfect cube, about 30 
feet on a side.  The ceiling is yellow and the floor is purple.  The north wall 
is blue, and the eastern wall is green.  To the south, the wall is orange, and 
the western wall is red.  The walls are bare of ornament, and no furniture 
occupies the room." we can tell that we are entering into a world where certain 
things, like the colour of the walls, are going to important.  The fact that the 
floor and ceiling are described probably hints at the importance of the third 
dimension.  Our suspicions are immediately reinforced by the following 
paragraphs that describe in meticulous detail the doors in the room.  Most of 
which are not in their usual orientations and are situated in inaccessible 
portions of the walls and ceiling.  It all adds up to a strong reference to 
Escher and The Cube (the entertainingly low-budget movie).

The game consists of a sequence of puzzles embedded into the framework of a text 
adventure.  Some would say that many of the puzzles would do better without the 
wrapper.  I'm not sure, I think what wrapper there is adds character to the 
game.  You're not merely pulling levers and pressing buttons in some abstract 
puzzle, you play the part of a trying-to-be-cool maths professor (we can tell 
because X ME reveals that the PC is into rock climbing and air guitar).  Each 
room has a distinctive smell, this is very handy for orienting yourself, but 
these are not mere scent markers on your map, they too add character: "The room 
smells rather strongly of wet dog.  You reaffirm your decision never to acquire 
a pet.".

The help text says "I'll just say that drawing a map would be helpful".  Well, 
that _is_ true, and you definitely should draw a map.  I drew three.  It's one 
of those games where you realise, perhaps with horror, perhaps with glee, that 
your map drawing efforts are documenting completely the wrong thing and you'd be 
better of starting over with a different sort of map.  In actual fact the game 
isn't all that big, and the map isn't that complex, but much of game, the 
central puzzle as it were, is figuring out exactly what is going on.  This 
puzzle involves transforming the geography in quite a cool way (let's just say 
that NORTH doesn't always mean the same thing), and you'll probably have needed 
to paid attention in your algebra class to fully understand it.

The puzzles are hard; as well as the main geometry puzzle there are the usual 
object composition puzzles and riddles, and the rather less traditional, at 
least in text adventures, game of nim and a cipher (actually I wouldn't be 
surprised if nim and ciphers cropped up in some very old school games, but 
they're not common now).  There's even an last lousy point puzzle (which I 
haven't got). Preuninger includes hints and a walkthrough (as separate HTML 
files); you may be able to finish using them, but they won't necessarily 
enlighten you.

There are those who would say that the game is too puzzle-heavy, it lacks 
story (it doesn't actually, but the story _is_ more of a cliched veneer than 
anything else), the descriptions are too mechanical.  They miss the point.  
Labyrinth stands out like a lightning-rod for gaming, it deliberately and 
directly opposes the modern style of story led interactive fiction.  What it 
lacks in quality and finesse it more than makes up for in reviving freshness.  
In addition I suspect that the game has a little bit more heart in it than most 
of its detractors realise.  In how many games can you voluntarily FART ?  No, I 
don't really want an answer to that question.

With my tongue in my cheek I would say that I found this game a refreshing 
change from all the diplomat-on-an-alien-planet and mutant-spider games in this 
year's comp.

NAME: The Lady in Green
AUTHOR: D.F. Stone
EMAIL: ?
DATE: ?
PARSER: AGT standard
SUPPORTS: AGT ports
AVAILABILITY: ftp.ifarchive.org
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/agt/lady.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/agt/lady.zip</a>

The Lady in Green is another from the <a href = "e.html#electra">Electrabot</a>/<a href = "d.html#detect">Detective</a> school of
gaming, although it has more in the way of puzzles and story than
either of those two.  Like them, gameplay consists primarily of
following a more or less straightforward path through the game area
until you reach the end, at which point you win.  Detective had no
puzzles along the way and Electrabot only required you to match random
weapons with the monsters that they killed.  The Lady in Green goes
beyond this with some genuine puzzles, but they are still very easy
and buggy.  A couple even solve themselves (literally).

The story begins with you as a tired, bored businessman, returning
home from a trip to your wife, kids, and unmowed lawn.  At your hotel,
you are captivated by a mysterious portrait of a sad-looking woman in
a green dress that seems to be reaching out towards you.  In true
Twilight Zone fashion, you end up traveling through the portrait 200
years into the past into the (empty) bedroom of the lady in green.

At this point, it appeared that the story would be either a
time-travelling love-at-first-sight story, or some kind of
reincarnation affair.  It turns out to be neither.  When you find the
Lady in Green, it turns out that she just wants you to find her
13-year old son who didn't return home last night.  You search for
him, and find that he has been press-ganged into the British Navy as a
galley slave (!).  You must rescue him and return him home.

The game is divided into several sections.  A minor puzzle is usually
required to get from one section to the next, and it is impossible to
return to an earlier section until the end of the game.  It is
possible to get the game into an unwinnable state if you fail to
obtain a necessary item in one section before leaving it.  The game is
so short and easy though that this is not a major inconvenience.
Furthermore, the game comes with both an ASCII walkthrough file and
the AGT source code, so the chances of getting stuck are zero.

The puzzles are extremely easy, and as I said, there are some that
solve themselves.  In two instances, I merely entered the appropriate
area while carrying the necessary item, and was automatically told
that I had done the right thing with it.

The game is still rather buggy.  For example, the horse is needed
twice during the game, however you are only allowed to ride it in two
certain areas.  Elsewhere you are simply told that you can't ride it
at all.  Unfortunately, the horse CAN be picked up and carried around (!).
Since the horse is a part of the room description in the stables,
you can still see it there when it really isn't.  Of course, this
could be fixed by changing one line in the source code.  You can also
be blocked from entering an area by a dog that really isn't there when
you examine it.  At one point there is a barrel that cannot be taken
by saying TAKE BARREL.  You need to solve a puzzle to get it.  Or you
could just say TAKE ALL, which will take everything including the
barrel, obviating the puzzle.

The characters are cyberphantoms; you're never sure whether they're
really there or not, and not only the dog and the horse.  When you are
returning with the Lady in Green's son, you get the same descriptions
you got on the way out.  There is no creature (AGT's programming term
for all entities other than yourself) accompanying you.  You once or
twice get a message that indicates that he is with you, but usually
have no indication of it at all, and can neither see nor interact with
him.  The Lady in Green is similarly spectral (which may be
appropriate).  One turn after you enter the room with her, she gives
you your mission and leaves with no chance for interaction (Know what
I mean?  Say no more.  Nudge, nudge.)  The game is over the next time
you find her again.

One interesting thing about the game is the ending, which gives you
the option of staying in the past with the Lady in Green, or returning
to your old life.  Providing genuinely different endings is a rarely
seen touch (<a href = "p.html#plunder">Plundered Hearts</a> being the only other example I can think
of).  However, in Plundered Hearts, one of the endings is described as
being clearly superior to the others, where here, you are told that
they are both valid, even though if you choose to stay, you are
abandoning your wife and children in the present simply to run off and
live in what the game calls a more exciting time.  It's plain to see
that D.F. Stone isn't female if he calls this a valid choice.  I would
have liked it much better if your character had been a bachelor
returning home to a life of dirty laundry and ravioli eaten straight
out of the can, who had no real ties to the present.

This game won an honourable mention in the 6th AGT Game Writing
Contest.

{ As far as I know, _all_ entrants in the AGT Game Writing Contest
  (that didn't win prizes) got honourable mentions. -- MO }

VERSION: Version 1.0

Here's an interesting twist on fantasy games.  Rather than making you,
the protagonist, a denizen of a fantasy world, &quot;Fence&quot; casts you as an
outsider from the &quot;real&quot; world, and sends you into the fantasy to
accomplish a goal and escape.  To me, this lends more appeal to the
atmosphere and makes the adventure decidedly charming.

The world itself is far more Carroll than Tolkien, and the difference
shines through (though there's nothing inherently wrong with traditional
I-F fantasy as it currently stands).  The perfect length, nice prose, a
couple of clever puzzles, and a surprisingly good parser and DOS-based
game engine.  It doesn't break any new ground, and it's not &quot;<a href = "u.html#uncle">Uncle
Zebulon's Will</a>,&quot; but it carries the same spirit and it made me want to
visit the land beyond the picket fence again soon.

TITLE: Last Resort
AUTHOR: Jim Aikin
EMAIL: editor SP@G musicwords.net
DATE: December 2, 2006
PARSER: Inform 6
SUPPORTS: Glulx interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware; IF Archive
URL: <a href="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/LastResort.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/LastResort.zip</a>
VERSION: Release 1

In his newsgroup discussions of his new game and on his webpage devoted to it, 
Mr. Aikin set it up as something bold and fairly experimental.  "Last Resort," 
he tells us, "is an attempt to use the medium of interactive fiction for a 
serious story with an actual plot."  I thus downloaded the game expecting to 
find something that, successful or not, would at least push the envelope of the 
possible.  I was surprised to find instead a well put-together, well-tested, and 
well-written work of IF... but one that does little or nothing really new with 
the form.  It's not that Mr. Aikin was being dishonest.  Last Resort IS a 
serious story with an actual plot.  It's just that there have been plenty of 
serious stories with actual plots before in IF, and Mr. Aikin's tone had somehow 
made me feel that he meant something new in using those words.  

Be that as it may, there is nothing here that advances the form in any new 
directions.  Luckily, though, there is a lot to like about this one.  In this 
age of bite-sized IF, a big, solidly designed effort like this is worthy of 
celebration on its own merits.

The plot casts the player as a fourteen year old girl from New York who has been 
dragged off to the tumbledown resort camp of Eternal Springs in Mississippi by 
her spinster aunt.  Once there, she quickly begin to realize that things are not 
right.  Evil is afoot!  The resort is actually a front for a demon-worshipping 
cult, and in some four hours of game time she will be sacrificed... unless she 
can thwart the plans of the cult.

Like much -- arguably too much -- IF before it, Last Resort settles itself 
firmly into the genre of Lovecraftian horror.  I find it surprising that so many 
IF authors continue to go down this road, as <a href="a.html#anchor">Anchorhead</a> nailed the genre so well
that it seems to me that virtually anything else -- including (retroactively) 
even Infocom's The Lurking Horror -- is likely to come up short in comparison.  
Anyway, I tend to find a more understated, psychological approach to horror 
infinitely more chilling than Lovecraft's wild ravings about unnamable horrors 
from other dimensions gibbering EVILY.  Even a bit of good old Satan worshipping 
would have gone down pretty well, and this was in fact the direction I initially 
thought the game was going in when I found, first, a Bible with particularly 
violent and disturbing passages marked, and then a rather creepy, thoroughly 
unholy priest.  I had decidedly mixed feelings when I realized what direction it 
was actually going in.  

And so, perhaps inevitably and certainly not unexpectedly, the plot of Last 
Resort suffers in comparison with Anchorhead.  I think that much of the problem 
is down to a failure to maintain dramatic tension.  The game is indeed, as 
advertised by Aikin, non-linear, but I'm not sure that its story is the better 
for it.  Basically, the player can wander freely over its fairly extensive 
terrain -- for which Mr. Aikin has helpfully provided a PDF map -- right from 
the beginning, attempting to solve the variety of puzzles that block her from 
thwarting the cult's plans and effecting her escape from the resort.  There are 
a few timed and triggered events, but not enough to make the game feel like a 
satisfying story rather than just a collection of static obstacles to conquer.  
The plot has no real climax as all.  If she solves all of the puzzles in time, 
she leaves the island on which the resort is situated and it's game over, 
accompanied by a massive case of anti-climax.  If not, she is sacrificed and 
that's that.  Something more is definitely needed here.

But if the plot is a bit thin, there is much else to appreciate.  The puzzles 
are sometimes difficult, but generally satisfying.  The writing is detailed and 
evocative, and the scenery is well-implemented throughout.  Eternal Springs in 
all its overheated, dilapidated splendor feels like a real place.

Two things really set Last Resort off from games like it from five or ten years 
ago.  One is the aforementioned level of scenery implementation.  The other is 
the NPCs.  There are quite a few of them here, all vividly described and 
memorable, if sometimes a bit cliched.  They aren't terribly active -- most stay 
in the same place pretty much throughout the game -- but they have a surprising 
amount to say.  Almost any reasonable query that these people SHOULD know 
something about they DO.  Inform unfortunately does not (yet) have anything of 
quite the sophistication of the TADS 3 conversation model, but Mr. Aikin has 
made good use of the tools he does have.  This contributed greatly to my 
enjoyment of the game, and is I suspect the main reason that the it ballooned to 
a size too big for the Z-Machine to contain.  I hate to think of the amount of 
work that must have gone into Mr. Aikin's characters.

Last Resort is not a terribly easy game.  As mentioned previously, there is a 
time limit, which is something I generally have mixed feelings about.  The game 
is quite generous as such things go, though, allowing plenty of time for 
exploration.  I actually never ran out of clock in my time with the game, 
although I was always aware of the time limit and thus occasionally restored to 
an earlier point after spending too much time going down some fruitless path or 
another.

It is also quite possible to make the game unwinnable.  The game will not warn 
its player in any obvious way when this happens, but just continue merrily 
onward.  I think that the reasonably careful player will, however, generally be 
able to recognize these situations.  The key here is to approach Last Resort as 
a text adventure, not a piece of interactive literature, contrary as this may be 
to the expectations created by Mr. Aikin's own comments on his game.  Hint: If 
you find yourself asking why no one comments on the fact that you are carrying 
around several dozen bizarre, non-related items in a huge sack like a fourteen 
year old Santa Claus, or how this young girl is able to lift this much assorted 
junk in the first place, you are officially in the wrong frame of mind.  

Luckily, I like text adventures a lot, and this is, all things considered, a 
pretty darn good one.  Together with my girlfriend I was able to solve all but 
two of its puzzles.  At least one of those two -- the final step in clearing the 
dog away from the shed door -- I thought was a bit dodgy, but then every game 
seems to have at least one.  Overall, Last Resort is a fine piece of work that 
will likely consume several evenings of happy adventuring.  All but the most 
puzzle-averse should definitely give it a go.

<A NAME="leather"><h2>Leather Goddesses of Phobos</h2>
From: Graeme Cree &lt;72630.304 SP@G compuserve.com&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag4.html">SPAG #4</a> -- March 2, 1995

  NAME:  Leather Goddesses of Phobos  GAMEPLAY:  Infocom Standard
  AUTHOR:  Steve Eric Meretzky        PLOT:  Excellent
  EMAIL:  ?                           ATMOSPHERE:  Excellent
  AVAILABILITY:  Mail Order (maybe)   WRITING:  Excellent
  PUZZLES:  Excellent                 SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports
  CHARACTERS:  Very Good              DIFFICULTY:  Advanced

        In this risque imitation of 1930's pulp fiction, you are captured by
the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.  For some reason, you escape, and with your
trusted companion Trent/Tiffany, you tour the Solar System searching for a
collection of incongruous objects, which when put together will form a
super-duper-anti-Leather-Goddesses-of-Phobos-attack-machine.
        The game begins by patting itself on the back for the outraged
reactions that it will likely induce in old fuddy-duddies, though truth be
told it is not much dirtier than your average beer commercial (though it is
much more clever).  The game has three naughtiness modes for dealing with sex
scenes:

     TAME - No sex scenes
     SUGGESTIVE - You're told that the scene is happening, but no more
     LEWD - Level of description about equal to a Harlequin novel

        In addition, Lewd mode has one or two 4-letter words, seemingly
thrown in out of some sense of obligation, as they don't mesh very well with
Meretzky's humour at all.
        The game wonderfully recreates the feel of 30's pulp fiction, from
the swordfight on the hull of the Space Battleship (without spacesuits,
naturally), to the Sultan and other colourful characters you meet on Mars, to
the delightfully contrived situation at the South Pole, to the marvelous
running gag concerning the lucky escapes of your faithful companion.  The
final scene where you try to assemble your machine while under attack by all
of the Leather Goddesses minions is one of the greatest moments in
interactive fiction, and one that would be utterly impossible to reproduce
with graphics.
        I generally enjoy games like <A HREF="s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</A> that spread the action over
a wide area, and Leather Goddesses has one of the widest areas of all, with
the action ranging between Venus, Mars, Phobos, Earth, and Saturn orbit.
        Leather Goddesses has some of the best freebies of any Infocom game,
including a 3-D comic book, 3-D glasses, and a scratch and sniff card.  It
was one of the five games made into a Solid Gold edition.  The Solid Gold
edition contains not only onscreen hints, but the ability to get through the
difficult catacombs maze with a single special command.  The game also allows
you to play as either a male or a female, depending on which restroom you
enter at the beginning.
        Some early editions of the game had a Lost in the Desert maze in
place of the Martian Desert room.  I have only heard of this edition, not
seen it, and if anyone has a copy, I'd love to see it.  The non-Solid Gold
editions of the game had a &quot;Boss key,&quot; whereby you could bring a specially
created text file onscreen by hitting Control-B.  The file included with the
game was a sample screen of Infocom's Cornerstone database, the easy-to-use
productivity software that almost [Well, did.  Let's be honest. -GKW]
bankrupted the company.  Later Infocom games that used the same interpreter
also had the Boss key feature, though it was never mentioned.
        A sequel is promised at the end of the game.  This was released as
a graphic adventure in 1992 by Activision/Infocom, but this is already out of
print, and probably getting difficult to find.  LGOP2 promised yet a third
installment, but there is no word on this.
        All in all, Leather Goddesses of Phobos is one of Infocom's best
efforts.

        [A few brief notes.  MINOR SPOILER, beware!  That boss key screen is
a real chuckle, and if you have the version with it, definitely read it over

VERSION: Release 10

Paul O'Brian's LASH is a puzzler (and not in the sense that it's full of
puzzles). It's an intriguing story, well told, and technically it all
hangs together well. The writing is strong, and the exploration options
wildly diverse--there are lots and lots of endings and different options
to explore, and any given player is unlikely to see all the text the
game has to offer without the aid of TXD. But for LASH to really work as
interactive fiction, it has to resonate emotionally with the player, and
unfortunately the nature of the story makes significant emotional impact
somewhat unlikely.

The backstory is complicated and intricately done, and the game sets it
up nicely. The Second American Civil War has come and gone, and you're
picking through the rubble, looking for valuables, via satellite link to
your handy robot. The documentation leaves some ambiguity about whether
your ostensible aim is historical knowledge rather than simple lucre,
but the trajectory of the game tends to shape your character into a
looter rather than a historian. (The SCORE function, for instance,
tracks your earnings.) At any rate, you're searching through a mansion
that dates to before the First American Civil War, and your robot acts
as your eyes and ears, to some extent at least. The premise, therefore,
is terrific--at least, I thought so. I love reconstructing stories from
clues and bits of information, and LASH seemed initially to be taking
that path.

It turns out that it doesn't, really; you end up exploring the past, but
not in the way I'd expected, and what does happen, for lack of a better
way to put it, isn't quite as subtle as pure historical reconstruction
might have been. To be sure, the other way might have been unsubtle too,
but my main reaction to the way LASH told its story was, okay, I get it,
don't yell at me. It's certainly not a bad story, nor is it badly told,
and the subject has hardly even been touched on in IF; there's nothing
inherently wrong with any of it. But the game throws you so suddenly
into the scenes that should affect you that it's easy to become detached
from it all--you don't have enough time to get to know the central
character before the relevant events begin. It's also clear that the
distancing is, to some extent, deliberate; it matches a similar
distancing that is going on in the game (arguably, in fact, two of
them)--but as well as it works from a theoretical standpoint, it
undermines the game's effect on the player. Likewise, there's a sequence
toward the end of the game that's cleverly done--subtly, even--and yet,
even when the player recognizes what's going on, it's unlikely to pack
much of an emotional punch. Appreciation of the author's craft, perhaps,
but that's not quite the same.

As noted, LASH offers the player lots to do; some of the puzzles and
problems have a significant effect on the outcome, and some don't,
though there's not really a single way to "win" as such. Solving certain
problems gives your character more money, of course, but it's not really
clear that that's an unequivocal good, or sufficiently so that you
should be striving for it at the expense of other goals. There's an odd
division going on, however, between items and events that are there
purely for historical perspective and those that merely represent more
money, and it isn't even always clear whether solving the few puzzles
there are (most of which are optional) will lead to insight or to
riches. The player who's interested in one more than the others may be
disappointed, in other words, to find that solving a given puzzle won't
advance his chosen goal. To the extent the bifurcation represents a
split between the player and the character, it's an interesting
division, but it also makes for some awkwardness.

And yet LASH also has a lot going for it. It's thoroughly researched,
for one thing; there isn't much IF that could be called historical, but
if other authors put as much thought and effort into historical IF as
this one did, there's plenty that can be done with the genre. The
quality of the research is manifested not so much in the story or
characters, which are a mite on the generic side, as in the details of
the setting--objects, customs, map layout. When, as here, the reality of
the historical scenes depicted is part of the point, it seems all the
more important to get things right, and LASH cannot be faulted in that
regard. It's also possible to screw up in a variety of interesting ways
that shed light on the story; step outside the realistic constraints of
your role and you're in trouble. (It's tempting at several moments to do
rather unwise things, in other words, things that might seem perfectly
appropriate to the generic IF adventurer, and the game reminds you quite
forcefully that you're not the generic IF adventurer.) The writing is
strong throughout, enough so that the historical setting comes across
vividly and the Wishbringer doubled-landscape trick is believable (and
highly atmospheric).

LASH is a well-thought-out, polished work of IF that I wanted to like
more than I did, sadly; I recognized its good intentions, but I didn't
respond as viscerally as I suspect the game wanted me to, and ultimately
my experience became more detached appreciation for the author's skill
in crafting the technical aspects of the game (which is considerable)
than real involvement in what the game was trying to do. In that it's
difficult to say categorically that others will share my reactions, I
recommend that all fans of good IF give it a shot, but I consider it
only a partial success.

NAME: Leaves

VERSION: Release 3

I must say that there were plenty of things about Leaves that I did
like, or at least didn't mind. The puzzles weren't extraordinarily
clever, but they weren't dreadful either, the prose was largely
competent, and the story reasonably compelling though
minimalist. There were some plot holes, naturally, but they weren't
too outrageous, and generally this was on course for perhaps a 4,
perhaps a 5. And then, well, a certain moment happened, and I revised
everything downward several notches.

First, though: ALAN came off reasonably well here. One important
object was hidden effectively--the game didn't recognize the noun
until you'd actually found the object--and though some logical
commands weren't coded and some verbs were a bit clumsy, I doubt that
actually had much to do with ALAN. The most glaring flaw was the lack
of a scripting command--there was no way, as far as I could tell, to
keep a transcript, and no documentation either within or outside the
game that provided advice about such things. (Meaning that all those
ALAN advocates shouldn't bombard me with angry messages saying that,
yes, there's a command, it's &quot;transcriptify.&quot; I'm sure there is. No
one actually mentioned it to me, though.) That aside, everything
seemed fairly solid, though there weren't a lot of complicated things
going on either.

The author is a native of Finland, and I'm not sure what his
familiarity with English is, but this is, by and large, well-written;
there are some ungrammatical moments here and there (a tree is &quot;no
more different&quot; from other trees, pointless actions are sometimes
rewarded with &quot;Now that would be the trick&quot;), but on the whole the
writing is competent, and sometimes even wryly funny. (If you try to
chop up a tree with the wrong tool: &quot;Cut a tree with a knife?
Marvellous idea.&quot; And kicking most objects elicits &quot;This is not a
football game.&quot; ) Though plenty of familiar verbs weren't implemented,
notably &quot;touch&quot; and &quot;climb&quot; and &quot;move&quot;, the writing here is adequate
for the purposes--the game isn't long enough, nor are actions complex
enough, for it to feel deficient.

The plot is sorta rudimentary. You're escaping from, er, something--a
prison, a concentration camp? Dunno. But you get out--hence the
&quot;leave&quot; aspect, which actually makes this one of the cleverest titles
of the competition--and just keep going. Incongruities along the way
include a _very_ dense guard, one rather bizarre character, and more
cutting tools and puzzles in which to apply them than you can shake a
proverbial stick at. Still, if you can live with a little absurdity,
the story of Leaves isn't bad; in its own minimalist way, it works
reasonably well. The puzzles are uneven--one conditions your finding
an object on a completely unrelated (and fairly stupid) action, and
one, a maze, is sheer guess-what-the-author's-thinking, but they don't
make the game unplayable; they fit with the absurdist plot. Truth to
tell, I had accepted the game's absurdities early on and wasn't
particularly troubled when I hit on illogical solutions; one thing one
doesn't do with Leaves is take it seriously. (One of the odder bits,
actually, is that certain directions are given but the game prevents
you from using them, sometimes for no obvious reason--e.g., &quot;You
really don't want to go there.&quot; It did give the game a certain
tension--what's more frightening than the unknown and
unmentionable?--but it was a strange touch.

And then...for the uninitiated, there's a puzzle toward the end of the
game that is possibly the most blatant instance on record of an author
assuming that the player is a straight male. (Well, okay, I suspect
that things like &quot;Softporn Adventure&quot; do more in that respect, but at
least there the title is a warning.) Now, Mr. Vuorinen was 14 when he
wrote that puzzle, or so he suggests in the notes, and 14-year-old
boys are not known for their maturity regarding matters of sexuality,
and though I doubt I'd look kindly on the 14-year-old Mr. Vuorinen
submitting that puzzle, I might be less annoyed. But 10 years have
passed since then, it seems, and including it in its current form goes
well beyond bad taste. Quite apart from the sheer perversity of the
concept--those are ROCKS you're so excited about--the author insists
on putting everything in schoolboy language and on giving the player a
sort of juvenile fascination about it all. (Plus, well, solving the
puzzle in the first place requires entering the mind of a 14-year-old
boy, since the solution doesn't really jump out at the rest of us.)
This is not the place for a discussion of sex in IF, but I _know_ it
can be done better than this. (The author's preoccupations don't only
come out in this, actually; reading through the data file for this is
not particularly edifying.) As I indicated, this little sequence
brought down the game several notches in my estimation. Sex is one
thing; sex handled in juvenile fashion is another.

Most of Leaves is competently put together, I found, though not always
with much of an ear for logic; there are few glaring flaws. If Mr.
Vuorinen can refrain from severe lapses of judgment, he might help
make ALAN a presence in the IF community; this effort, though, gets a
3 from me.

<A NAME="legend"><h2>The Legend Lives!</h2>

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag5.html">SPAG #5</a> -- April 19, 1995

NAME: The Legend Lives!                 PARSER: TADS + WorldClass
AUTHOR: David M. Baggett                PLOT: Visionary
EMAIL: dmb SP@G ai.mit.edu                   ATMOSPHERE: Incredibly rich
AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF Archive             WRITING: Extremely good
PUZZLES: Creative                       SUPPORTS: TADS ports
CHARACTERS: Unfulfilled potential       DIFFICULTY: Slightly above average

_The Legend Lives!_ is probably one of the most highly anticipated text 
adventures since the demise of Infocom.  Written by David Baggett, author 
of the popular shareware game &quot;<a href = "u.html#unnkul2">Unnkulian Unventure II</a>&quot;, _Legend_ takes 
the Unnkulian Universe far into the future.  However, it is a future 
where despite the soaring technological advancements of mankind (and 
creaturekind in general), the threat of the dread Unnkulians still 
lurks.  You, as student Gavin Kelly, stumble upon the most horrifying 
plot the Unnkulians have ever unleashed as a part of your thesis 
research.  Your quest will take you across the universe and even through 
time as you seek to once again penetrate the secrets of the Akmi 
corporation and uphold the tenets of Dudhism.

However, _Legend_ was not so highly anticipated just because it's another 
game in the popular Unnkulian series.  It was billed as an experiment of 
sorts, an attempt to see if the interactive fiction medium can be used to 
do more than just provide entertaining puzzles -- to see if IF can be 
used to make a statement, convey a message, really get inside your head 
and make you think.  In this, _Legend_ succeeds admirably.  The emphasis 
here is clearly not on the puzzles (although there are plenty of those) 
but rather on the experience: the atmosphere, the writing, the message.  

To this end, there are a fair number of very long text sequences which 
are many pages and contain a great deal of conversation between the 
player (you) and certain NPCs.  These &quot;vignettes&quot; are the strongest 
point of the whole game.  They are very well written and loaded with all 
sorts of allegory and subtleties.  I was disappointed that there were not 
more of these &quot;cut scenes,&quot; in fact, because they add a lot to the 
storytelling aspect.  I certainly don't mind reading 10 screens of text 
if it helps to advance the story and give me something to think about.  
And _Legend_ will definitely give you something to think about.

I won't spoil the plot for you, but I should mention the overall &quot;quest&quot;:
the goal of the game is to thwart an unbelievably powerful computer virus 
unleashed by the Unnkulians which is self-aware, self-replicating, and 
taking over the entire universal computer network.  Once it has 
established control over the technology, it will have established control 
over the people, and the Unnkulians' dream will be fulfilled.  This of 
course would be a Very Bad Thing (tm) for the rest of creation, and you 
are the only person who is even aware that the virus exists.  
Unfortunately, Akmi (the corporation which runs basically everything and 
controls nearly all information) is on to you and they will attempt to 
foil you as you try to gain information about and eventually defeat the 
virus, thus saving all of creation from an Unnkul fate (sorry).

Of course, you can't do it alone; and _Legend_ provides a suitable cast 
of NPCs to help you (or hinder you).  There are computer programmers, a 
star musician, aliens of various sorts, and an artificial intelligence 
program, among others, who will appear along the way.  Sadly, this is 
where _Legend_ suffers the most.  The NPCs are not developed well 
enough.  In fact, some of them are not developed at all.  This is a real 
shame, because there is an awesome amount of potential in these 
characters.  I was really disappointed by this aspect of the game, but 
the quality of the writing goes a long way to make up for it, and the 
environment (the &quot;Unnkulian&quot; mythos) is top-notch.  Still, no story can 
be fully successful without effective, quality characterization.

And there will be obstacles in your path; after all, defeating the 
nefarious schemes of the unnkulians will require you to be even more 
devious than they.  There are a good number of puzzles in the game, 
ranging from very easy to quite difficult.  However, David did not want 
players to get distracted from the story by being stuck on a puzzle, so 
he provides a remarkable &quot;adaptive hint system&quot;  which will give you 
intelligent hints based on your current situation.  There is no penalty 
for using the hints, or limit to how many you can use, but be warned that 
they do go right on up to the outright spoiler level after the first 
couple of hints.  Luckily, there is an encryption feature you can turn on 
to prevent yourself from reading all the hints too quickly.  The game is 
difficult; however, I was able to finish it in about a week without 
needing to resort to the hints.  Nice to have them if you want them, 
though, and the hint system is really a great piece of work.

As for the quality of the puzzles themselves, they are by and large very 
good.  (And no mazes!).  Most of the puzzles are logical and fair, and 
I got a real sense of satisfaction out of solving them.  There are 
exceptions to this rule of course; but every game has a few bad spots.  I 
would imagine that most people will need a hint or three as they go 
through the game.  Then again, I didn't, so you might not either.  Some 
of the puzzles are very tricky, though.  Others, however, can be solved 
purely by dumb luck -- i.e., having the right item in your inventory when 
you speak to a particular character.  Puzzles like that irritate me.  
However, as I have said, the puzzles are not the emphasis in _Legend_.  
They are supposed to add to the story instead of distract from it, and 
for the most part this is fairly successful.

Until you get to the end of the game.  This is my biggest complaint about 
_Legend_.  The ending is a tremendous disappointment.  Not because it's 
an emotional downer or anything like that; it's just totally unexpected 
and very unsatisfying.  I would say that the ending seems like an 
afterthought, except that it was obviously carefully written to make 
certain statements.  Unfortunately they fall flat and there is not a 
satisfactory resolution to the main plot themes.

However, I cannot in good faith say anything *too* bad about the game, 
because it's one of the most visionary and daring works to come along 
since, well, <A HREF="m.html#amfv">A Mind Forever Voyaging</A> from Infocom.  Honestly, AMFV is 
the better game, but _Legend_ is damn fine as well.  If you liked AMFV, I 
think you will not be disappointed by _Legend_.  If you like good 
puzzle-solving games, you won't be disappointed by _Legend_.  If you like 
good writing and lots of prose, you won't be disappointed by _Legend_.  
If you like a great atmosphere and enticing plot, you certainly won't be 
disappointed.  The only place _Legend_ fails is that it does not exploit 
the incredible amount of potential for characterization.  But you 
probably will forget that in the wake of all the other images _Legend_ is 
going to throw at you.

Let me sum it up this way: _The Legend Lives!_ is not the best IF game I 
have ever played in my life.  It is, however, the best IF game I have 
*experienced* in a very long time.  That, perhaps, is the highest 
recommendation I can give.  Hats off to David Baggett for a fun game 
which is also a fine work of fiction.  Even though it doesn't completely 
succeed in getting the message across, _Legend_ really pushes the 
envelope and challenges our definitions of interactive fiction.  It also 
challenges a lot of other things, like our relationship with technology 
(a major theme of the work).  _Legend_ deserves to be played if for no 
other reason than to think about what David is trying to say.  I mean, 
when was the last time you played an IF game which *really* had a message 
and a vision?  Maybe never.  Well, now's your chance.

And best of all, it's freeware, which means that after reading this review 
you have absolutely no excuse for not downloading it right now and playing it.

You'll be glad you did.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag30.html">SPAG #30</a> -- September 20, 2002 -- as part of a Review Package

In previous reviews, I've been trying -- I know, with varying success
-- to remain objective, and not to over-praise the reviewed games.
But now we got to a game that can't be over-praised;). I think it's a
true gem among other Unnkulian games (that doesn't mean the others
are bad, mind you), and deserves to be called a classic not less
than, say, <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses!</a>, or <a href = "s.html#spider">Spider And Web</a>.

...And now, I'm going to try digging up some grounds for this rather
daring statement. ;)

Let's start with the setting. The game is set in a rather far future,
with space travelling, and matter moving, and stuff, and it must be
said that the game world is very convincing. It seemed alive alright
-- but at the same time, I got the feeling of being inside a somewhat
buggy program. Well, it must be said that in the last few years, our
*real* world often gives me the same feeling -- very much because of
the steadily intensifying rhythm of life, and the growing amount of
hack-work in all spheres. In this respect, Mr. Baggett's work turned
out to be prophetical -- in 1994, the year when Legend was released,
life wasn't quite like that, though the trends certainly were
present. Let's add that the scenery in Legend is one of the richest
in the whole IF-history -- one could spend a couple of hours just
playing with the gadgets in the game, or watching EV (the Unnkulian
analogue of our TV). The "create a world that'd be fun to explore"
approach clearly rules here; the player is taken through a number of
vastly different worlds -- from a computer centre to a rural
backwater, from a crowded supermarket to jungle -- and yet, all of
them feel like parts of a whole. Furthermore, the author cleverly
uses the opportunities provided by the futuristic technologies (in
particular, matter moving) to consequently continue the war against
linearity he declared in <a href = "u.html#unnkul2">Unnkulia 2</a>. For instance, Legend can't be
mapped out in principle -- only the separate areas of it, because you
travel from one area to another via matter movers. And while the
gameplay is somewhat more directed than in Unnkulia 2, because the
goals stand out much better here, the player still has a lot of
freedom. Yes, there is a prescribed set of puzzles you need to solve
to win the game -- but you can, to a quite significant extent,
determine the order for them to be solved.

Which brings us to the puzzles as such.

At the very start, Legend tries to scare players off by declaring its
difficulty rating is 10 out of 10; but let me assure you -- it isn't
that difficult. Yes, the puzzles are hard, but they are very logical,
too. I'm not very good at puzzle-solving, but I managed to get
through the game using the built-in hints only for three puzzles (of
those three, one was a riddle, which traditionally represents a
stumbling-block for me, and one I'd probably solve without help if I
kept trying for a few more days -- as it turned out, I was working in
the right direction) -- though it took me a few weeks. Take this as a
hint -- I'm not the most persistent person, but I was perfectly
willing to spend so much time on the puzzles. And remember me saying
that most games reviewed here, with little exception, are packed with
OGDs? Well, Legend is such an exception.

Legend has been criticized for not having its NPCs developed enough.
I'd disagree; to me, it rather seemed that Mr. Baggett was
experimenting with animation techniques - probably because he had got
disappointed in the traditional "ASK ABOUT/TELL ABOUT" method. Among
other things, he used long "cut-scenes" of non-interactive text for
those purposes -- but since references to such "cut-scenes" in
reviews of Legend have become commonplace, I won't say anything else
about them. I felt the characters were quite vivid; one of my
favorite moments was asking a visitor at Terminal Velocity about
something (though people with UNIX knowledge probably will appreciate
the response much more).

But the coolest thing about Legend is, it makes you THINK. Think
about... er, well, an enumeration probably would spoil the fun for
you. So, why not try to find out by yourself?

NAME: The Lesson of the Tortoise

AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)

VERSION: Release 1

You're an unlikely IF hero: Wang Lo, a small but persevering and
prosperous Chinese farmer. Your adversaries: a serpent, your faithless
wife, and a disloyal farm hand. Your allies: a tortoise, your strapping
son, a trusting servant girl, and a ghostly ancestral apparition. Quite
a story ahead of you, wouldn't you think? Would you believe that the
game can be won in only 30 turns and contains only 9 locations? With the
economical prose characteristic of a folk tale, Whizzard drops you into
the Chinese folkloric past, sketches out characters and plot, and
delivers a moral, all in a very satisfying 30 minutes or so of play.

Whizzard has streamlined his game in several ways: One is to simplify
interactions with NPCs; verbal interactions are limited to &quot;talk to NPC&quot;
and giving them commands. Carryable objects are few, and ones that have
served their purpose are tidily moved out of the player's reach.

Even with these simplifications, the game does not feel sparsely
inhabited. The game understands most nouns that appear in room
descriptions. Default responses have been nicely handled, often changed
to reflect a more Confucian approach (&quot;That action seems unlikely to
save you, wise one.&quot;) than the epistemologically challenged standard
TADS parser responses (&quot;I don't know how to X the Y.&quot;).

The puzzles are sometimes a challenge, but Whizzard provides a
progressively more explicit hint system. The game therefore appeals to
puzzle fans and story fans. Puzzle fans can tough it out without the
hints. Story fans can breeze through the puzzles using hints, which is a
nice way to allow the story to flow easily, a great pleasure in this
game.

&quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; is one of those works that one approaches without 
really knowing what to expect. On one hand, it's been mentioned as 
small and simple, solvable in a few hours; on the other hand, there's 
the obscure, almost pretentious, title that implies a mythical 
significance. Add to that various comments -- including spoiler 
requests -- that hinted at great depths, and it felt like a 
&quot;must-play.&quot; I wasn't disappointed -- it turned out to be even more 
interesting than I had expected: &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; is an ambitious
attempt to deal with questions not normally addressed in IF, and an
attempt to extend the traditional adventure game to be able to do so.

At first, you are not very likely to notice much of this. The 
introduction is short and somewhat sinister: memories of a camping 
trip, and falling -- or stepping -- off a cliff, then nothing more until 
you find yourself in a slightly surrealistic fantasy world, with no
idea of how you got there or what to do next.

There is nothing very original about the opening -- the sudden 
abduction to a strange world seems to be becoming a cliche of IF -- nor 
about the world you've ended up in. In fact, everything in the world
is vaguely familiar: it seems to be assembled out of common IF icons
such as gazebos, bird cages and waterfalls. This is probably
intentional (an explanation is given later in the game) and does not imply 
any lack of originality on the part of the author -- the puzzles 
involving these familiar icons are perhaps not of stunning novelty, 
but they certainly don't feel old and worn either. The atmosphere in
this early part of the game is sweet and idyllic, somewhat reminiscent
of &quot;<A HREF="s.html#sound">The Sound of One Hand Clapping</A>,&quot; though there are dark undertones
that foreshadow later revelations.

After having you explore this tiny world (only 15 or so locations) and
solve a number of not too difficult puzzles, all at a rather languid
pace, the author suddenly turns the tables on his unsuspecting
audience. It is here that &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; changes from a light,
innocent puzzle game to rather dark interactive literature, that at
least attempts to touch deep, existential questions.

It starts innocently enough with a puzzle involving a spider and a 
mushroom. The conclusion of the puzzle is, however, not just an 
increased score and a longer inventory, but an entirely unexpected
series of events that plunges you into what first seems like a 
nightmare, plagued by ghosts from your past.

Via a series of essentially non-interactive &quot;cut scenes&quot; -- there is
seldom a choice of actions, but either just on obvious thing to do, 
which triggers another cut scene, or no option but to watch and listen 
as the plot advances by itself -- you are led to an encounter with the 
central NPC, Daniel, who in a long monologue explains what is going on
and how crucial a role you're actually playing in the scheme of
things.

The encounter with Daniel is the climax of &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix,&quot; and
acts as a centre of symmetry; it is followed first by another 
confrontation with your past, and then you are back where you were
before, in a &quot;traditional,&quot; puzzle-based adventure game. The
difference is that after meeting Daniel, you are prepared to do 
something about your past, to derive inner strength from it 
rather than just grieving over lost opportunities. Similarly, when
you're attacking the puzzles again, you are armed with the means to
manipulate not only the various objects in the world, but the world
itself. This enables you to go back and finish certain puzzles that 
were left open before, thus bringing everything to a satisfying
conclusion.

While not very original, the outer parts of the game are quite well 
written, with attention to detail even in objects that would normally 
be considered decorations. People who like red herrings will probably 
enjoy this; personally, I find significant-looking objects that turn 
out to be unimportant a bit of a distraction, but this is a matter of 
taste. On the other hand, the author sometimes fails to realize the
full potential of the really significant objects. The gazebo scene, 
for example, or the remote control, are wonderful devices with lots of 
possibilities for experimentation and clever puzzles; I was a bit
disappointed that in both cases the intended use for this complex
machinery was quite simple.

Still, in a game of this small size, it is perhaps just an advantage
to have simple puzzles. And though simple, the puzzles are not 
trivial. In most cases they require thinking in several steps and 
solving them gives you that nice feeling of accomplishment that is
perhaps the adventurer's best reward. There is only one NPC in the 
outer parts of the game. It is very simple and not very interactive, 
and anyway, in the case of this particular NPC it's quite in 
character.

I had a few parser problems (the most serious one being that you can
enter a cave by typing just &quot;enter&quot; in the right place, but the 
command &quot;enter cave&quot; gives the response &quot;I don't see any cave here&quot;), 
and the way the magnet is handled is extremely awkward, but my only
major complaint with the outer parts of the game is the very first
puzzle. Unfortunately, it is of the tired &quot;find food or you'll die&quot;
variety, and, as usual, the time before you starve is far too short, 
forcing you to restart from the beginning over and over again until 
you've found all the objects necessary to get food. The puzzle in 
itself is quite nice, but the time limit detracts considerably from 
the enjoyment. Perhaps it was put in to give a sense of urgency to
the rather placid early game, but in that case it is almost certainly
not the right method.

Apart from this, game-play flows smoothly and a reasonably
experienced adventurer should be able to solve it in a few sittings.

The central section is entirely different. Almost all the action
takes place in the cut scenes, and the player is led through the plot
without the option to deviate from the path, being told what he thinks
and feels, never really give a chance to act. The centre of the 
centre, so to speak, is entirely non-interactive; a story within the 
story, told by Daniel in a monologue that must be the longest speech 
by any IF character so far, at least outside &quot;<a href = "#legend">The Legend Lives</a>.&quot;

There are no real puzzles in this section, and the NPCs are essentially
non-interactive, although it is possible to extract some interesting
background information by asking Daniel questions after he has 
finished his speech. The author uses the cut scenes very effectively,
gradually leading the player into longer and longer, and less and less
interactive scenes. The writing is very good indeed, the imagery 
evocative, the language beautiful and poetic, without degenerating 
into empty effects -- and what is being said is important:  not only the 
background to the entire setting, but the player character's internal
conflicts and attempts to come to grips with his or her past.

Dan Shiovitz is addressing very deep questions for an adventure game
and perhaps he has chosen the only realistic way of doing so. Still,
I must confess that it fails to be really engaging.

I think one reason for this is simply the enormous contrast with the
outer parts of the game, and especially the differences in time scale.
Solving the first part of the game takes at least a few hours, during
which one gets into the mode of thought appropriate for a puzzle game.
Then one is presented with an enormous amount of text, which takes
perhaps ten minutes to read -- only to be abruptly dumped back into the 
remainder of the puzzle game, which will take some time to finish.
The effect is that what should be the central part and climax of the
work turns into a short interlude, while the rest of the game, which is
infinitely less important in terms of emotional content, dominates it 
totally.

Also, although the writing is excellent, I feel that the author attempts
too much. He certainly seems to have given his imagination free 
rein; the result is a story that combines fallen angels with alien
invaders, philosophical speculation with battle scenes; a struggle of 
enormous proportions -- and this is just the background. The player
character's immediate concern is not this cosmic drama, but coming to
grips with himself and with the ghosts of his past.

Somehow, this combination of myth and science fiction, legend and 
psychological drama, science fiction and ghost story, saving the world
and achieving personal fulfillment, all presented in just a few pages
of text, fails to have the desired impact just because it is _too_
powerful, too all-encompassing.

I'm not saying that it is impossible to combine these elements into 
one story, just that the author may be making it just a little bit too
hard for himself -- and for his readers. There are limits to the
ability so suspend disbelief. If the author had concentrated on one
or two aspects of this story, instead of trying to do everything at
once, it would have been much more effective; the message would have
come across much more powerfully without all the fireworks.

To summarize, &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; is a work with strong centrifugal
tendencies -- it flies apart into quite disparate components. Taken by 
themselves, these parts are perhaps not perfect, but very good indeed,
considering that this is the author's debut work. Together, they fail
to yield an artistic unit, partly because of the author's high
ambitions; however, he shouldn't be blamed for failing to achieve
everything but praised for even making the attempt. Without 
experimentation, we would never get anywhere.

&quot;;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; is very interesting for what it tries to achieve,
and the ways in which it succeeds or fails to succeed in doing so. It 
contains some pieces of excellent writing, as well as some good work 
in the invention of puzzles and intricate puzzle machinery. IF 
authors are advised to study it carefully.

And for everybody, authors or non-authors alike, it remains a very
enjoyable game.

It is universally acknowledged by writers of fiction that realistic 
characters are hard to do. Any adventure game programmer would add, I 
am sure, that maintaining that realism while making it possible to 
interact with characters is well beyond the current state of the art.

So what to do?  Keeping the interaction and accepting the loss of
realism is one approach, from the mysterious gentleman who 
occasionally robs the player in &quot;<A HREF="z.html#zork1">Zork</A>,&quot; to the unseen and unsettling
presence of Cousin Herman in &quot;Hollywood Hijinx.&quot;  David Baggett, in his 
game &quot;<A HREF="#legend">Legend</A>,&quot; experimented with a variation on this approach, by 
confining most of the character exposition and major turning points in
the plot to 'cut scenes,' long conventionally narrated passages which
break up the more conventionally puzzle-oriented interactive action.

Dan Shiovitz's game &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; (1995) takes this approach to
its logical conclusion.  In this game, all plot, characterisation and
background is confined to the cut scenes, and the interactive portions
are completely unrelated to the ostensible plot.  The effect is
unnerving and surreal.

The matter of the plot is this:  You play an unhappy young man or woman 
experiencing an existential crisis.  While traveling in the American
desert to try to make sense of your life, a supernatural force pulls you 
off a cliff, and you find yourself in a fantasy world.  After some
exploring, you find a fallen angel called Daniel who explains that the
Earth is being invisibly taken over by alien invaders, and that you are
one of the chosen ones intended to fight this secret war.  [Spoilers 
removed.]

It's hard to imagine how an adventure game could get to grips with this
kind of powerful and emotional material, and Shiovitz doesn't even try.
The interactive parts of the story are conventional puzzle-solving
involving a talking tree, a levitating gazebo, a magic mushroom and
other fantastic trappings.  Various aspects seem intended to suggest
Brian Moriarty's game &quot;<A HREF="t.html#trinity">Trinity</A>&quot; (1986): there are giant mushrooms, and a
sun that moves and casts shadows on a giant sundial.  All very
entertaining, but it seems rather petty when compared to the 
Earth-shaking apparatus of the plot.

The most curious aspect of &quot;Lethe Flow Phoenix&quot; is how well done the 
individual parts are!  The puzzles are uniformly excellent and 
well-motivated (except for one curious action, which most players will
eventually work out for lack of anything else to do).  There are several 
impressively complex interactive mechanisms, which all seem to have been
coded flawlessly, and there are as many synonyms and alternate ways of
expressing actions as a player could want.  On the plot side, the 
writing is very fluent and readable despite the weightiness of the
material (although not up to the task of compressing God, angels, alien
invaders, human avatars, a deprived childhood, adolescent angst, family
breakdown and forgiveness into the space of a few screenfuls -- as if any 
writing could be!).  But the plot and the puzzles make a game bolted 
together like a Frankenstein monster: neither side supports the other, 
and the result is neither successful as a game, nor as a story.

Still, I look forward to Shiovitz's next game with interest; if he can
produce a game and story which go together to make something greater
than the sum of the two parts, the result will be very impressive.

NAME: The Light: Shelby's Addendum         PARSER: TADS 2.2
AUTHOR: C. A. McCarthy                     PLOT: Darkish science fiction
EMAIL: illusory SP@G execpc.com                 ATMOSPHERE: Excellent!

&quot;The Light: Shelby's Addendum&quot; is a fascinating piece of science-fiction IF
from a very talented writer, C.A. McCarthy (a regular contributor to the 
interactive fiction newsgroups as well).  The game casts you as Shelby,
the &quot;apprentice&quot; (functional equivalent of a graduate student) to the 
Regulators, two physicists who maintain a beacon which is critical to the
survival of the Earth (in between their studies of subsurface sonar
phenomena). When you return home from a trip to find that the beacon
is no longer alight, and no one seems to be left at the project site,
you must embark on a search for the truth behind the evil
happenings which have befallen the Lighthouse.  What fate has befallen
the Regulators?  What's happened to the phase modulator?  And why didn't 
anyone feed the chickens, for crying out loud?

As it turns out, you'll get to know the Regulators quite well before
meeting either one of them.  Barclay and Holcroft come to life through 
Shelby's observations on the everyday things around him, and through
other sources (a diary, for example).  You'll learn that something 
sinister is definitely afoot, and that one of the Regulators has placed 
all of Earth's inhabitants in danger by embarking an a dangerous &quot;quest&quot;
of his own.  His motivations, as well as his methods, must be unraveled
if Shelby is to succeed.

The first problem, however, is the fact that without the beacon, Shelby 
(and any other living thing) is out of phase with the rest of the world.  
If you do not find some way to prevent it (and quickly!) Shelby will meet 
a grisly death within just a few turns of the game's beginning.  In my 
opinion, the time limit imposed by the game to solve this first puzzle is
too tight.  You get 100 moves before dying, which may seem like a lot,
but trust me -- it's not.  This is definitely a &quot;restore puzzle&quot; and one 
which will probably take you several restarts to solve.

Which brings me to my only major complaint with the game: the puzzles.
&quot;The Light: Shelby's Addendum&quot; contains several puzzles which are more or 
less original in concept.  Unfortunately, they are terribly executed.
While a genuine attempt has been made by the author to integrate the 
puzzles into the story, the nature and difficulty of the puzzles is such
that they stick out like a sore thumb.  Not only are some of the more
important puzzles (like the first one you'll need to solve in order to 
stay alive) just downright obscure, the author has chosen to &quot;hide&quot; most
of the objects in the game deep within the scenery.  You'll need to look
under, over, around, behind, and through every single piece of scenery to 
avoid missing vital objects without which you cannot complete the quest.

In particular, the places where the keys are hidden on the mainland is 
extremely unfair.  Quite frankly, I don't recommend playing this game 
without at least a hint sheet (and probably a walkthrough) or you will
almost certainly become hopelessly stuck at any of several places.  You
may consider this &quot;puzzle wimpiness&quot; on my part, but consider that 
<A HREF="t.html#trinity">Trinity</A> and <A HREF="s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</A> are my two all-time favorite Infocom games, and
perhaps that will put my opinions of &quot;Shelby&quot;'s puzzles into perspective.

This is not to say that *all* of the puzzles are bad: several of them are 
quite clever, and the implementation of all the puzzles is basically
seamless (with one exception, but it doesn't affect your ability to
finish the game).  There's one puzzle near the end of the game which 
involves a weight-sensitive elevator and is quite nifty in its
execution.  In fact, the implementation of the whole game seems 
*very* solid.  I didn't discover any unknown bugs in the game, nor did I 
notice any typos (other than a couple of places where &quot;its&quot; was used 
instead of &quot;it's&quot;) and the game mechanics and pacing flowed beautifully.

In truth, despite the incongruency of the puzzles, I hasten to say that I 
enjoyed &quot;Shelby's Addendum&quot; a great deal. This game is well written.  The 
plot is great, there's a bit of horror (but nothing overboard), the 
characters are well developed (including the player's character, which is 
unusual in IF but handled beautifully here), and the room descriptions 
and scenery descriptions are vivid and consistently of the highest 
quality.  The &quot;cut scenes&quot; (areas of long text where various central 
characters interact) and the original storyline throughout made me think I
was reading a top-notch science-fiction short story instead of playing a 
computer game. Did I mention that I think the prose is *really* good? I
have to be sure and work that little tidbit into this paragraph somewhere.

There's an undertone of ecological (ir)responsibility in the game, but the
player is not really &quot;hit over the head&quot; with any kind of great theme or
moral message.  One does get a glimpse into how far a man might go to regain
that which he has lost, and a more convincing NPC than Barclay I have not
seen in an interactive fiction game for some time.  There is plenty of
material here for your philosophical brain cells to chew on, as well as a
good amount of technical descriptions and other &quot;futuristic&quot; science.
The game logic is consistent all the way through, and everything is eminently
believable.  The author has certainly created a seamless experience as 
far as I am concerned.

However, many players will be turned off by the puzzles.  I know that 
after several hours of extreme frustration when Shelby first came out, I
was unable to survive the 100-turn limit and put the game away for 
another day.  I just dragged it out today, actually, and pretty much 
lucked into the solution to that first puzzle.  Once you have managed to
locate the wall safe, however, the rest of the steps needed to 
preserve Shelby's physical integrity should be easier.  However, this is 
only the first of several major frustrations you will encounter.  The only
word of advice I can give to players is examine EVERYTHING.  And I mean
everything.  If a noun is mentioned in a room description, you had better 
look at it or you may well miss something crucial.  While I always have
been and remain a great advocate of the rule that &quot;if a noun is used in a 
room description, the player should be able to examine it,&quot; I believe 
that the author has gone a bit too far in making the player search for
important objects and other pieces of information in unlikely places.

In summary, &quot;The Light: Shelby's Addendum&quot; is not going to make my list of 
the top three interactive fiction games of the year, because frankly it
wasn't that much fun to play, what with the puzzles being such a mess.
However, it rates number one for 1996 in quality of writing, 
characterization, story, and plot.  This is a game which begs to be 
*read*.  This is a game which could have been published as a short story.
This is a game which, if you can get past the first few frustrations,
will reward you amply.  I've not played any of Colm's other games (he
mentions two in the accompanying text file), but I would sure like to 
read some of his fiction -- because his instincts as a writer are right 
on the money.  Some better puzzles and a bit less random searching, and
this would be one of the best games ever to come down the pipe.  As it
stands, &quot;Shelby&quot; is much like a lighthouse itself -- brief periods of 
dazzling illumination punctuated by deep darkness.  But the light
pierces, straight and true.  Give this one a chance, folks.

Also, I have to give a good review to any game which implements a full
bottle of the finest liquid refreshment on Earth, Guinness Extra Stout.
Brought a tear to my eye, it did.  The only thing I regretted was that 
there was only one bottle. :)

In this game you play Shelby, a young apprentice to the 'Regulators,' 
Holcroft and Barclay.  You live in a remote lighthouse where you 
nominally study physics, but actually spend most of your time cooking
and scrubbing floors.  Returning to the lighthouse after an extended
period of absence, you find that things have gone wrong.  An ominous
mist surrounds the lighthouse and Holcroft and Barclay are nowhere to be 
found.  It is up to you to find out what is the matter, and to put 
things right again.

Most of the fun in this game is figuring out the background to the world 
McCarthy has created here, so I won't reveal too much about it.  Suffice 
to say that this is a world somewhat like ours, but in which 'physics' 
is a very different subject from the physics we know.  The how and why
of this world is revealed tantalisingly slowly, a little but in the room 
descriptions, some more in books, magazines and other papers that you
read, and some more that you have to guess for yourself.  The idea of
alternate worlds, and the uses to which they might be put (if technology 
were to allow their manipulation), play a strong part in the rationale
for the plot and some of the game mechanics.  (However, it is a bit
disappointing that the working of the plot depends on so many people
being complete idiots!  If the 'phase modulator' is so essential that 
its removal can threaten the destruction of the world, why does the UN 
leave it to be guarded only by two old physicists?)

Although the discovery of the background is interesting, the actual 
mechanics of the game are disappointing.  Some of the text is good, 
notably the introductory paragraphs, but much of the rest is rather
lacklustre.  Room descriptions have a tendency towards lists of
furniture and exits, and there are rather too many rooms in which 
nothing happens (I counted 25 that could have been removed without
loss).  Far too many of the puzzles require you to read through the room 
description, examine every object mentioned and look under every piece
of furniture.  Several locations seem to be full of clutter for the 
express purpose of distracting you from the one object you need to 
investigate.

There are a few places where over-enthusiasm on the part of the writer 
rather spoils the atmosphere.  There's a submarine trip in which you're 
treated to jokey descriptions of characters from television programmes
(Flipper the dolphin, the puppets from &quot;Stingray&quot; and so on).  These 
seem completely out of place with the more serious tone of the rest of 
the game, and would have been better turned into Easter eggs.  Late on
in the game, with the island crumbling around you and doom approaching, 
you are treated to messages along the lines of &quot;All around you the 
earth groans horribly,&quot; presumably in order to instill in you some sense
of urgency.  But these messages appear every turn, and it turns out that
there is in fact no time limit, so after fifty or more repetitions the 
effect is ludicrous rather than alarming.

Some of the puzzles seemed completely arbitrary to me, and even after 
solving them I still don't understand why the solution worked.  For
example, there's a puzzle with two circles on the ground; if you put the 
right objects in the circles, a secret door opens.  As far as I can
tell, there are no clues to which objects to use.  Another puzzle uses
an oxygen cylinder and a pump to make a submarine appear; I might have 
understood this if the submarine had been in an underground chamber full 
of water that needed to be pumped out, but in fact the submarine
appeared in the open sea.  So what was the oxygen used for?

Some other puzzles are made difficult by programming errors:  There's a 
trapdoor in the ceiling which is too high to reach, but you might not 
realise this because the commands 'touch trapdoor,' 'push trapdoor' and 
so on give messages that suggest you can touch it.  A pivoting balance 
is implemented so that it only moves when you put an object on one of 
the plates.  If you change the weight of an object while it's on the 
plate, the balance stays where it is.

However, a few of the puzzles are well done:  Two cleverly-clued password 
puzzles gave me an &quot;Aha!&quot; feeling when I got them right the first time.

I've been rather harsh in this review; there are good aspects to &quot;The 
Light: Shelby's Addendum,&quot; and it would not have been out of place had 
it appeared as a mid-period Infocom game.  But I didn't enjoy playing it 
very much because the moments of excitement were few and far between.  I 
had expected the eventual encounter with Barclay and Holcroft to liven 
things up a bit, but, when they do appear, these characters are passive 
and unresponsive, implemented with the minimum of effort necessary to 
carry them from their rediscovery to their disappearance a handful of 
turns later.  The one point in the game that really ought to be exciting -- 
a ding-dong fight between Barclay and Holcroft in an underground 
laboratory -- was made completely non-interactive, with nothing for the 
player to do but yawn as several screenfuls of text scroll by.

So THIS is what Andrew Plotkin meant when he announced that his entry
this year wouldn't be interactive fiction.

He wasn't kidding.  Aside from the genie who (sort of) guides you
through, there is little prose, not much interaction with an
artificial world, and even less storytelling.  Players expecting
another &quot;<A HREF="c.html#change">Change in the Weather</A>&quot; or &quot;<a href = "s.html#sofar">So Far</a>&quot; are bound to be
disappointed.  Instead, the bulk of this &quot;game&quot; is a stripped-down
interpreter for Scheme, a streamlined derivative of LISP.

This makes for an intereating use of the Z-Machine, and a nice
complement to the likes of &quot;Robots,&quot; &quot;Z-Life,&quot; and Andrew's own
&quot;Freefall,&quot; but it's really more for programmers, or persons at least
interested in the subject.  I've heard from non-programmers who didn't
get much out of it, some of whom became hopelessly confused.

This is not to fault Plotkin's skills as a writer.  Indeed, he has a
knack for making this sort of thing fun for players possessing the
natural aptitude for it.  (Even &quot;<A HREF="i.html#inhumane">Inhumane</A>,&quot; his attempt at I-F as a
14-year-old, as its moments.)  Although &quot;Lists&quot; barely scratches the
surface of Scheme's capabilities, I was surprised by how much
functionality was crammed into such a small program, particularly with
the ease-of-use features.  Even if you complete all of the sample
exercises within the two-hour time limit, there's plenty more to come
back and investigate afterwards.  I'm dying to see the Inform source
code for this.

Now if only Activision would give us Infocom's ZIL compiler and docs
(ZIL being the LISP-like language used by Infocom's programmers), I
might have a real-world application for this, and a motivation to
learn more about the subjects presented here.

VERSION: Release 1

Little Blue Men is, at bottom, a highly bizarre game. It begins in a
ho-hum office setting and abruptly shifts into...well, it's hard to
say.  Sci-fi/horror/dystopia/fantasy, maybe. The result, though uneven
in spots, is certainly unique, and rather disturbing as well: familiar
elements of the office environment are given a sinister cast, and the
game is enlivened throughout by macabre humor.

The game begins with you at your desk doing menial tasks, and it can
end there very quickly as well unless you, the player, decide to put
down your menial tasks at a certain point and go explore the rest of
the office. In other words, the game gives you a quick &quot;ending&quot; after
about five moves and doesn't emphasize that this ending is
suboptimal. In an IF Competition rife with one-room or one-puzzle
games, the size of the story file might be the only thing keeping the
player from missing most of the game. This is an issue mainly because
the game keeps you from wandering away at first, and provides minimal
motivation for you to get up and wander around; it's not clear _why_
you do what you do. The problem of unclear motivations recurs later,
as the game transforms into, well, whatever it is: some of your
actions have no obvious reasons. The author, to be fair, was trying to
explore the idea of a protagonist motivated by evil ends--or, at
least, ends with which the player cannot easily sympathize.  It's an
underdeveloped area in IF, and this is an intriguing stab at it.  But
without some flashes of intuition in that regard, the player is likely
to discover what the character's goals are through the hints, which
doesn't exactly have the same effect.

As the game progresses, though, and the genre/setting becomes more
clear, the author delivers several excellent shock-twists in ways
reminiscent of <a href = "d.html#delusions">Delusions</a>, and just as effective. Once the player
accepts the premise (and figures out what it is), Little Blue Men is
terrific sci-fi in a vaguely absurdist way. Some lengthy speeches by
NPCs could have come straight out of schlocky movies or books, but
that just adds to the overall effect here: the author's main satirical
theme is the line between irritating office banality and sheer evil,
and the game plays the dichotomy for all it's worth. The puzzles
largely reinforce that: most involve putting conventional office
objects to new, devious uses, or turning humdrum objects into weapons,
or conquering perennial office irritations (like the blaring smoke
detector or the fickle vending machine). The cross-genre nature of the
game leaves a lot of unanswered questions, of course--more backstory
would help--but the dystopia part is so thoroughly done that it works
well nonetheless.

One of the more interesting aspects of Little Blue Men is its
separation between goal and motivation. The character's goals are not
always clear; it is clear that the character does not anticipate the
ending of the game before it happens. Instead, the goals are more
personal, more centered on the self: your emotional balance is
somewhere between &quot;steamed&quot; and &quot;frosty,&quot; and your object at any given
moment is to become more frosty and eliminate those things that make
you steamed. Once the player accepts that premise--that your objective
is to get rid of annoyances--it drives the game, yet the author never
provides any goals larger than that. The result is, in a sense, a
rather narcissistic game--the importance of everything around lies in
how it makes you feel--which is, no doubt, just what the author
intended. One of the questions that Little Blue Men poses is whether
getting rid of those things that annoy you leads to anything better:
the ambivalent nature of the ending suggests otherwise.

In fact, one of the best, and most frustrating things, about the game
is the ending: the effect is both surreal and disturbing. It is not
clear that the player has &quot;won&quot; when he or she reaches the end of the
game; there is good reason, in fact, for thinking that the end of the
story is merely another ending, no better than the &quot;deaths&quot; you can
die earlier on.  This is a Zarfian ending taken a step further:
whereas other games have given a clear resolution without allowing the
player to &quot;win,&quot; in the sense of resolving the problem or riding into
the sunset with the treasure, Blue Men raises the distinct possibility
that it might have been better not to reach that ending at all. It's a
unique feeling that, unfortunately, doesn't necessarily make for a
satisfying game experience, assuming the player realizes what's going
on at all.

Indeed, Little Blue Men works somewhat better on the theoretical level
than as a game, though it's still a good game. The author seems to
have set out to demolish certain IF tropes, and, give him credit, he
does. Many of his points are sufficiently subtle that they're easily
missed--after all, not many games attempt such things. The game
itself, though funny in spots, doesn't work as well as the theory
behind it: the unclear or questionable motivations are part of it, but
it's also that the cross-genre feel keeps the player off balance,
wondering where the story will go next, for most of the game. Those
not interested in the theory of game design might well get to the end,
say &quot;what was THAT all about?&quot;, and quit. Still, perfect marriages
between entertainment and subversion/experimentation in IF are
rare--<a href = "s.html#spider">Spider and Web</a> comes close; not many others do--and Little Blue
Men does well to get the player through the game and raise some
intriguing questions.

This is, in short, an interesting effort, perhaps best suited for
those experienced in IF and willing to question its
conventions. There's lots of intriguing stuff going on in Little Blue
Men, enough that I gave it a 9 in this year's competition.

WARNING: Because Little Blue Men uses obscenities in its text, that
language will also appear in this review.

Well, the first thing I have to say is that starting Little Blue Men
right after finishing <a href = "h.html#human">Human Resources Stories</a> was quite
mind-bending. The game starts with a character who is sitting at his
desk thinking of his job as &quot;another day in the trenches,&quot; looking at
his corner as his &quot;own little slice of the shit pie those sons of
bitches call an office.&quot; I had this sudden vision of IF authors as
angry loners, driven by their misanthropy and lack of social skills
into highly solitary hobbies like writing and programming, friendless
misfits who hate their jobs, hate their lives, and generally hate
people, and who write supposedly entertaining games that are really
about how much the world sucks. Luckily, the vision passed as the game
underwent a curious transformation. First of all, the game's
disclaimer assured me that &quot;at its most fundamental level, this game
is about learning to love yourself.&quot; OK, maybe we're not loving
anybody else yet, but loving yourself is at least a little
positive. Next, I entered a few commands, the first ones that came to
mind, really, and... won the game. Or did I? My final message said
&quot;*** You have learned to love yourself ***&quot;, which is what I was told
the game was about. So I won, right? In 10 moves? I wondered how in
the heck a game whose .z5 file was 171K could end up being so short. I
wondered, in the game's words, &quot;What the hell...?!&quot;

It turns out that although LBM may be about learning to love yourself,
if you do the things that help you reach that goal too quickly you end
up missing the entire story. That story consists of scheming ways to
kill or otherwise waylay your co-workers, destroy the things that
aggravate you, discover the secrets hidden behind the bland office
walls, and figure out just who or *what* your boss, &quot;that bastard
Biedermeyer&quot;, really is. In short, it consists of getting an
unpleasant character to do unsavory things, in service of a plot that
grows more and more metaphorical and surreal as you progress through
it. When I finally got to the end, I wasn't sure that I was any more
satisfied with the &quot;real&quot; ending than the one I got to in 10 moves. In
his postscript, the author tells us that he wants the story's
structure to help us question to help us analyze some of our
assumptions about IF. For one thing, we should think about what really
is the most &quot;optimal&quot; ending of the game, and whether it's worth it to
actually play through a game if it's possible to reach a positive
ending at the beginning, and/or if the motivations of the character
are twisted and repugnant? Now, these are not new ideas. Andrew
Plotkin's <a href = "c.html#change">A Change In The Weather</a> offers a similar situation at its
outset -- if you rejoin the picnic, you end up having fun after all,
but you also miss the story. To go back earlier, Michael Berlyn used a
related technique in <a href = "i.html#infidel">Infidel</a> by making the main character a shallow,
exploitive greedhead who probably deserves a desert demise, then
asking you to solve puzzles and find treasure on his behalf. Little
Blue Men, though, makes these propositions starker than ever before by
making its main character thoroughly repulsive and an optimal ending
immediately reachable.

Now, my answer to this question in its abstract form is that responses
will vary depending on the player. Some people probably have no
interest in playing a repulsive character, and so will just delete the
game. Others might be driven by curiosity to complete the game even
though they find the experience unpleasant. Still others will view it
as a chance to get a glimpse into abnormal psychology, or to have some
fun playing a villainous character. In this way, playing such a game
is akin to watching a movie like Natural Born Killers, or reading a
book like In Cold Blood -- it may be very well-done, but it's not
everybody's cup of tea, and that's fine.  Consequently, I guess I
don't view the question as all that interesting, maybe because any
assumption I might have had about IF characters having to be good was
eliminated as soon as I finished Infidel (in 1986). But even though I
feel this way, LBM still didn't work for me, not because of its main
character but because of its choices of setting, imagery, and
metaphor. The game invokes the movie Jacob's Ladder a couple of times,
which is a movie I loved. That film was by turns profound, chilling,
and inspiring. LBM only achieves glimpses of these things, and I think
the reason is because I found its imagery muddled and incoherent. The
game is obviously taking place on some metaphorical level, but it was
never at all clear to me what the metaphors were supposed to be
representing, and as they stack up it only becomes more confusing. In
addition, there was basically no connection with reality, which left
the game's symbols floating unanchored. Some flashback scenes, some
glimpses of reality, *some* type of explanation for the heaven/hell
dichotomy the game presents would have gone a long way toward
connecting its symbolism with something more meaningful than just
other symbols. There's a lot to like about this game. It is written
well, and although it doesn't achieve an overall arc, it does contain
moments which can be quite moving or frightening.  Technically I could
find very little for which to fault it, both in its writing and its
coding. Its puzzles may have had some unpleasant content, but they
were clever and engaging, and generally quite well integrated with the
storyline. But for me, it did not succeed as a work of art.
Nonetheless, I respect it for being an ambitious but flawed experiment
-- I'll take that over competent repetition any day.

Rating: 6.3

I quite enjoyed this game, although it was a bit vulgar, but not too
vulgar. Basically it's about a guy in an office, trying to get though
the day, with out getting too stressed, by the job, and his
colleagues, and failing miserably. I would probably have given this
game first place. I got about half way through the game before I felt
the need for hints, and then went into hint-o-matic mode and totally
ruined the game, and gave up. I really don't think it's a very good
idea including on line hints, they're too tempting. Maybe people just
want to show off their programming skills. It's much better to have
easier puzzles that you can solve yourself, then you get the
satisfaction of completing the game, and if you do have complicated
puzzles make it difficult for people to obtain hints, so they give
them a go.

VERSION: 1.12

Say this for Adam Cadre: he doesn't repeat himself. There are darn few
substantive themes that tie any two of his games together, and even
those are pretty abstract (a dash of misanthropy and cruelty here, a
smidgen of mental instability there, etc.). Lock and Key, Adam's latest,
is very much a case in point: the gonzo humor and the queasy feeling
that you're not entirely aligned with the forces of light are familiar,
but the context, namely One Big Puzzle, is new in the Adam oeuvre. It
works quite well, though, particularly if you like that sort of thing
but even, to some extent, if you don't.

You're head of a security company hired to build a better dungeon for a
fairly unpleasant king -- the king's portrayal is largely comic with a
dash of brutality tossed in now and again. You arrange a series of traps
in the dungeon, then stand by and watch as an adventurer overcomes all
of them and lose your job and your head as he escapes. So you try it
again, and again, and again, eventually noting that different traps have
different effects, and at long last, after several dozen repetitions at
least, the adventurer's escape is foiled and you brag to the king that
no one escapes your dungeon (reminiscent of <a href = "v.html#varicella">Varicella</a>, of course, where
similar massive repetition was necessary; your character makes a comment
at the end about no one having the chance to go back and try it over
again).

Adam made a comment in his competition reviews this past year about
"participatory comedy" in <a href = "f.html#fine">Fine Tuned</a>, and Lock and Key strives for some
of the same thing. That is, some of the humor here derives from the
player's cluelesness, meaning unfamiliarity with the logistics of the
game. It turns out, for example, that you need to make a path into and
out of the dungeon in a specific way, but you have no way of knowing
what the game has in mind beforehand. Rather than dropping a message in
brackets along the lines of "[You need more doors, dummy.]," the puzzle
does its correcting through the game itself -- sometimes via a trusty
assistant who helpfully points out when you're being stupid, and
sometimes by actually letting you try out your defective dungeon (from
which the adventurer promptly escapes, of course). This is all very
well, and often it is funny, so I shouldn't complain too much -- but I'm
not sure I think it's a great concept (particularly when the mistakes
are beyond the reach of UNDO). It's actually not intrinsically different
from rooms-of-instant-death in <a href = "d.html#detect">Detective</a> and such -- i.e., stumble into
comical suboptimal ending because you have no idea what the game has
around the corner -- and while the writing here is good enough to make
the suboptimal endings amusing rather than simply a drag, not everyone
writes as well as Adam does. This is an idea, in short, that worked okay
for Adam because he actually got me to laugh along at my own/my
character's stupidity (and likewise for Dennis G. Jerz in Fine Tuned)
but the chances aren't that good that the next person to try it will
carry it off with the same flair. (And even so the
figure-out-how-the-world-works section of Lock and Key was not the
highlight.)

The puzzle -- hmmm. It works well, I suppose; there's a certain element
of "why does this work and not that? and why doesn't this affect that?,"
but some degree of that is inevitable and my logical objections were
few. What makes it hard is that the relevant hints are often dropped
relatively unobtrusively into the text, so it's easy to miss them -- all
the more so when you appear to be getting the same old failure message.
This is participatory comedy of another sort, I guess -- you've seen the
adventurer escape from your dungeon so many times that you no longer pay
attention to the details -- but it's not all that howlingly funny.
Still, it's a good puzzle on a lot of levels; it combines resource
allocation, logic, and detail-spotting in a way that goes well beyond
most IF. There are also a lot of technical tricks that serve the game
well -- there's a diagram of the puzzle that helps keep track of what's
where, and a record/replay command that lessens the tedium somewhat.

There are a lot of good puzzles on the IF archive, though, and I'm not
sure I would have kept this one on my hard drive if it hadn't been
written by Adam. There are lots of funny snippets, and some priceless
ones -- the sequence involving the gladiator whom you install in one of
the dungeon rooms to kill the adventurer, and who turns out to be a
long-lost friend, is funny enough in itself, but the adventurer's rage
at the king ("YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!") when the gladiator meets an
untimely demise is hilarious. A significant chunk of the gameplay is
there solely for humor value; for instance, you need to order each trap
individually, which means calling the trap's vendor (in a manner of
speaking). Think about the comic possibilities of deathtrap vendors
(each specializing in a particular kind of deathtrap) -- okay, humor
potential, but trust me, Adam appears to have thought about those
possibilities a LOT. Lots of familiar fantasy tropes -- evil king, mean
guards, etc. -- come in for their share of mockery, of course (vain and
impulsive king, bumbling guards), which isn't new in itself, but Adam
has given the mockery such breadth -- so many ways the guards can
bumble, so many funny lines for the king -- that it goes well beyond the
usual fantasy-parody tropes. As in Varicella (along with other Adam
efforts, but that one in particular), there's an element of misanthropy
to the humor; it's not gentle stuff. And here, as there, your character
is hardly an unequivocal force for good -- getting into the game means
acclimating to the role of aider-and-abetter of evil tyrant, though it's
an evil tyrant with funny one-liners. But for those who can wrap their
minds around the game's worldview, there's fun to be had outside the
puzzle-solving.

Lock and Key works well, in short -- it's not revolutionary, and those
who profess themselves unable to solve puzzles may find themselves
stumped -- but as a puzzle and as another line in Adam's list of
achievements, it's worth experiencing.

Lock & Key is set in a standard comedy fantasy world. You start out
without much back-story locked in a cell.

However, for the main part of this rather short game you are trying to
design a dungeon. You get a generous budget to buy traps and critters
with, and a map of the dungeon to place your deadly surprises on. This
is pretty cool. You also decide where the door in the dungeon shall be.

Designing a dungeon could have been very complicated, but quite some
effort has been made to make it easy, like the aforementioned map. There
are some problems; after the first time I tried it I found out there are
strict rules as to where the doors must be placed, so I had to start
over again. Also, some of the functions put into the game to make it
easier did not work as they should. So it is not perfect, but it is
pretty good.

Making the perfect dungeon is difficult, and one is clearly intended to
play the game many times and learn from one's mistakes. Playing through
the game is lots of fun at first, but gets a bit tedious after a while.
There are many hints that you are on the right track, but I think there
could have been more of them, or they could have been clearer, otherwise
you just have to guess what to do. 

When a player is supposed to play through a part of a game many times,
it might be a good idea to make this part as short as possible. There
are parts in Lock & Key where one can not do much, and I think most
players would have to play through these parts at least 10 times to
complete the game. The parts are not horribly long, and it is not a
terrible problem; you can just type z a lot, but still.

The game makes fun of clich&#233;s of fantasy in general, and specifically
fantasy computer games. The humour is OK.

All in all this is an original and good, but not great, game.

Errrrgh. 

I really, really wanted to like this game more than I did. It has a
fascinating storyline, evocative writing, and an uplifting theme. If the
author had turned the concept into a short story instead of an IF work,
it probably would have done very well. But despite all this, the best I
could give it was a 5: 10 for imagination, 0 for implementation. And
that was generous of me--I loved Lomalow's imagery so much that I
intentionally placed it a step above the other games that were crippled
by bad programming. 

Technically, Lomalow is poorly done--it abounds with sparsely
implemented objects (to the author's credit, there are few "you can't
see any such thing"'s), overuse of aliasing (where a bunch of related
objects point to the same game-object), one-syntax-only situations (one
of many examples: you can go "in" when you're by the cabin, but you
can't "enter cabin", "enter door", or "open door"), lack of synonyms,
and a few glaring bugs (particularly in the hint system--there's a
problem with object names showing up as numbers, making certain hints
distinctly unhelpful). Mimesis is shallow at best. Despite the many
conversational topics on the two NPC's, they ultimately feel like
cardboard, and this is a much more serious matter than it would be for a
puzzle-based game. Why don't they make any reaction when I just waltz
into their house ("hello"? "who are you"? "you look like you just fell
down a cliff"? :-])? Why are they missing some of the most obvious
conversation topics? (most grievously, "lomalow", "phoenix", "man", and
"woman") Why don't they respond when I give or show various important
objects to them (the book, the board, etc.), even though they respond
when I ask about the objects? And so forth. 

The gameworld overall feels sparse and thinly implemented--it takes more
than long, detailed room descriptions to bring an environment to life. I
can't interact with much of anything. I especially wanted to interact
with the strange forces/feelings in the pit, but couldn't find any way
to do so (I know it's not standard practice to implement "intangibles",
but I feel it's an extremely good idea in a game of this sort). Many of
the Inform default responses could use overriding (e.g., "So-and-so is
unimpressed" is almost never a good response to "show" in a story-based
game). 

The end result of all these little oversights, and the resulting
cardboardlike feeling of the npc's and the landscape, is that when I
reached the end of the game, my response was a resounding "huh?". Until
then, the characters had behaved almost robotically--reacting to nothing
but the magic word ASK, and occasionally moving around after I asked a
particular (predetermined) question. Then they suddenly came to life and
everything happened at once. The man accused me of thinking him crazy,
but I never did--there was never anything, other than a single
conversation response, to indicate that he was any more or less normal
than the woman. Except for the fact that the man moved around more and
the woman said "honey" a lot, they didn't seem all that different. Both
spoke in fragments, spoke only when prompted, and didn't do much of
anything else. Neither of them seemed very responsive or human until the
end. 

I know IF npc's are robots at base, but it's possible to create a very
convincing illusion that they are more. I've done it and I've seen it
done! It just takes a lot of work. Gamefile size is one reliable
indicator--if it's 80k, you've almost definitely not put in enough code
to create humanlike npc's. These are things that are only learned with
time and experience, and I understand that a lot of the competition
authors are novices (and should be encouraged!)--but it's hard for me
not to be demanding when a game aims this high and has such a neat
premise. 

The whole concept of using ASK--almost exclusively--to advance the
story, is questionable. The game doesn't need to have more puzzles, but
it needs more things to do. <a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a> is an excellent example of how to
immerse the player in a story without a single puzzle. And it needs a
better reason for why everything comes together when it does--one more
meaningful than "because you finished asking repeatedly about every
topic the author thought to implement". Ideally, it should be the player
who initiates those final scenes--as it is, it feels quite jarring and
unfair to be shouted at for something the game forced me to do! 

One final beef: When I read the introductory text from the author
(claiming that the only puzzle in the game was to "read all the text
that you possibly can"), and saw that the game had no scoring system, I
wondered whether it had a formal end. As it turns out, it did (an ending
well-worth reaching, despite the above criticism), but I got stymied for
a while when I reached a hint that said "if you can see this message,
you have already won". It gave no indication that I needed to go back to
the cabin, and since I had asked about all the topics I could possibly
think of, there was no impetus to do so. I didn't realize something huge
was going to happen as soon as I walked in the door! So I presumed that
was indeed the end, and I quit. Nagging uncertainty led me to dump all
the gametext via Ztools, at which point I discovered that I was wrong. I
would strongly recommend: 1. revising the introductory text to make
clear that the game has a goal and an end, and 2. adding a final hint,
unless you choose to follow the advice above and make the ending more
logical. 

I wouldn't be writing this long a review for "Lomalow" if I didn't have
such high hopes for it and its author, so I hope the criticism isn't too
disheartening. I would love to see a more fleshed-out version of this
game after the comp ends.

CHARACTERS: A little sketchy (1.0) PUZZLES: Some excellent (1.3)

OVERALL: 7.8

Stephen Granade's Losing Your Grip is an ambitious effort: the plot
draws heavily on symbolism and attempts to sustain it over the course
of a full-length game. The result, though the symbolic elements are
often a bit obscure, is consistently entertaining and
thought-provoking. Merely figuring out what's going on is, truth to
tell, challenge enough.

You play Terry, in rehab for nicotine addiction, and the game switches
back and forth between Terry's conscious mind in the rehab ward
and--well, it's hard to say, really. You move through a series of five
&quot;fits&quot; that deal with one aspect or another of Terry's mind or
experiences, both discovering and setting right (in some cases) the
neuroses and repressions of his life. This duality sometimes makes
things rather complicated: when the fits delve into Terry's past, the
game wants to present (in heavily symbolic terms) the events that have
stunted or altered Terry's development, but also provide you, the
player, a means of undoing those events (also in symbolic terms),
leading to some fairly tortured plot sequences. One fit depicts your
run-in with some &quot;faeries,&quot; a reasonably obvious stand-in for your
imaginative/creative side (at least, I thought so), and, in rapid
succession, the maturation of that imaginative self, its
disruption/negation by an outside force that threatens Terry's
freedom, and the overcoming of that outside force and reliberation of
the imagination. Whew. Bring a scorecard if you want to keep track of
the plot, because there's lots of it and it happens on several levels.

As a game, Deeper Meanings aside, Losing Your Grip is reasonably
successful--there are many challenging puzzles, and they make sense,
for the most part, in terms of the plot. There are, however, many and
varied ways to close off the game, including some &quot;planning ahead&quot;
measures that require considerable foresight. Notably, the way you
transport objects between fits, though clever and even logical on the
game's terms, requires that the player anticipate what the game is
trying to do--not at all likely within the first fit, when the
structure of the game still hasn't become clear. On two occasions,
choices you make send the game down one of two entirely separate paths
(which rejoin later), which enhances the game's replayability --and at
other times, there are multiple independent solutions to problems or
reactions to stimuli that shape what you make of your
character. Generally, these choices aren't between right and wrong as
such, though some have certain moral dimensions; they don't decide
whether the plot will continue, merely the nature of what
ensues. There is one section that devolves into sheer mathematical
puzzle-fest, not inconsistently with the plot but frustrating
nonetheless.

Perhaps the most successful part of Grip is the first fit, in which
Terry explores his own mind, thinly veiled as a majestic marble
building. Terry confronts his memories, allegorized into a pile of
spheres that a fellow named Frankie--Terry's powers of introspection,
perhaps--is engaged in counting and categorizing; the parallel to the
process that Terry is undergoing is clear and intriguing. Terry then
reactivates, reopens for examination, various areas of his life that
he had neglected, and deals with the resulting tide of guilt and anger
(in a way that violates the allegory a bit, but let's not get
picky)--and also manages to avert the complete breakdown (or death,
perhaps?) that had been expected. But the author is not so concerned
with hurling symbolism at us that he neglects to make sense of the
ostensible action, fortunately, and the individual scenes in Grip are
enjoyable simply for their playability and writing. But the depth of
the insight that Terry achieves--in realizing how the negative
emotions have tainted and darkened his memories, and how he needs to
open up long-closed areas of his mind--give the first fit remarkable
power. In that light, the limitedness of its effects on the remainder
of the plot--whether you succeed or fail at a certain task, most
importantly--feels analytically wrong; it seems like failing to get
Terry's emotional house in order should preclude further
introspection.  (As in, the plot continues on the same course and you
reach the same ending, which doesn't feel right.)

The ending of Grip, while logical enough, brings up a certain point,
not confined to this particular game but certainly relevant:
increasingly, rather than giving the player the magic McGuffin or
letting him ride into the sunset, authors end games on an ambiguous
note: there's a conclusion of sorts, but it's not an unmitigated
triumph, and there's no satisfying &quot;You have won.&quot; The Zarfian ending,
for want of a better term, is a welcome innovation, certainly--it
makes us think about what we've done--but please, all you Zarfians,
signify somehow that the player's _finished_ the thing, done all he or
she is supposed to do.(An &quot;afterword&quot; from the author, or an &quot;amusing&quot;
section, or something like that.)  Particularly in games like Grip,
where it's not at all hard to finish the game without earning all the
points, reading an ambiguous ending just convinced me that I'd missed
something and sent me back to solve puzzles that weren't meant to be
solved. Enhancing replay value is one thing, but confusing the player
about when enough is enough is another. (I should note, of course,
that Grip does have substantial replay value, in the separate paths
and in the intrigue of figuring out what everything means.  I just
wanted to know when I was done.)

Where was I? Oh, right. One of the nicest things about Grip is simply
that it hangs together well: the reappearances of the dark side that
you struggle with, the veiled conflict with Terry's father, and the
ways you drift back and forth between reality and memory/introspection
make a remarkably coherent whole, or so I found it. Once the player
picks up on the structure of the game (which takes a while) and the
significance of the recurring parts, the seemingly unrelated sequences
start to come together. Once I understood that the point of revisiting
past periods of Terry's life was to overcome the negative associations
he had attached to them, figuring out how to do it felt more
rewarding, though it's certainly possible to finish the scene without
thinking in those terms. Perhaps it was just that I appreciated and
agreed with the underlying message (or at least the philosophy behind
it), that Terry's anger at his father is misplaced and ultimately
destructive, but I found that, certain blips aside, the plot both made
sense and rewarded careful analysis--a rare combination. To that end,
though, I was a bit puzzled that an apparent choice between giving up
that anger and acting on it didn't affect the overall course of the
game--again, you end up in the same place with the same text.

I certainly don't claim to understand everything that the author was
driving at in Grip; there are many parts of the game whose
significance isn't clear to me, and may well remain that way. But I
enjoyed the parts of it that I thought I understood, and it kept me
interested enough to play through and think about in order to make
sense of the rest, no small feat for a full-length game. As both game
and story by symbolism, Losing Your Grip deserves praise.

URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/adrift/lost.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/adrift/lost.zip</a>
VERSION: First release

Making emotional content plausible in IF ain't easy. Getting a player to
feel what the protagonist is supposed to be feeling requires subtlety
(more than "you're feeling angry now"), good writing (at least, good
enough that the player doesn't notice it and get pulled out of the
flow), and, most of all, time -- a story that's long enough for the
player to settle into the protagonist's skin before any serious
emotion-imputing begins. Eric Mayer's Lost is a highly emotional game,
and while it does passably well on the first two counts, it's simply not
long enough, in my book, to achieve the desired effect.

It seems that the protagonist is upset about all manner of things,
primarily the decaying states of his marriage and his job, and he heads
for a walk in the woods. As he wanders and examines things, thoughts run
through his mind (in different colored text lest he miss their
significance), and the forest setting, while nicely rendered, is of
course merely a backdrop for the stuff going on in his head. He solves
one fairly simple puzzle (rendered more complicated only by the
unfriendliness of the ADRIFT parser), and a few sounds and apparitions
later, the protagonist has a choice of sorts. One of two different
endings ensues.

Not to belabor the point, but it must be belabored: the protagonist can
reach this ending point inside of 30 moves if he's pretty direct about
it, and isn't likely to take more than 60-70 even if he stops to smell
all the roses he can find. His ruminations about his past, however,
start right away and come relatively thick and fast. If you, the player,
don't decide to identify with the protagonist right away, you may just
miss your chance entirely. Now, there may be some for whom losing a
marriage and a job simultaneously strikes an instant chord of
recognition, and if you're one of those, I sympathize and recommend Lost
-- but the rest of us need some more prompting before we can identify
with the protagonist. Perhaps, with more exploration of his personality,
we might see ourselves, or someone we know, in this character. But the
protagonist's personality is almost wholly absent from Lost: we know
what he feels, but not who he is. As such, he had my sympathy, but I was
a spectator.

The backdrop, for what it's worth, is fine -- the woods are well
rendered, with attention to detail. There are some glitches in the
writing (e.g., "A few tough, spikes which used to be limbs, protrude"),
and the style tends toward the choppy ("Here and there grassy hillocks
are interspersed with dead trees. At the edge, cattails rattle in the
breeze. There is a wooden post here. The swamp is impassable."), but
there are some nice spots as well: "The lingering twilight floods the
top of the reentrant with a rusty glow." There are occasional fuzzy
pictures (which feel the need to reappear, necessitating window-closing,
every time you return to the location in question), which don't enhance
things much, but as a walk-in-the-woods game this is okay. (There are
occasional sidelights about orienteering, which could have used some
more explanation -- not everyone knows about orienteering, or even that
the term refers to a sport, if that's the right thing to call it -- but
as with publicity, there's almost no such thing as bad background
detail.)

When it comes to the internal strife, Lost isn't awful, but the game
doesn't exactly have the lightest touch. The principle of "show, don't
tell" is observed only haphazardly; one example, when examining a pine
tree:

   You're reminded of the fragrant, prickly needled Christmas trees you
   used to bring home. How long since you switched to the plastic one?
   You just snap the limbs on and spray it with pine scent. From a
   distance it looks alive. Not unlike you marriage.

Even aside from the "you marriage," the last sentence ruins what was, up
to then, a nice little aside -- it conveys the protagonist's
associations, and that's all it really has to do. The player can draw
the contrasts, given that much: it's not hard to put the "those were
happy times, unlike now" pieces together, nor are the
plastic-instead-of-real-tree dots difficult to connect. The paragraph
could easily have been stopped after four sentences, or three, or
(perhaps best of all) two. As it is, the last sentence seems to assume
the player isn't bright enough to draw any conclusions -- not wholly
unfair, as the player may be no more than five moves into the game at
that point (and no more than 25 moves from the end), but the answer to
that is more game, not signal-flare writing. Similar is this passage:

   Everything here seems still, sheltered from the wind, quiet. It seems
   to you a soothing place, beyond the reach of the world. Ridiculous of
   course, since the highway is a few minutes walk.

The first sentence is really all that's needed -- the second sentence,
setting out what the protagonist feels, can just as well be inferred,
and the player should know that the highway is within a few minutes'
walk if he or she's been paying attention. The author can clearly write
-- the writing here is always passable (typos and such aside) and
sometimes good. It's just that he often seems to write one or two
sentences too many.

Picky and grumpy, that's me, but I'd like to think there's a good reason
here. Writing IF whose success hinges on evoking emotion is a
hit-or-miss matter; if you don't succeed, you're likely to end up
sounding kind of mawkish. The player is tempted to snicker, which is
never a good thing. (A puzzle game that doesn't work may leave the
player frustrated or baffled, but usually not condescendingly amused.)
No one likes feeling manipulated, and the nature of the string-pulling
in Lost is such that it's easy to feel that way. And yet it seems to me
that all that really needs to change here (aside from some writing
stuff) is that the ratio of scenery/exploration to emotionalizing needs
to increase substantially -- there needs to be more going on, such that
the setting feels like a part of the game rather than an stimulus to get
the protagonist's mental wheels turning. Give me enough of it so that it
gets *my* mental wheels turning -- sufficiently so that you can tell the
story without spelling everything out so, er, blatantly -- and you'll
really have something.

Lost has its heart in the right place, but it's trying to accomplish
something very difficult while devoting minimal resources to the job.
Good try, say I, but not quite.

</a>
VERSION: 0.11

I'm not sure why I like The Lost Kingdom, Brainfuck Edition. Its parser is
crude in the extreme, and when you play it, you spend a lot of time mapping out
mazes. That's not exactly a recipe for success. However, within the modest
constraints of what this game tries to do, it is very well polished and
playable. It's also rather amazing from a technical point of view, and it comes
with an interesting backstory. For all of the above reasons, I think it's worth
a play.

The Lost Kingdom was originally entered into the 1st Annual 1 to 2K Classic
Text Adventure Competition, back in 2004. It took first place out of six games,
and the competition organizer, Paul Panks, called it "head and shoulders above
any game thus far!" This new edition of the game is not just a new port of the
game, but a considerable expansion of it. The new version has new features,
better descriptions, and one or two new puzzles, in addition to the distinction
of being written in an esoteric programming language.

Jon Ripley claims that this game is "probably the first ever piece of
interactive fiction written in an esoteric programming language and probably
one of the largest non-trivial Brainfuck programs ever written." Indeed, the
game is written in brainfuck, which does make it rather remarkable. Brainfuck
is an esoteric programming language, a fully functional language, but one that
is not at all designed to be practical, instead aiming only to be amusing to
programmers due to its extreme minimalism. In Brainfuck programs, there are a
maximum of eight commands, each of which are represented by a single character.
(For more information, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
</a>.) Thus, the
first line of the source code of The Lost Kingdom BFe looks like this...

   [-][.]&gt;+&lt;+[&gt;[&gt;[-]+&lt;-]&gt;[&lt;+&gt;&gt;[-]&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[-]+&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[-]&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;[&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;[

...and the remaining 29,000+ lines of code look rather similar. The code is
thus nearly inscrutable, and so it is not hard to figure out how brainfuck got
its name. Obviously, Jon Ripley found a way of machine-generating all this code,
but the game is still quite a piece of work from a technical point of view.

The parser in this game is more crude than any I've ever seen. In the game's
documentation, that author claims that a full-blown two-word parser might have
made the program run too slow on some computers, given the very sub-optimal
efficiency of brainfuck. As a result, Jon Ripley has set up a system where all
nouns are referred to not by a word, but by a number. Thus:

   You can see:
     a small wooden box of matches sitting on the table. (2)

To pick up the matches, type "take 2". At first this seems awkward and annoying,
but there is an advantage here. Every verb has a one-letter abbreviation, and
you can issue commands of no more than two characters. "t2" is an easier way of
picking up the matches. Once you get used to the verb abbreviations, the system
has a kind of simple elegance. Nobody will extol the game for giving you a
feeling of complete freedom -- you can't use more than 22 verbs -- but within
its constraints, it works well. By the way, it is worth noting that this
brainfuck edition of this game allows you to save, making it much preferable to
the version in the 2K Comp.

Likewise, the game's help menus are well-designed, as are the menus that
provide the backstory. Speaking of which, the backstory is another of the game'
s great virtues, one that is shared with the original version of The Lost
Kingdom. Although the game itself is very simple, even crude, it is surrounded
by a very interesting backstory that gives the story more depth. (And you
should definitely read the entire backstory if you want to win.) You can read
all this at Jon Ripley's web page for the game's 2K Comp version -- 
<a href="http:// jonripley.com/i-fiction/games/LostKingdom.html">http://jonripley.com/i-fiction/games/LostKingdom.html</a> -- or within the game itself,
by using the "!" command.

There is one other technically interesting aspect of The Lost Kingdom BFe. It
is actually two games in one. When you begin the game, you get a chance to play
it with either "short descriptions" or "long descriptions." The "short
descriptions" version closely resembles the original 2K Comp version of the
game, while the "long descriptions" version has much longer and more
atmospheric room descriptions, as well as one or two different puzzles.

That just leaves the game itself. Well, what can I say. You pick stuff up, you
manipulate the stuff with the 22 verbs, you wander into a cave, you map out a
couple of mazes, you defeat the bad guy (albeit a bad guy who is unusually well-
characterized in the game's backstory), that sort of thing. The game itself
says, "This game is intentionally written as a classic model text adventure
game." Either you can get into that, or you can't.

Anyway, in short, this game is pretty bad in some ways. In other ways, however,
it's very impressive. I recommend reading the backstory, and if that sounds
interesting, then this game is probably worth a play.

These time-traveling shoes
Are longing to stray
Right though the very heart of it
It's "Lost New York"

Sports aficionados say the mark of a good referee is that you never
notice him. He quietly and efficiently does his job controlling the game
without seeming to control the players. Lost New York (LNY) is that
referee. There's a definite air of professionalism throughout the work,
but you may not realize it until after the game. "You know, I don't
think the ref blew any major calls."

Interactive fiction players think one mark of a good game is when they
become absorbed by it. For this to happen, the world not only must feel
real but it must be engaging. Now, if you've ever been to New York City
(NYC), you know the smell isn't always a pleasant one. But, not only its
smells but by its whole atmosphere (good and bad), you KNOW where you
are. You're in New York, *&^%$! Remember, though, a game must do more
than capture the effect. It must do so in an interesting way. LNY
succeeds here too. You never get the feeling you're just walking down
each street for the sole purpose of realism. You never get the feeling
you are just a tourist. You are part of an unfolding story as well.

I love the rich history that permeates the game, often seeping into
strange but satisfying places. Your score is compared to a mayor of NYC
complete with a small biography. Excellent! This also ties in nicely to
the game in general. Even the better mayors were not without their flaws
and not without the sense that the city was so much bigger than they
were. You, the player, are thrust into the same situation. You control
some things, but the city largely has its own say, its own destiny.

I must point out that I am neither a patient person nor a master game
solver. Thus the complaints I do have about the game may be more
accurately pointed at my own flaws as a player. As a reader of the
newsgroups, though, I feel some of you may be in the same dock. With
this in mind, I think you'll get an idea of how to approach this game
based on your strengths and weaknesses.

The game can become unwinnable quite easily. For instance, I didn't
bring along a certain object because I had already taken the "important"
thing from it. Later on of course I needed to use that object for
something else. Restoring back so far was quite annoying. If you're the
sort of player who has an intuitive feel rather than an expert gamer
feel, you may find yourself in these kinds of traps too.

Near the end of the game I resorted to the walkthrough. I'm glad I did,
because I don't think I would have put everything together no matter how
long I had played. But I was able to solve 5/6 of the game on my own.
The puzzles and situations were generally very fair, although at one
point you will perform an action of questionable morals which is a
little out of character for the "average joe" player you are. (The rich
man in the park.)

Let me quickly finish the remaining other little nits. I had trouble
figuring out how to use the future subway. Also, the timing of a subway
encounter in another situation frustrated me. Every now and then I had
difficulty in communicating what I wanted to do. None of these remotely
resembled downright aggravation.

If you love detailed and responsive NPCs, you won't find them here.
However, this does not take anything away from the game. In the first
place, NYC is not the most congenial of places. There are no kindly but
knowledgeable grandmothers or entertaining yet clue-revealing minstrels
here. The thieves are definitely not gentlemanly. Also, LNY is a history
piece. You are dealing with the city as an evolving entity. The NPCs are
like little cogs in a bulky, inefficient, black box machine. They may or
may not have a minuscule role in city's existence and evolution. They
are important only to the degree that they can help you. This attitude
may hurt most games, but it works perfectly here. It fits.

Lost New York is an engaging work of interactive fiction and even a
standard on which all historical pieces should be judged. Bear in mind
that its whole is definitely greater than its parts. Each element taken
by itself is merely good. The overall effect is very pleasing.
Experience it for yourself!

LOST NEW YORK by Neil deMause sends the player character bouncing around
in time, from 1880 to 1905 to 1954 to 1780 to 2040. But none of these
dates has anywhere near as much effect on the shape of the game as its
year of publication: 1996.

For in 1996, the conventional wisdom asserted that the remaining
audience for text adventures was after just that: text adventures. Games
were essentially just series of puzzles, with the story as a backdrop,
the model world as set decoration. Yes, that backdrop and set decoration
could be and often was masterfully designed, but the idea that one could
create valid IF simply by building a model world for the player to poke
around in, or telling a story in which the player could participate,
only gained widespread acceptance over the subsequent five years, as
increasingly daring games placed less and less emphasis on puzzles and
were rewarded with plaudits from an audience that found it rather liked
that sort of thing. But in 1996, how the audience might respond was an
open question. Given the amount of effort that goes into a full-length
work of IF, most authors elected to go with the proven approach. LOST
NEW YORK is no exception. But while it follows the crowd, it does so
with obvious reluctance.

In the spirit of time travel, let's jump back about 400 years, to the
time of Shakespeare. But not our Shakespeare -- this Shakespeare lives
in an England where theater audiences are mad about juggling acts. Day
after day, the Globe is witness to trio after trio of balls, pins and
torches being flung into the air. But the audiences didn't want to see
*just* juggling; they wanted the juggling folded into a little story.
Enter Shakespeare, who soars to fame on the strength of "Romeo and
Juliet", in which a pair of young people fall in love at a masked ball
(the chief entertainment there: juggling), but then the boy's friend and
the girl's cousin get into a ill-fated juggling contest and it all goes
downhill from there. Now Shakespeare decides he might like to try
writing a history, perhaps something involving King Henry V... yes, a
piece tracing his evolution from carousing prince to the inspirational
leader of his countrymen in a great victory over the French. But he
can't just tell that story -- where's the juggling? If there's no
juggling, it's not a real play! So the first act ends up foregrounding a
bunch of jugglers at the bar while Falstaff and Prince Hal talk in the
background, and proceeds to the point where the jugglers accompanying
the army are told that the English have won the battle... and the
audience response is tepid because while the historical stuff is
interesting, the juggling isn't as accomplished as that in in RITO AND
IMITA. Shakespeare is left to mutter to himself about the constraints of
the medium.

Similarly, it's clear that in LOST NEW YORK, deMause's heart is in the
geographical and historical material. Virtually all the prose is
extremely deft, but never is the writing more alive, more joyous, than
when you die and the author gets to tell you another wacky story about a
long-dead mayor; never are the quips funnier than when they're playing
off the geography of the city (try going east from the City Hall area in
1880, or north into Hell's Kitchen later on.) The fact that the game
begins with a slideshow and ends with a bibliography is another
indication of where the author's interests lie. Hint: it's not in
fiddling around with hairpins and stopwatches.

But because this was written in 1996, the author felt obliged to fill it
with juggl-- I mean, puzzles. And these are mostly not very good, being
chiefly of the type where you're wandering around and find a fishing
pole, which you take because, well, it's implemented; later on you find
a stream, and go fishing because, well, that must be what the pole's
for; you catch a fish and, when you cut it open to cook it, a key falls
out. What was the key doing in the fish? Well, one of the conventions of
the genre at the time was that you weren't supposed to ask questions
like that. That's not actually a puzzle from LOST NEW YORK, but many
similar ones abound.

Of course, while the "take everything that's not nailed down, look under
and behind and inside everything that is" ethic works fine in a dungeon,
it gets to be a little absurd when transplanted to the island of
Manhattan. In LOST NEW YORK, Manhattan has like twelve things. And
that's too many. (Bet you thought I was going to go a different way with
that, huh?) Again, to avoid spoilers, I'll disguise the details a bit.
Let's say that the Upper West Side, circa 1965, has been reduced to a
single location with a mailbox in it. Now, the problem is *not* that
each street corner should be a separate location, nor that every item in
every store and every apartment should be implemented. As it stands, the
location works just fine as a representative area of the Upper West
Side, and the mailbox works just fine as a representative mailbox. BUT!
As soon as you fish around in the mailbox and pull out a live monkey
(which you then stuff into your knapsack) you are no longer dealing with
the Platonic Mailbox -- you're dealing with a specific, highly unusual
mailbox. And by extension, this is no longer just a representative
street corner: it's the particular street corner with the strange
monkey-containing mailbox. And once players lose the sense that the
locations they're visiting are representative, they're no longer
wandering around Manhattan; they're navigating a diorama of Manhattan
with twelve things in it.

But it didn't have to be this way. LOST NEW YORK is as much about the
New Yorks that might have been as the ones that actually have, and in
that spirit, I can't help but muse about what might have happened had
Neil deMause had his notes stolen one day in 1995. Disheartened, he puts
off the project for a few years, till his enthusiasm revives -- only now
the IF landscape is different. <a href = "m.html#amfv">A MIND FOREVER VOYAGING</a> is no longer a
low-selling oddball; *lots* of games now revolve around exploration
instead of dinking around with inventory. And so this alternate,
post-'96 version of LOST NEW YORK takes on a different shape. Instead of
players getting little more than a glimpse of New York's evolution,
whatever gets mentioned in passing as they're messing around with goats
and baseballs in curiously limited regions of the city, they can now
roam the entirety of the city freely, watching the different
neighborhoods evolve. Perhaps the interaction with figures who clearly
fascinate the author -- Robert Moses, Emma Goldman, the various mayors
-- is more substantial... leading to more New Yorks that might have
been, perhaps? A fully implemented Moses-free New York, say, or one
where Goldman's ideals took root... perhaps even a modern-day New
Amsterdam, if you diverge early enough. And hey, TADS has multimedia
now: why not throw some pictures into the mix?... oh, and...

...and at this point I've got the blueprints for a 21st-century
skyscraper and am waving them at the base of the Empire State Building.
The game has been written, and if deMause is anything like me, the idea
of revisiting a project that was long ago declared done is hardly an
appealing one...

...but hey, it's New York. If it were ever really finished, we wouldn't
have that old story about the visitor from Nebraska.

Uneven but reasonably enjoyable nonetheless, Neil Brown's Lost
Spellmaker pushes the boundaries of the genre somewhat. The setting is
ostensibly fantasy -- your mission is to rescue a wizard of sorts,
after all -- but Spellmaker is more comedy than fantasy; the game
spends more time subverting or mocking fantasy conventions than
abiding by them -- and to the extent that it succeeds, it does so
mostly because of the comedic factor.

You are a dwarf (an element almost entirely neglected by the story; it
isn't clear whether you're in a land of dwarves or are unique in that
respect) assigned by the Secret Service to hunt down a Magic Weaver
who has disappeared. (Some hint of the tone of the game comes in the
prologue, when you're instructed to retrieve the missing magician &quot;so
that he may entertain us further with his joyful sparkly spells.&quot;) You
have no hint of his whereabouts until you stumble across him; the
plot, typically, requires that you go out and solve puzzles, not
actually track the guy down. Still, there is more than enough whimsy
to keep the player entertained; among the better elements is a
sarcastic talking cow and a reverend who speaks entirely in
malapropisms. (&quot;I never did heard such inscruciating nonsenseness in
my whole lovely liveliness!&quot;) There is also some unintentional humor
-- one character's ability to parse input is limited enough to produce
this exchange:

     &gt;mrs wisher, hello

     &quot;Oh I'm sorry, dear,&quot; apologises Mrs Wisher. &quot;I can't do
     that. The Reverend wouldn't approve.&quot;

At least, I assume it was unintentional. The predominance of
silliness, as opposed to coherent plot, is occasionally irritating,
though -- one character must be given an object simply because it's
nonsensical, and your final action is more than a bit contrived.

The gameplay is slightly uneven; there are some actions whose syntax
might defeat the less persistent, notably the problem of a certain
well. At another point, in a dangerous situation, an escape route
opens up for a turn or so -- but the game gives you no hints to that
effect. More generally, you steal a jar from a sweet shop (well, you
take it in plain sight of a dimwitted salesman), and, as noted,
several actions are more than a bit illogical. There are several
well-coded features, though, notably characters who manage to move
around without obvious bugs (at least, not very many), a series of
candies that can be regenerated, and a hint system in the form of a
magical door that leads you back to the central office. Though the
game revolves around magic, your contact with it is limited -- one
instance -- and the story depends more on the silly characters in the
village than on the ostensible plot.

The central distinguishing feature of Lost Spellmaker is that you play
a lesbian; you are attracted to the cute librarian Tilly, and the game
tries -- not very successfully -- to resolve that along with the
finding-the-lost-magician bit. The author has said that the game was
underway before the argument this fall on gay characters in IF -- in
which his position was that a gay or lesbian main character, even if
made obvious, did not have to be a political statement. As far as that
goes, Lost Spellmaker demonstrates the truth of it; unless your biases
are such that you see the inclusion itself as political, this game
does not come across as trying to Make An Important Point or any such
thing. But nor does it do much with the relationship; your
interactions with Tilly are so limited that it would be hard to call
this a lesbian romance, somewhat improbable ending aside.

It is worth wondering whether such a game would feel like a political
statement if the game encouraged you to act in a way expressing your
attraction -- along the lines of, say, <a href = "p.html#plunder">Plundered Hearts</a>. As it is,
it's easy enough to forget that you're a lesbian -- for that matter,
to forget that you're female -- for most of the game. This is
certainly an interesting foray, but I'm not sure it answers many of
the questions that the argument brought up -- not that it was required
to, of course. With more development in the romance area, this might
be genuinely groundbreaking.

Lost Spellmaker is very short -- six puzzles, by my count -- and not
all that remarkable, but it does manage to entertain (me, anyway,
which is more than I can say for many humor games). As a demonstration
of the viability of having a gay or lesbian main character, it's not
particularly successful; it sends up the convention that the hero or
heroine must be a strapping young thing, but that's a different
problem. But it works well enough as a whimsical romp that I rated it
a 7 on the competition scale.

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag13.html">SPAG #13</a> -- February 5, 1998

It's not often that you see a thread from one of the newsgroups
translate so directly into an actual piece of IF, but that's what's
happened with The Lost Spellmaker. This summer, the discussion raged
(and I do think that's a fair characterization) in rgif about &quot;Gay
characters in IF.&quot; Some people held that if a piece of IF were to
feature a gay character, that piece would need to have homosexuality
as its primary concern. Others, including Neil James Brown, contended
that a character's sexual orientation can function simply as a vector
to deepen characterization, of no more central concern to the game's
theme than her gender, her height, or what food she likes to eat. The
Lost Spellmaker proves Brown's point quite handily.

The game's protagonist is Mattie, a dwarf Secret Service agent
dispatched to discover the whereabouts of Drew Tungshinach, last in a
long line of local spellmakers who have disappeared mysteriously. The
fact that Mattie is both a dwarf and a Secret Service agent is an
indication of the clever world that Brown has created, which consists
of equal parts Ian Fleming and Brothers Grimm. The fact that Mattie
loves candy comes in handy in a couple of puzzles, and helps explain
why she lives in the town Sweet Shop.  And finally, the fact that
Mattie is a lesbian has a bearing on the love-interest subplot with
the local librarian. Yet none of these incidental facts impinge on the
game's central concern, the rescue of its eponymous Lost
Spellmaker. Instead, they enrich our understanding of the characters,
for which purpose Mattie's status as a lesbian is no more or less
important than, for example, her status as a dwarf.

After the competition ended, Brown posted to RGIF that he didn't write
The Lost Spellmaker to prove his point -- the game was half-finished
when the debate began, and in fact he wrote &quot;It was unfortunate in
some ways that Lost was a competition entry, as I was unable to use it
as an example during the debate.&quot; No matter: The Lost Spellmaker
stands as an example now, proving Brown's point handily. It's also a
fun piece of IF apart from any political or identity
considerations. The quest for Drew brings Mattie in contact with a
number of amusing characters, and the milieu is small enough to make
most of the puzzles fairly easy. Of course, I can't deny that I
personally find it quite refreshing to play a game where
heterosexuality isn't the implied norm, but The Lost Spellmaker has
more than that to recommend it. It's a snappy quest in a creatively
conceived world, a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.

Prose: The prose in The Lost Spellmaker never jarred me out of the
story, and I often quite enjoyed reading it. The village wasn't
particularly vividly rendered, but the characters often were, and some
of the game's lighter touches were hilarious. Dialogue was, as a rule,
quite well-written, especially the Reverend's constant malapropisms,
which made me laugh out loud over and over, even when seeing them for
the second and third times.

Plot: Considering the weird, mutant setting Brown has achieved by
breeding traditional fantasy elements (magic, dwarves, talking
animals) with James Bond derivations (the Secret Service, a one-letter
superior, his secretary &quot;Mr. Cashpound&quot;), the plot walks a fine line,
and does it well. The plot is not simply a fantasy, though it does
involve using magic to halt the decline of magic, and manipulating
fantasy characters to solve puzzles.  Nor was it simply espionage,
though it did involve a heroic spy facing off against the obligatory
Femme Fatale. Instead, it swerved back and forth between the two,
making for a merry ride.

Puzzles: I only had to consult the walkthrough one time, for a puzzle
which was logical, but could have used an alternate solution. The
puzzles weren't the focus of the story, so they served the basic
purpose of small goals to help advance the plot. In this role, they
worked admirably well.  There were no particularly witty or clever
puzzles, but by the same token there were no unfair or
&quot;guess-the-verb&quot; puzzles either.

Technical:
writing -- I only noticed one proofing error in the game. The vast
majority of the prose was competently and correctly written.

coding -- There were a few bugs in the game, one of which may be more
of a library issue than a lack of attention on the part of the author.
Also, there were a few places where a response beyond the default
would have been appreciated. Overall, the code was relatively bug
free. Kudos must go here to the title page, which employed a really
nifty z-machine special effect.

Natasha Mirage definitely has the best nom de plume in Interactive
Fiction, but judging her game, Love's Fiery Imbroglio, by normal
standards is not entirely fair.  Although it is a &quot;text game&quot;, it is
not interactive fiction as we know it at all.  It is a computerized
version of a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book, and as a result, things
that would be considered to be bad form in a true I-F game (such as
choices that kill you or end the game without warning), may be
entirely appropriate here.

If you've played a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book, you already know
what this game is.  You get about a screen full story at which point
you are prompted to choose an action from a multiple choice list in
order to get to the next screen.  The story is primarily linear, with
a few side diversions, and has some choices which can end the game
completely, though you never actually die.

For example, early in the game when you are called for the date and
asked if 6:00 is okay, you can say that it is, say that it is too
early, or say that it is too late.  If you say that it is too early,
then the caller will get distracted, forget about you until it is too
late, and then spend the rest of his life in a monastary to atone for
his behavior, thus ending the game.  However, these are not nearly as
irritating as the &quot;Rooms of Instant Death&quot; in games like <a href = "d.html#detect">Detective</a> and
<a href = "e.html#electra">Electrabot</a> however because a) they are not entirely without warning;
common sense and textual clues may help you avoid many of them, and b)
the game has keys letting you back up any number of screens, meaning
that you don't need to restart the game or save first to get back to
where you were.  Just as in a real book, you can simply turn back to
the page where you were (and unlike a real book, you don't have to
remember what page number it was!)

The puzzles, such as they are, are primarily diplomatic ones.  For
example, at the restaurant, your gourmet date mentions being puzzled
by the secret ingredient of his favourite dish.  Suggesting that it
may be salt, will hurt his feelings by implying that he couldn't
identify something so simple.

As for the plot...well, the title tells you all you need to know.  It
is probably the only romance novel game apart from <a href = "p.html#plunder">Plundered
Hearts</a>. You are a lonely female, sitting around your apartment, trying
not to think about your accumulating laundry pile when a friend of a
friend calls and asks you for a date.  The game consists of getting
ready for the big evening, and handling yourself well during dinner
(no bad puns, please!)  A lot of the (supposedly) usual Romance novel
elements are in there; i.e. date has a secret pain which you must find
out about and help deal with.  Yes, the Schlock Factor does ride quite
high.

However, the writing is where this game really shines.  The repartee
between author and player is quite entertaining.  The game's
atmosphere seems to repeatedly switch between &quot;real&quot; reality, Romance
Novel reality, and fantasy in a very entertaining way.  The tone
manages to remain bouncy (ah ah ah, no jokes!  I'm not having things
getting silly!) and lighthearted at the appropriate times without
slipping into pure comedy.

Overall, this is a very polished and enjoyable product.  The simple
multiple-choice interface makes the parser completely trouble-free.
The writing (the core of any product like this) is first class.
Though I've never felt moved to read a Romance novel (and still
don't), I found the writing and interactivity, coupled with the
games's very reasonable length, to be adequate compensation for any
schlockiness, and considered the game to be well worth the time spent
playing it.

It's also not a bad introductory game.  I've always felt that intro
games should be much more heavily weighted towards story than puzzles
(as anyone who has played my own <a href = "t.html#tossed">Tossed Into Space</a> game can attest).
Furthermore, these days a good introductory game should not do things
merely better than graphics, but do things that graphic games cannot
do at all.  For example, imagine the climax of <a href = "#leather">Leather Goddesses of
Phobos</a> (okay, you can make a joke about that).  That isn't an
introductory game, but you get the idea.  That scene would be flatly
impossible to reproduce in a graphics game.  The same goes for this
game.  A person can't play it and say &quot;that was good, but I wish it
had been graphical rather than textual.&quot;  (Superfluous) graphics could
conceivably be added to this game, but could not possibly substitute
for the text.

The game was written with a system called Pinntale, which seems to be
specially designed for Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games, however I
don't know of any other games written with it.  I uploaded this one to
GMD myself about a year ago, and GMD has no others, nor does the
person that I got it from.

Recently the game was ported to AGT by Mike Ryan, where its title was
changed to &quot;Love's Fiery Rapture&quot; (to which I object, as &quot;Imbroglio&quot;
is a much cooler word and doesn't mean the same thing as rapture).
The source code for this version does exist at GMD.  The AGT version
is inferior to the original in that it does not let you customize the
character names, and does not seem to permit backwards page flipping
(although both of these things could be implemented using AGT).  It's
primary value is as a programming model for others wishing to create
this same type of adventure.

On the face of it, Love's Fiery Imbroglio is a game written
specifically for women.  In fact, you have to claim to be a woman at
the beginning or the game will tell you that you don't really want to
play it, and that it's all about knitting anyway.  But really it's
done well enough to be of interest to people of all sexes.

TITLE: Luminous Horizon

URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2004/glulx/eas3">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2004/glulx/eas3</a>
Directory contains game file, readme, and another directory containing a
virtual comic feelie which summarizes parts one and two.

When Paul O'Brian announced that he wouldn't be finishing his third
episode of <a href = "e.html#earth">Earth And Sky</a> in time for the 2003 competition, I was
slightly disappointed. Still, I knew that he would eventually finish.
Well, he did, and once again, won the competition. In short, that extra
year paid off. I said that part two was great, but part three is even
better!

One of the things that I wanted to see in part 3 was more team work.
Well, that wish was fulfilled beyond my wildest dreams. In this, the
final part of the story, you play both Emily and Austin Colborn. You can
freely switch between controlling one or the other at any time. In fact,
it is critical to do this in order to figure out which of them will have
the needed super-power to get past whatever is blocking the path. This
game is much more tightly timed than parts one or two. This is
especially true of the final battle, which is a desperate race against
the clock with little room for error. While the game has been designed
so that it can't be put into an unsolvable state, that doesn't mean you
won't meet a grisly end or fail to stop the bad guys. Most of the time,
learning by dying annoys me, but not in this game. It helped to build
the tension, and made me feel really proud of myself when I figured out
what to do to survive.

This final chapter in the story will bring the player face-to-face with
the enemies they learned about in part two, and there will be a few
surprises in store as well. Winning was a very satisfying experience
indeed.

More impressive than the battles and such, was the way Luminous Horizon
handles the switching between the two characters. Both Austin and Emily
are very well-developed in parts one and two, and the switches between
them help to reinforce the attitudes of each. For example, Austin is a
bit more level-headed than Emily, and there is both a little sibling
rivalry and affection between them. Austin calls Emily "Em" for short,
and she is occasionally annoyed at how Austin is somehow able to figure
out things that go right over her head. Here are a few examples of room
and object descriptions from each character's viewpoint. I've preceded
each with either "as Austin:" or "as Emily:" to denote which character
the player is in control of at the time of this description.

As Emily:

   High Plains
   You've never been much of a fan of Westerns, but this area just seems
   to cry out for some cowboy to mosey through it. Everything's here --
   the scrappy little bushes, the rocky ground, the mountains in the
   eastern distance, and the sense of barren desolation. All that's
   missing is a lonely ghost town and a tumbleweed slowly bouncing
   across the frame. The air seems unusually still here, as if the
   landscape were holding its breath in anticipation.

   A damaged road sign lies at your feet.

   Austin is nearby, apparently lost in thought.

As Austin:

   High Plains
   Scrub bushes and sparse grasses provide a little ground cover for the
   otherwise rocky, sandy soil of this area. Other than the jagged
   mountains looming a few miles to the east, this spot seems entirely
   barren.

   Emily is here, watching you.

   A damaged road sign lies at your feet.

As Emily:

   >x vehicle
   The vehicle (assuming Austin has guessed right about its function) is
   large and sleek, roughly rectangular in shape but tapering a bit at
   one end. Its entire surface is covered in a mazy tangle of pipes.
   Pipes wind around each other and down every side and edge, some
   terminating in a flare at the ground and others opening dark holes at
   the ship's untapered end. Except for the fact that its color scheme
   is muted greys and blacks, it looks rather like something that might
   have appeared in Yellow Submarine. No entrance is apparent anywhere.

As Austin:

   >x vehicle
   The vehicle is large and sleek, roughly rectangular in shape but
   tapering a bit at one end. Its entire surface is covered in a mazy
   tangle of pipes. Pipes wind around each other and down every side and
   edge, some terminating in a flare at the ground and others opening
   dark holes at the ship's untapered end. The whole thing looks a bit
   like an unfortunate collision between a shoebox and a French horn. No
   entrance is apparent anywhere.

As these examples make clear, I really enjoyed switching back and forth,
just to examine objects and rooms as each character.

Yet one more feature of this piece of IF is that it actually can show
the player one of several different introductions. At the beginning, you
can optionally answer some questions about how previous sessions with
the other two games in the series turned out, and the introduction will
be customized to reflect your answers. In short, nearly everything has
been thought of already and taken care of.

Lastly, like the previous two Earth And Sky games, this one is broken up
into sections. Each game has used a slightly different method of
dividing itself up. Part one used titles like "Suit Yourself," at the
start of each section. <a href = "a.html#eas2">Part 2</a> used quotes from Emily Dickinson which
were chosen to fit the situation. Part 3 gives the player a peek at what
the villain is up to at the start of each section. This is yet another
way of building the suspense up. Even before the game starts becoming
tightly timed, I felt like I had to hurry to stop the villain.

So, in short, I can't say enough good things about this game. It closes
out the trilogy in style, and shows that taking the extra time to polish
a game is well worth the effort.

There are two types of games in Interactive Fiction: those that are
puzzle-driven, and those that are story-driven. Luminous Horizon
definitely falls under the latter category, and if you're the kind of
player who enjoys that type I highly recommend this game. It is the
third and final episode of the Colborn siblings' attempt to find their
parents, a mission that has taken them from a quaint University town, to
the Sierra Nevadas, to outer space, and finally strands them in the
middle of nowhere, New Mexico. 

There are a number of good things about this game, one of which is that
you really don't need to have played the prior two installments of the
series in order to play and finish this game. But if you're going into
this game and want a good recap of the story so far, the web comic
feelie that accompanied the game does a great job of bringing you up to
speed without giving away any spoilers whatsoever. It's well written and
quite entertaining, two attributes that are prevalent throughout
O'Brian's works. I'd also like to give kudos to J. Robinson Wheeler for
his artwork. I'd recommend that you read the feelie even if you have
played the previous games - it just ties in so well with the style and
feel of the games. 

The included comic feels especially appropriate, as the characters in
this game could have come straight out of a graphic novel. The banter
and conversation that comes forth when Austin and Emily talk really make
one believe they are brother and sister. I might like to have seen a
little more sibling rivalry between the two, but considering that their
parents are missing I guess this pair of super heroes have had to put
other differences aside and learn to work together. While playing EAS3
you can choose to inhabit either sibling, a great feature and addition
from the previous games. This gives the player different perspectives on
the events taking place, and really allows one to combine the powers of
both the suits to defeat the forces of evil. Speaking of evil, I must
say that the villains are equally well written and nicely wicked.
Throughout the game the player is given glimpses of the pair, giving you
not only a nice feel of what you're up against but also clues at what
this devious duo is up to. This works well for the story; the occasional
clues keep the tension going and leads the player towards the inevitable
climax. 

Unfortunately, the competition release of EAS3 did contain a few
noticeable bugs. It's good to note though, that none of them render the
game into an unwinnable state and I hope the next release of the game
fixes some of the more obvious bugs. As for the puzzles within the game,
well... I did say before that this game falls under the heading of
story-driven IF. The puzzles are simplistic and are in the "find key,
unlock door" format. That is to say, they are not compounded or
intricate, and the author is clearly more focused on the storyline and
characters. And as for the previously mentioned climax, I must confess
and say I was disappointed when I reached it. I had hoped for more, and
found it easily overcome. 

The hint system in this game is in the format of talking to your sibling
in order to get the help needed to overcome the obstacle. An intuitive
move on the part of the author, but quite a leap from the previous
game's hint system which was a web-based series of questions. It makes
sense, if you think about it, to have your partner-in-crime-solving help
you out as you try to get past the puzzles. I must say though, compared
to the excellent hints from second game in the series I was dissatisfied
by the hints received from the finale. They aren't as helpful -- being
location based it's sometimes hard to know where you need to be focusing
your attention on -- and once you have heard the final hint from your
sibling there's no way to get them repeat themselves. It is therefore
possible to have yourself stuck somewhere, unsure of what to do, and
when you consult your hint source receive only "You've said all you can
think of to say at the moment". It can be quite frustrating at times. I
just felt that the format and quality of the hints from the second
installment were superior, and would hope that O'Brian would continue in
that fashion in his future games. 

Overall Luminous Horizon is a great way to pass the time and nice
conclusion to the saga started by Earth and Sky. While it might not be
the most challenging text adventure you're likely to come across, it is
still amusing and certainly has made its mark in the annals of
interactive fiction. If you're looking for a good challenge, however,
might I recommend that you bypass this game and move onto the runners-up
in the 2004 IF Comp: <a href = "b.html#blue">Blue Chairs</a> and <a href = "a.html#devours">All Things Devours</a>.

<A NAME="lurk"><h2>The Lurking Horror</h2>

Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag1.html">SPAG #1</a> -- May 15, 1994

NAME:  Lurking Horror           PARSER:  Infocom Standard
AUTHOR:  Dave Lebling           PLOT: Nice elements, but unconnected
EMAIL:  ???                     ATMOSPHERE: Captures the genre well
AVAILABILITY: LTOI 1            WRITING: Excellent
PUZZLES: Clever to puzzling     SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports
CHARACTERS: Lack Flair          DIFFICULTY: Medium

        Late one night, you, a student at G.U.E. Tech, have braved a blizzard
to get to the Computer Center to finish work on a paper.  However, the
simple assignment takes you to the horrific underside of the school. 
Lurking Horror's parser is, as expected, up to snuff.  The writing is
excellent; the game is firmly rooted in the Gothic horror used by Lovecraft
and Poe.  Dave Lebling has captured the essence of the genre well.  The
plot, however, is not as well developed.  It contains some nice elements,
but at times the disparate plot elements felt unconnected.  The characters
also lack flair.  The best of the NPCs are the different slimy creatures you
encounter, from a winged something to a slimy something.  Both the NPCs and
the plot could have been helped had the NPCs been obviously working
together.  The puzzles ranged from clever to puzzling.  There were a few
puzzles I didn't understand until I finished the game and looked in the hint
book.  My wildcard points were awarded on the basis of the game's atmosphere.
        The Lurking Horror is available in Activision's Lost Treasures of
Infocom 1 package.  While a worthy attempt to bring back the old Infocom
games, the repackaging removes much of Infocom's clever presentation.  The
Lurking Horror is mediumly difficult, and is especially good if you're a fan
of Gothic horror.

        In Lurking Horror, you assume the role of a college student 
who starts out trying to complete an assignment, and is caught up in an 
adventure of missing students, demonic Alchemy professors, and a showdown 
with the ultimate evil.  As you wonder about the tunnels and corridors of 
GUE Tech, you must deal with everything from sticky-fingered urchins to 
fierce rats.  The main strength of this game is the sense of atmosphere 
created.  The writing creates a sense of suspense and terror, and the 
player is enveloped in a frightening world of the macabre.  The only 
weakness that I found with Lurking Horror was the NPCs.  I feel that they 
could have been developed to a greater extent, especially the hacker.  I 
was also disappointed with the ending; it was a climactic let-down from 
what had been built up during the game.
        Besides this, though, it was a very good game.  The puzzles are 
interesting and not too difficult, and there is enough humor to keep the
player interested.  Lurking Horror can be found in LTOI 1.
