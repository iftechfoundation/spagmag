VERSION: Version 1

It's not the next chapter in The Chronicles of Narnia (and if no other reviewer 
makes the same joke, I'll be surprised). David Whyld's Spring Thing 2006 entry, 
written in Adrift, reprises the exploits of mercenary bad-ass Stavros "The 
Bulldog" McGrogan in a sequel to his earlier A Spot of Bother. It's up to The 
Bulldog to sneak, fight, grunt, and puzzle-solve his way to victory against the 
evil Warlord, Baron Grishtak.

At times, this is a contradiction. From the start, the goal is clear. I don't
mean the goal of the story (which is also clear), but the goal of the game 
itself. Finish the three primary objectives with full health for a score boost, 
and pick up more points for solving puzzles rather than pushing past them with 
brute force. This opens the game to a variety of play styles, but that "best 
score" objective is the carrot dangling just beyond reach. The Bulldog loses 
life points when he fights, and without a clear idea of how to gain them back 
(let alone how many can *be* regained), my inclination was to avoid fights and 
slink about the castle solving puzzles, preserving every point of health 
possible. So much for being a bad-ass.

Even though I enjoyed the game using this strategy, I might have enjoyed it 
more if I hadn't been aiming for a perfect game. In the end, it didn't matter. 
I didn't complete one of the three objectives, and I won with a score of only 
80 and health of 90. The ending - and the death ending too, when I purposely 
let The Bulldog get pounced by The Tiger - was still satisfying.

Things take a bit longer when you play for points. Instead of beating up the 
bad guys, I lured them into traps, tricked them into leaving, or simply avoided 
them entirely. When I stumbled into traps or lost health in unexpected ways, I 
opted to "undo" or "load" a prior save, so I could try another approach. This 
made the game tougher. To get it all right the first time, I would have needed 
to read the author's mind. The interesting thing is that this was just another 
way of playing the game. With a different objective - let The Bulldog fight 
enemies and bully his way past the tough parts - it doesn't require psychic 
powers. It's a fair system which rewards do-overs without making do-overs 
essential to win.

I've mentioned "health points" several times. If you have visions of RPG stats 
and random dice-rolls - especially if you don't *like* those things - take 
heart. That's not how WPB works. Think of it as the antithesis of a scoring 
system. When you earn "score" points, it's for completing a task, reaching a 
milestone, or hitting some score-worthy trigger. These are things built into the 
game, and the points are set. If you play much IF, you've probably seen this in 
action. WPB has this *in addition to* its health point system. Points come off 
by making mistakes, or in other predetermined ways that involve alternate puzzle 
solutions. Sometimes, these mistakes (especially in facing enemies) can be 
repeated, but on the whole it's more like a credit system. The Bulldog is 
extended so many of these "mistake" points, and he spends them as necessary.

The beauty is that making these mistakes usually gets The Bulldog past puzzles. 
For instance, there are several ways to pass the landmines near the beginning of 
the game. One way in particular saves The Bulldog from damage entirely. Other 
ways leave him only slightly scathed (or perhaps unharmed, but with the loss of 
something that might be the key to avoiding damage later). Of course, stepping 
into it (with persistence) solves the puzzle too, at the expense of a chunk of 
health.

It's designed to be winnable, no matter how low your health becomes. The more 
damage The Bulldog takes, though, the fewer risks he can endure. Suppose this 
drops to a single remaining point. The game remains winnable, but every 
additional obstacle must be overcome with brains instead of brawn. This can 
become *very* difficult. Health can be recovered, but I never was quite sure 
how much. If I recall, I healed about 30. The Bulldog has suffered some prior 
to the start of the game, beginning with 63 health. Health of 100 is considered 
"full". It may be possible to recover more than 37, making it possible to take 
damage and still finish with full health. I never figured out the max. It's just 
as possible that every method in the game adds up only to a total of 37, meaning 
a perfect win requires a totally unharmed Bulldog. Maybe a better player than I 
- or Whyld himself - will say for sure.

Really, it's a clever design. I can't think of a single puzzle that didn't 
have two or more solutions. The easier the solution, the fewer the points (and 
often, the more damage The Bulldog would take). Because my goal had me going 
after the toughest of each solution, I hit the built-in help often. After only 
a short ways into the game, I was requesting every hint available in every 
room. In a way, this became just another tool, like "undo". Instead of cheating, 
it seemed more like a part of the game. Some hints even felt more like puzzles 
to solve. Even *with* hints, it was often difficult to work out the best (most 
rewarding point-wise) solutions. Without them, though, I never would have.

This all makes it difficult to say just how tough The Warlord, The Princess, and 
The Bulldog is. I solved many of the puzzles with easier solutions at first, 
costing The Bulldog only a few points of health. I would have finished faster - 
and possibly without so much reliance on hints - if I had just pressed forward 
from those points. I suppose it ranges from "challenging but not overly 
difficult" to "one step down from impossible", depending on what approach you 
take. Mine was more on the side of the latter.

Whyld has done an excellent job of anticipating much of what players may try. 
The implementation level alone is amazing. Very little encountered in the game 
lacks first, second, even third-level implementation. If you look at scenery 
that has parts, you can look at those parts. You can often *interact* with those 
parts. If those parts have parts, they're probably implemented too. It pays to 
really inspect what's around. Even though much of it is optional, enough digging 
can bring up the keys to alternate puzzle solutions.

The prose in WPB is dotted with amusing passages. Generally, Whyld isn't trying 
for real comedy - and if so, it probably wouldn't have worked here anyway. It's 
more the "ah ha, that was funny" kind of subdued but cliched humor you'd expect 
from a story in which the hero only grunts yet everybody understands what he 
means. When Baron Grishtak writes a letter to his ace henchman - subsequently 
obtained by The Bulldog - he admits that he "foolishly jotted down the access 
code to the master computer on the bottom of it." He goes on to encourage his 
henchman to destroy the letter after reading it, for that very reason.

As to the presentation, the author held nothing back. My first fifteen minutes 
were spent just reading the introductory material - details about the game, 
additional commands, the intro, etc. The game font size can be adjusted via the 
command prompt. Screen-clearing at each room change can be turned on or off 
(personally, I liked it on - it was easier to quickly scroll up and reread room 
descriptions that way). Around four different fonts were used - one for room 
headers, one for the room description, the default font for most game messages, 
and a script-style font for letters and notes. It may sound like a hodgepodge, 
but it works well (if you're using the Adrift runner and your Windows-based 
computer has those fonts) and it set WPB apart from other games in terms of 
style.

To now, it may seem as though I have no complaints about The Warlord, The 
Princess & The Bulldog. A big game, though, has more room for things to go 
wrong. None of these problems (in my play-through, anyway), were game-killing, 
but they ranged from mildly annoying to completely preventing (or, at times, 
*allowing*) certain solutions. My transcripts note quite a few typos - not 
surprising in a game of this size and complexity, but still minor dents in the 
proverbial finish. Weirder quirks included things like the non-working pendant 
(it worked once, but after a subsequent "undo" or "restore", shaking it didn't 
work even though it still had 3 charges); being able to enter the guards' 
training courtyard in a "they're gone" state, even though they shouldn't have 
been; a reference to a voodoo doll in the hints, which doesn't seem to be in the 
game (Adrift will usually respond to objects it knows, even in other places, and 
it didn't know that one); being able to break the panel in the sleeping quarters 
repeatedly; I didn't realize it at the time, but the "code to the master 
computer" is too long to work in either of the computers found later in the 
game; some available exits were unmarked on the map; some exits described in the 
text didn't work in the game; you can't "undo" to before a hint screen; I 
couldn't get "exit" to work (even though it was supposed to), when trying one of 
the codes; A seven-letter password scattered throughout the castle appears to 
have two fifth letters; it's possible to set the watch before winning, so that 
it goes off during the final scene; a few other miscellaneous quirks.

As the game progressed, these things either became more common or more 
noticeable. Maybe it was the cumulative effect, but my faith in the game's 
internal consistency was shaken. If I felt at all guilty about reliance on 
hints, the feeling passed when I thought that maybe the game was broken just 
enough to *prevent* the solutions I needed for a perfect win. This may not be 
true. From my experience, the bugs that persist after beta testing are usually 
the bugs in sections that *aren't* vital - else they would have been worked out 
already. Nonetheless, it's a reminder: the better the polish, the higher the 
faith.

Most of the design works great. The health point system contributes to alternate 
puzzle solutions, and alternate puzzle solutions are abundant. The hints, 
although cryptic at times, are helpful. Even so, a few specific parts left me 
cold. One very early puzzle (the one that avoids a loss of health - an easier 
but damaging alternate does exist) requires waiting a few turns after taking 
action. I was impressed that the game allowed the particular action, but I 
thought I had messed up - so I did an "undo". Speaking of "undo", you can 
unwittingly make a move that disables it, in what I can only describe as a prank 
perpetrated by the author. It's by no means a necessary (or even an obvious) 
move, but some players will try it. I found no way to re-enable it, aside from 
reverting to a prior save (or starting over). One obstacle requires that you 
lose everything in inventory. The hints describe a way to keep most of it, but 
it requires repeating an action (and it's even possible to undo a failure, 
repeat, and succeed the second or third time).

As a Spring Thing entry, WPB is fittingly sized. My play-through - taking most 
puzzles the hard way and relying heavily on the built-in hints - was eight and 
a half hours. Despite the flaws, I enjoyed the time I spent with The Warlord, 
The Princess & The Bulldog. An incredible amount of effort was put into this 
game, and it really shows. A post-competition release could address the 
remaining problems, making it even more recommendable.

My Spring Thing score: "9"

     &lt;<A HREF="https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/tads/">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/programming/tads/</A>&gt;

While driving home from work at night your car's engine dies.  Stopping at
the side of the road you get out to investigate (not because you have the
slightest clue of what the problem is, but rather because that seems the
thing to do).  Moments later you are engulfed in blue light and pass out,
awakening once more in a dungeon-like cell.

The introduction to &quot;Waystation&quot; can be seen as analogous to the game as a
whole-- rarely do you have a reason for your actions, other than that they
seem like the right thing to do at the time-- objects are collected simply
because they can be, and used by the same rationale.

Your goal in the game is not revealed until over half-way through, so for
the majority of the game you are reduced to moving purposelessly from
location to location and solving seemingly arbitrary puzzles.  It could be
argued that you are exploring the environment, but the game-world is not rich
or coherent enough for this to be a satisfactory explanation.  Indeed, the
game is a mish-mash of genres-- Granade has played with many ideas, but
expanded on almost none of them. The introduction suggests alien abduction,
but then you are transported to an all-too-human cell and seemingly left to
rot there; after your escape you fetch up in an Orwellian world of barcoded
and overalled workers, repressive armed guards, and unquestioning order;
later, by way of the waystations of the title (interplanetary teleportation
booths), you visit a garbage-dump planet, and a decaying, war-torn alien city
(in which you find a Roman Catholic church untouched by the bombs which
decimated the rest of the city-- shades of H.G. Wells' &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;?).
This hotch-potch of genres overflows into the local geography in places.  For
example, one building contains the worker's bathroom, the cafeteria, a
strange museum-cum-library, an armoury, and a rather sensitive computer room
all along the same corridor.

The writing is quite good, the location decriptions are vivid and all the
text is clear in it's meaning.  However, a somewhat juvenile humour pervades
the game, with the produce of the worker's cafeteria likened to school
dinners and the not uncommon trap thrown in which unfairly kills the player
after luring him into considering it a puzzle (the most obvious example being
the slightly infamous exploding toilet &quot;puzzle&quot; early on in the game). 
Equally, the solutions to some puzzles verge on the ridiculous (passing the
laser beams) or are only apparent with foreknowledge gained through previous
failure (protecting yourself from the acid rain, escaping the ruined house,
or using the viscous liquid).  Also, there are a lot of red herrings, both
portable objects and referrable-to, but useless, scenery objects.  Used
sparingly and carefully such red herrings can contribute to a game's
atmosphere and &quot;realism,&quot; but here they generally do neither, and the lack of
a satisfactory container (such as, say, &quot;<A HREF="c.html#curses">Curses</A>&quot; rucksack) results in the
need for annoying inventory management.

In summary, though the game is not wholly disappointing, neither is it
particularly gratifying or inspired.  If you do not expect too much from it,
in the way of a strong or developed plot, or detailed interactive NPCs (there
are none) the game succeeds reasonably well as just that-- a game.  The
puzzles, many of which seem to exist for their own sake only, as I've
mentioned before, are generally of medium difficulty, and do not noticeably
differ in this respect throughout the game.  Overall &quot;Waystation&quot; is a fun
game, which perhaps offers as many lessons in how not to write IF as it does
in how to write it.

AVAILABILITY: Freeware

VERSION: Release 1

Surprisingly, the game's subtitle, "an Interactive Misdirection", is
true enough. But this game offers additional err... misdirection. Well,
the problem is -- you don't know who you really are until the very end.
But that's the main idea (or call it the feature) of the game.

"The Weapon" is strongly related to the outstanding game <a href = "s.html#spider">"Spider and
Web"</a> by Andrew Plotkin. Both games are heavily puzzle-oriented, but more
than that -- they both have a lot of gadgetry in their puzzles, and you
must work out how to use that gadgetry. I'm happy to add that the
puzzles exist not just for sake of themselves -- they are based on the
plot.

In addition, both games' PCs know more than the player; you must explore
not only surrounding world, but also yourself. Or at least you must care
about what PC says. But there is a problem in "The Weapon" -- to follow
the hints that reveal the PC, you must pay close attention to those
hints. Strangely, the puzzles distract you from that, and I personally
was not able to identify myself with the PC, because it was not far
enough from a simple, boring cardboard stereotype. That's OK in most IF
games, those with simple plots or those that are puzzle based (take <a href = "m.html#mulldoon">"The
Mulldoon Legacy"</a> by Jon Ingold for example), but, as I noted above,
after all "The Weapon" is a story with heavy plot, based on puzzles and
self-discovery.

"The Weapon" features the "most appropriate" conversation system: you
type "talk" (or just "t") and the PC considers the current situation and
says (in fact, more often just replies) what he/she thinks the most
appropriate answer is. Ian Finley (and before that Adam Cadre in
<a href = "s.html#shrapnel">"Shrapnel"</a>) used this very technique in his game <a href = "k.html#kaged">"Kaged"</a>. I found the
effect weak then, but unlike "Kaged", in "The Weapon" there are several
reasons why the author chose to use this conversation system. First, I
think it's impossible (or very hard) to explain to the player "what's
going on" in the game, since the PC is so far ahead of the player right
from the start. Well, there _are_ alternative ways to show what's going
on, but I don't think that cut-scenes or self-dialogues are more elegant
methods for expressing the PC's thoughts. Second, as the author said,
"you never need to TALK to win the game", but you need to in order to
understand the story. Third, you can ask NPCs for things and order them
to do things in the usual way, i.e. "Cheryl, open the door" or "ask Tom
for a knife". Fourth, the PC's remarks are quite terse and seldom go
very far from the NPC's questions -- and that lessens the "PC commands
player" effect.

Puzzles in the game are logical and mostly fair. But -- you can't solve
some of them without seeing the death messages first. That's not very
good, but with modern "UNDO" techniques you can reach the end of the
game without much trouble. Overall, the majority of the puzzles are
quite easy, because you can't do a lot in any particular moment of time,
and that's good -- I was able to concentrate on the current puzzle for a
long time. But there are no red herrings (well, the scenery "window"
doesn't count), and I think that's bad -- red herrings add not only
challenge for the player, but also a time to think about the situation
aside from its puzzles. On the other hand, all the puzzles are well
thought-out and sufficiently beta-tested. There are a lot of messages
for the wrong moves of puzzle solving, and no technical bugs, as far as
I can tell.

To help you in puzzle solving, the author has added built-in hints. They
consist of many levels (i.e. each puzzle has about 15 hints) and are
well thought-out. But not everyone loves built-in hints -- they are far
too easily accessible (I mean, you don't need even to connect to
Internet) to prevent their use.

There is only one NPC in "The Weapon", I think. But as in "Spider and
Web", she is your enemy and you're trying to outsmart her. The NPC is
fairly well implemented, but has little dynamism. She is not cardboard,
but you can easily confuse her with it.

The writing in the game was not easy for my lame English (I hope you
don't forget that I'm Russian.) -- it was too heavy and had a lot of
specific to science words. I was able to fully understand the story only
after my fourth time reading one particular sentence -- a really rare
situation for me. My English is lame, as I said -- let it not distract
you from the game. But do note that.

Also, the game supplies a newspaper -- the usual newspaper that
describes recent news [events]. It helps to set the mood for the game.

Overall, "The Weapon" is well implemented and has some good puzzles, but
it is not _long_ enough to suck players into the game, I fear. The story
is good and made me think about it after I finished the game.

I almost forgot to say: "The Weapon" is a one room game. It is placed in
the very far future and centers around the space war (or around post war
events) with aliens (there are no laughs, it's serious). Not that this
plot was never implemented before, but it's not bad for such a short
story. This game is worth a look.

SCORE: 
Atmosphere: 1.3 (not enough mind sucking)
Game-play: 1.6 (mostly fair, but nothing outstanding)
Writing: 1.2 (good, but not great -- for me)
Plot: 1.3 (quite novel, but short)
Wildcard: 1.4 (for gadgetry oriented puzzles; sci-fi story)
Total: 6.8 (not bad)

I don't think a definitive taxonomy of IF puzzles has been written, but
there have been gestures in that direction, and one of the better ones
is in the recently released fourth edition of the Inform Designer's
Manual. Graham Nelson doesn't so much describe the essence of good
puzzles -- for the sensible reason, I suspect, that there's no unifying
thread that distinguishes good puzzles -- as point out some of the more
tiresome themes in puzzle creation (as well as some underexplored puzzle
models). The themes are instantly recognizable to the seasoned IF
player: Get-X-Use-X, locked-door (including variants involving guardians
who want a particular object), maze, light-source,
capacity-and-exhaustion, etc. It's probably an oversimplification to say
that good puzzles are those that don't fit into the familiar categories,
but I do think it's true that, for a puzzle to be genuinely memorable,
it either needs to be outside the canon altogether or be a truly novel
spin on the usual patterns. The puzzles in The Weapon are of both
varieties, and for that reason they're, for the most part, satisfying to
solve.

You're in the middle of a war against an alien race, with a third race
peripherally involved, and you're helping a superior officer figure out
how to use a mysterious weapon -- except "helping" isn't quite the word,
because you're interested in figuring out the weapon but not entirely
interested in enabling the officer to succeed. Accordingly, the task is
both to decipher the gadgetry and to mislead and misdirect the officer
looking over your shoulder. Gadgetry-deciphering is a pretty familiar
puzzle trope, but not with this sort of spin -- and, better, the tricks
you come up with make sense, for the most part, and change to fit the
situation. The gadgetry itself isn't particularly exciting, really, but
the nature of the challenge demands some creative thinking -- how do you
vary the tricks and misdirections to avoid going to the same well too
many times, for instance?

There are a few flies in the ointment. The puzzles aren't easy, and
while for the most part they're logical, they also depend to some extent
on visualization of things that aren't quite as well described as they
could be. In other words, the puzzles make perfect sense if you
visualize some key objects the way the author does -- but you might not,
and the descriptions are a little too sparse to clue you in that you
should be seeing the objects in question another way. There's a
comprehensive hint system, to be sure, which helps fill in the gaps, but
it's something of a drag to wrestle with puzzles and find, when you give
up, that the solution was something that never crossed your mind because
you "saw" the scene the wrong way. Another puzzle, while reasonably
logical, suffers from guess-the-verb problems, and in several cases the
game doesn't acknowledge guesses that are on the right track. These
aren't mortal sins, though, and I'm willing to put up with some design
flaws for the sake of some original ideas.

The main NPC -- the officer -- is also well rendered; most of the
puzzles hinge on observing her behavior or guessing at her reactions,
and for the most part she functions logically. The relationship between
the protagonist and the NPC isn't quite as well described and leaves a
lot of questions unanswered -- why does the officer choose someone whom
she clearly doesn't trust? Why does she seem to trust you at some times
-- letting seemingly interesting developments pass with no comment --
but not at others? Still, most of the problems are relatively minor, and
a little imagination can fill in the gaps, I suppose. There's also an
interesting twist at one point that forces the player to reassess
everything that's come before -- though the twist might have worked
better if another recent game hadn't done something extremely similar.

The best way to describe The Weapon, I think, is that the seams don't
often show: library responses are rare, descriptions and logical
responses are in ample supply, and most aspects of the game appear to
have been thought through, quibbles about visualization aside. The
HTMLized feelies enhance the feeling of professionalism, though there
isn't a lot to them; they're not as slickly done as Infocom's feelies,
but they're well designed and suggest that the author took more than the
usual pains to set the scene. The puzzles may not be everyone's cup of
tea, but on the whole it's likely that the player will be reacting to
the puzzles themselves (and to the concept), not to inadequate
implementation thereof. Admittedly, it's not a long game -- four
puzzles, by my count, and I did find some flaws even in those four
puzzles -- but the flaws aren't fundamental tragic flaws, and many
probably wouldn't consider them flaws at all (or wouldn't encounter the
same problems). The writing, similarly, is unspectacular but effective
-- it's strictly functional, doesn't try for splashy effects or clever
dialogue, and never gets in the way of the game. The experience is
rarely spectacular but almost never outright disappointing.

The Weapon is intelligently done, and done with care; it may not set the
IF world on fire, but it doesn't do much wrong.

Last but not least.

I'm torn with this one.  Using the changing hand as a marker for the
player's progress is very imaginitive, but this doesn't quite mask the
game's overall linearity.  Still, there are enough red herrings to keep
it from being immediately apparent, and there is a nice re-use of
puzzles, building on the previous challenges, particularly with the
enchanted coat.

The author comments that the claw was inspired by the desire to create a
game without a scoring system, as he feels scores make I-F feel too much
like a game rather than a story.  I'm not sure I agree entirely with the
author's intentions here.  I personally use the score as a means of
reassuring myself that I haven't just botched the game entirely (though
of course it's not 100% effective).  The truth is, nearly every game I've
seen to date has an optimum ending, the &quot;real&quot; ending to the game that
closes the story as the author sees best.  Scoring is the easiest of a
very few ways to let the player know when that ending has been reached.
If a game is designed in such a way as to allow plotting without score,
that's wonderful, but otherwise I don't think I-F should be penalized
for failing to comply with this standard.  A lot of games use the
scoring system effectively, even artistically.

I sort of got off track there, didn't I?  Well, it'll give us something
more to debate.  Overall, &quot;Wearing the Claw&quot; is a nice
middle-of-the-road entry.

One of the nice things about fantasy IF is that it's so malleable; rarely
will the player complain that he couldn't suspend his disbelief enough to
allow the author's innovation to work, because just about anything goes.
As such, the fantasy setting serves Paul O'Brian's Wearing the Claw well,
as it allows the author to incorporate some interesting experiments with
the feel of traditional IF--and while the result isn't flawless, it's
certainly good enough to be worth a look.

The main innovation at issue is the replacement of the traditional
point-based scoring system with something that actually relates to the
plot. Specifically: your mission is to rid your homeland of a curse that
has turned people's body parts into animal parts, and your own left hand
has turned into a wolf's paw. As you overcome significant obstacles in
your quest, however, your hand turns more and more human (and, conversely,
when you screw up or otherwise get farther away from your goal, the
wolfish part of you grows). The changes, one way or the other, are marked
by a &quot;tingling&quot; or an &quot;itching&quot; in your hand, and the effect--to keep the
player on course without the artificiality of points as a reward--is
accomplished nicely. There was one time, however, when my hand became more
wolflike even though I had just made progress toward my goal--but it's a
minor flaw in a well-conceived experiment. It's true that, since the game
was released, other IF has been released with more dramatic revisions of
the standard scoring system--<a href = "s.html#sunset">Sunset over Savannah</a>, <a href = "l.html#little">Little Blue Men</a>--and
still other games have abolished scoring systems entirely, among them
<a href = "s.html#spider">Spider and Web</a>. To my knowledge, however, Wearing the Claw was the first
to rid itself of points as an indication of progress, and the author
deserves credit for that.

The other innovation that the author mentions was to weave the puzzles
seamlessly into the plot, rather than having soup-cans-in-the-pantry sort
of puzzles that don't fit into the narrative. This, likewise, succeeds,
though it should be noted that there aren't all that many puzzles, and
what there is isn't all that tricky. Still, given how most IF--then and
now--simply tosses out puzzles to solve, with the implicit promise that
the game will bestow something useful or interesting as a reward for
solving the puzzle, a game that consciously avoids that path is a welcome
change. It should be noted, however, that such an approach probably
wouldn't be possible in a significantly larger game; it's difficult to
provide a predetermined reason for overcoming every obstacle, particularly
things like locked doors, other than that you feel a strange compulsion to
explore your surroundings as thoroughly as possible. It would, at least,
be interesting to see a longer work of IF that attempted to do what
Wearing the Claw does in this regard.

As mentioned above, Wearing the Claw isn't all that difficult; there is
one logical leap toward the end that takes some thought, but most of the
game flows by rather quickly. This was an entry in the 1996 Interactive
Fiction Competition, meaning that it had to be short enough to be
finishable in two hours--and it does, in fact, fit well within that limit.
Though what's here is of high quality, the game does seem to end just as
it gets going, and the player may be left wishing for more to do. (The
&quot;amusing&quot; list is quite extensive, though.) There are quite a few rooms
and objects (in proportion to the size of the game, at least) that play no
part in the plot, which helps the game seem larger than it is--but, that
aside, this shouldn't take anyone very long to finish.

The find-the-McGuffin fantasy setting itself is nothing new, though it
does allow the author to work with some of the hoary IF tropes--and there
are a few twists at the end that do test the player's expectations
somewhat. Moreover, the writing is good enough to sustain the game even
when the plot feels familiar: room descriptions are economical and vivid,
though the style of the conversations owes more to Tolkien than to
everyday parlance. (Sample from the protagonist's mother: &quot;I fear for you,
dear one, but perhaps you can find on your quest some means of restoring
prosperity to our village, which has been too long poor.&quot;) It also helps
that the plot is largely free of glaring inconsistencies or incongruities,
hardly a given even in fantasy settings.

Those who genuinely dislike fantasy probably won't make an exception for
Wearing the Claw, as it doesn't really push the boundaries of fantasy all
that much. As fantasy IF goes, however, it's both thoughtful and
imaginative, and manages to entertain consistently--and for those who
weren't around for the 1996 competition, it might be worth going back to
check this one out.

VERSION: Release 4

Genuinely character-driven IF, as in stories whose plot and puzzles
revolve around interacting with people rather than manipulating
objects, is extraordinarily difficult to realize. Infocom's mysteries
are some of the best attempts at this, but many of the characters even
in those feel mechanical; it is all too obvious that there is a short
list of keywords with appropriate responses. Neil Brown's The Wedding
is not, admittedly, a fully character-driven game, but it does have
that element -- and it illustrates just how difficult a goal it is to
accomplish, even on a limited scale. On the whole, there are many good
things about The Wedding -- but the moments that require interaction
with the various NPCs simply fall flat.

This is not to say that they are bad NPCs; they manage to be
relatively realistic, to respond to an adequate variety of prompts,
and even supply a modicum of humor. But, as so often happens, the
puzzles involving them, though well-imagined, feel painfully
artificial; they reduce the people to robots who will wait 100 turns
for the next line of dialogue, say, or who don't notice notable events
going on around them because they're not told to. One puzzle in The
Wedding, in fact, requires that a character ask you a randomized
question, you wander away surreptitiously and find out the answer, and
then wander back and answer the question as if it were one
conversation. Now, there is an attempt at realism here, in that the
game mocks you if you try to find out the answer on the spot -- but it
trades one silliness for another, in effect, in reducing character
interactions to videotapes that can be stopped and returned to at
will.

The above is a minor absurdity, but there are more significant ones as
well -- for instance, a certain character will (and must) follow you
at a certain point, but not before then, and there is no logical
explanation to the change. Another character's responses to you depend
on your having discovered a certain fact about that character,
regardless of what you do.  The security guard positioned by the front
door is so remarkably dense that it troubles him not a bit that you
come out of that door repeatedly; he simply refuses to allow you back
in. Again, it should be said that these and other flaws in &quot;The
Wedding&quot; illustrate the difficulty of coding realistic people more
than any inadequacy on the part of the author; simple move-the-objects
games are far less taxing. But when it comes to realism (and let's
face it, the major charm of character-driven games is that they can
approximate real life in some measure), there are snags aplenty. It
may be a side effect of building a game around characters rather than
objects that there are quite a few plot holes, some of them
acknowledged by the author in the end credits; one of the main things
that puzzled me was why someone buried something obviously worthless.

The plot of The Wedding is apparently simple: your school chum
Malcolm, due to be married, has disappeared, and you have been called
in to help out -- but, because of family tensions, your mission is
secret, so secret that you have to figure out alternative ways of
getting into the house because the guard hasn't been authorized to let
you in. (My question: if you're such a good friend of this Malcolm
fellow and you're invited to the wedding, why do you have to sneak
into the house?)

After a few elementary clues about what's going on, you commence
solving puzzles in classic &quot;here's a nail, so I'll go look for a
hammer&quot; style; you have a series of puzzles to solve because they're
there, and some are not obviously puzzles at all. (A surly teenager
won't say anything to you? Isn't that just a fact of life, not
something to worry about?) Some of the puzzles are rather clever and
involve use of household gadgetry that, while not wildly inventive in
terms of common sense, requires some steps that few works of IF bother
with. (Put another way: The Wedding is situated so firmly in the realm
of everyday life that it takes some mental adjustment to solve such
down-to earth puzzles.) One hidden item requires an annoyingly exact
command to find, though, and it's possible to bog down and not realize
what's holding you back, and another mechanical puzzle requires
something of an intuitive leap for the proper verb -- but, by and
large, the puzzles are fairly good. Trouble is, as noted, they use the
NPCs in ways that make them little better than props.

The gameplay is likewise a bit uneven -- lots and lots of useless
scenery, for instance (for which you get &quot;that's not something you
need to refer to...&quot; messages, mostly), and some illogicalities, like
a supermarket bag that can hold anything and everything, including a
spade. (There is one character who wants a certain food item -- but
once you bring the food, you can drop it on the floor and he'll never
pick it up, or you can eat it yourself without any protest from him.)

The Wedding has the usual Inform benefits, along with a very limited
hint menu (plus other limited sources of hints worked into the game),
and there are plenty of synonyms for most words -- and the game itself
is wide enough that there are at least a few puzzles to work on at any
given moment. (One puzzle (the dungeon problem) that seems to cry out
&quot;I have more than one solution!&quot; does not, though -- maybe in a later
release?) Dialogue is a bit clumsy as well -- &quot;yes&quot; in response to a
direct question doesn't work; you must type &quot;answer yes&quot; or &quot;say yes
to&quot; whoever, somewhat grating in a game where you learn many things
from the various characters.

The writing is mostly good, though it has rough spots -- there are
some things in room descriptions that perhaps shouldn't be. For
instance, when you first reach the front hall, you get this:

        The great entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of
        jealousy within you -- the grand wooden polished floors and
        staircase, the expensive chandelier hanging from the high
        ceiling, the priceless Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why
        can't you inherit something like this? Leaving aside feelings
        of bitterness...

Fine. Well-written, realistic. Except that you probably shouldn't feel
it the tenth or eleventh time you enter the room -- I mean, you've
probably seen hardwood floors before. Most of the room descriptions
are well done -- descriptive, but controlled -- though I wasn't sure
whether this one was supposed to be straightforward or sarcastic:

        This room offers refuge from the tastelessness that seems to
        prevail around the rest of the house. Framed pictures of
        famous film actresses, Garland, Dietrich, Midler and Streisand
        in particular, hang proudly on the sky-blue walls, alongside
        two extra-large pink and red ribbons. The abundance of style
        extends to the curtains, the most attractive you have ever
        seen. If only the rest of the house, to the south, had been
        decorated as well as this.

Me, I never saw Bette Midler and Barbra Streisand posters as the
epitome of good taste -- nor, for that matter, huge pink and red
ribbons -- but perhaps it's just me. (If this is supposed to be
ironic, it's not well done.) These are quibbles, though, because the
writing here is generally solid and effective -- reasonably
atmospheric and genuinely funny. When you confront one character late
in the game, you get this:

        &quot;Okay, muggins,&quot; you say, &quot;spill the beans, squeak, start
        talking, loosen your tongue...&quot; Then you realise that you are
        getting carried away, and drop the tough cop act.

Not laugh-out-loud hilarious, but amusing nonetheless. There are many
such moments -- the game is littered with Easter eggs, some of which
are pointed out in a &quot;fun stuff&quot; file available when the gane is done
-- that illustrate real interest in making the game enjoyable. (A
television has 8 different channels, all with 10-15 randomized funny
scenes depending on the channel -- the soap opera channel is one of
the best, I think.) Brown has a feel for compact but effective room
descriptions, as in the following:

        Considering the high technology that has gone into guarding
        this area, the cellar is surprisingly lo-tech. One very dull
        fluorescent tube casts gloomy light over the brick walls. The
        air is damp; cobwebs line the ceiling. A tunnel disappears off
        into the darkness to the northeast, and a set of stone steps
        lead east up to the passageway.

For a concept like The Wedding to work, it needs good writing -- there
are few things duller than trying to interact with badly written
characters, or inhabiting a small game environment where the author
hasn't bothered to make the locations interesting or believable. And
the writing here is easily good enough to keep the player involved and
prevent the game from becoming tedious even when nothing is going on,
puzzle-wise, though a few too many of the rooms break the description
by inserting your thoughts or reactions. There are many genuinely
funny moments, as noted, and the whole thing is mercifully free from
signs of taking itself seriously.

There is much to like about The Wedding, in short, and its
shortcomings are more due to the difficulty of its undertaking than to
poor writing or programming; there are enough clever puzzles and
humorous asides for the game to be involving despite the shortcomings
in the plot and setup.  Despite its flaws, The Wedding is a solid
entry in the IF library.

VERSION: Release 1

Suggested "Cheese Rating" according to Emily Short's system: Monterey
Jack, from a parodied book

In an earlier and much briefer review, I claimed "When Help Collides!"
(WHC) "does several new things and does them well". That judgement holds
up after another two hours of playing, and yet somehow the game finished
a middling eighteenth of the 38 pieces in Comp02, owing to what I
surmise are its relative inaccessibility and novelty, and to questions
over whether much of it is Interactive Fiction at all. So the more
reviews the better. Several reviewers even apparently gave up in
bafflement, convinced that they had no interest in discovering the
internal logic of the game, and thus missing the varied entertainment on
offer.

Perhaps this isn't that surprising given the avalanche of an opening,
where the player has to accept two truly surreal premises before
starting play. The first premise on its own is only moderately amusing,
an absurd behind-the-scenes explanation of what goes on in interactive
fiction, involving a metafictional ghost-in-the-machine very similar to
that used in the same Comp's better-received "<a href = "j.html#janitor">Janitor</a>" and perhaps
reminiscent of the demon painter inhabiting cameras in Discworld. In
this case, it is supposed that when a player types "help" in a game,
some gremlin (man? woman? robot?) is charged with receiving the summons,
travelling to the location of the character who asked for help in the
game world and dispensing appropriate hints. Even this interpolation is
more than the game itself states, but it is in fact a logical extension
of the "game world" idea which accounts for the way a particular piece
of software responds to typed commands. Supposedly an aim of IF is to
make us forget the game is a piece of software -- what if the "help
module ship" were itself also a character in that world, however "meta"?

Were it merely an interactive fiction in-joke, however, I would have
rated "When Help Collides!" down for not being relevant to any wider
audience. The actual premise relates to just such a wider audience,
although one that is mostly disjoint with the IF community: what if the
space traversed by help modules is the same as that used for "self-help"
personal advice? Including an external topic to spoof was a good move,
and popular psychology books are a good choice, being pretty easy to
send up, as Alistair Beaton does in his _Little Book of Complete
Bollocks_, which consists of tips such as "Do not be afraid of death.
Death is merely a continuance of life, only without the breathing. Eat
lots of spinach." How would we feel if the hints for a game were
similarly impractical, trite or counter-productive? Not a thought that
is likely to ever occur to most players except in a dream, but the first
"Act" of this game shows us anyway. So the scenario for this section is
an example of genuine surrealist humour in IF, a form which has existed
since "<a href = "a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</a>", but which usually nowadays gives way to some kind
of realism or simple abstraction.

The title, incidentally, would appear to allude to the 1951 B-movie
"When Worlds Collide", concerning a dramatic escape from a doomed Earth,
and also perhaps to the nuttiness of _Worlds in Collision_, the
bizarrely popular pseudo-historical theories of Immanuel Velikovsky,
himself a psychoanalyst.

The story of "When Help Collides!" begins with an explosive crisis, the
"collision" between the two ideas previously mentioned, overwhelming not
just the player character, but also the player. The first line of a new
game, shown on its own in a blank screen without a prompt, reads:

   Amid the mangled virtual-ware littering this sector, your "Best Help"
   trophy stands defiantly. It has survived the crash.

This line is hard to make sense of, particularly without even the blurb
supplied for Comp02 ("Self-Help rams Game-Help. Accident or deliberate
consciousness insinuation?") to provide context. Just enough information
is given in the next line to clue the first command before the titles
and a second collision. The player is supposed to accept all this before
reading:

   Stunned twice in a matter of milliseconds--that's just not right.

This also describes the typical feelings of the player pretty well. One
problem with starting a piece on a high note like this is that it is
impossible to keep the action going at such an extreme pitch for any
length of time, and so we down to some kind of intelligible stability at
various times. The torrent of one-sentence paragraphs begins to
overwhelm. Nevertheless, invention and entertainment keep coming
throughout "When Help Collides!", although it lacks any conventional
dramatic structure.

It also lacks a conventional game structure. Many players got the
impression from the accompanying files that "When Help Collides!"
consists of four completely unrelated sub-games of equal status; it
would indeed be difficult to play all four within a two-hour time limit.
The actual structure is as follows. Halfway through "When Help
Collides!", on entering a scene on a "wagon" (a metaphor made physical),
the narrative path diverges almost randomly into three. Each of these
three paths leads to one of the "outer" games, so that a single pass
through the game would consist of "When Help Collides!", plus one of
"Parched Mesa", "Level 50" or "Bleach of Etiquette" -- it should be much
more possible to complete this combination within the two-hour judging
period. The idea that competition judges could each be judging an
entirely separate game without realising it is itself amusing. Each
sub-game (fortunately mostly too easy too need a help system) has two or
three endings, the obscure optimal one involving a promised
"transformation" with the help of some counsellor figure. The optimal
endings of two also see the return of an object from Act I, while the
third is unexpected, hinting at yet another level to the game.

Unfortunately, the author seems to have committed a tactical error which
helped confuse players. Instead of having "When Help Collides!" segue
into the appropriated sub-game, a non-player character provides a
password to be used after a restart. The reasons for this could have
been partly technical (to overcome the problems of a single game file
with four distinct banners and command sets), partly practical (to
ensure the player has a fixed game position to return to without having
to repeat the first section again, although this could have been ensured
by insisting on a save), and partly aesthetic (to allow the judges to
see the richness of invention in other endings). The actual effect of
including the codes in the accompanying walkthrough was that players
would indeed play the sections in any order, and were therefore less
likely to understand the links between them.

One other factor that might have made WHC (that is, the game as a whole)
less popular was needing to learn a whole new command set to play. This
applies particularly to the "Bleach of Etiquette" sub-game, and the
second "wagon" section of "When Help Collides!". In both cases, the
standard IF world model and language which principally centres on
manipulating physical objects is dispensed with as irrelevant, and
replaced with new ad-hoc actions. The effect of these actions is clued,
but use of "undo" should not be regarded as cheating when getting to
grips with them. Attempting a different interface for a game has in the
past has usually been seen as a good thing, provided it works (Zarf's
"<a href = "s.html#space">The Space Under The Window</a>" comes to mind), and it strikes me that the
same standard should apply here. The button-pushing in the "wagon" scene
is, in fact, not much more confusing than in many other games where the
object is to discover the workings of some piece of machinery, but here
usual verbs such as "put" are more clearly useless, and the only
interesting command remaining is "examine". Amid all this, minor
innovations, such as use of asterisks or brackets to denote the thoughts
of the player character, go almost unnoticed.

In the first Act, we see relevant "help" topics and irrelevant content,
producing gags like:

   A barbaric, hulking figure looks up and asks, "What's 'alignment'?"

   >press help
   "We're all aligned to the same source. But somewhere along the line,
   some of us bend and twist, becoming quite unlike what our creator had
   in mind. Then the labelling begins: Chaotic-evil, lawful-neutral,
   etc... Unless we recognize that we're all in this together, we cannot
   truly become one with the source.

   That poisoned-scimitar-wielding dark elf? Give him a hug. Be
   surprised at what you might find."

The second Act is less predictable and funnier, throwing in even more
elements and further literalizing the metaphors and psychological
constructs. Incidentally, the author warns that the game "works best
with WinFrotz and JZip interpreters", and on others (including most
Linux terps and Windows Frotz 2002) there is a subtle bug, as Andrew
Plotkin noted in his review. This bug doesn't stop progress, but removes
a lot of the fun of dealing with "manifestations".

The game can then take one of three paths, each of which relates to a
genre of interactive fiction, and each of which has an associated
subgame supposedly typical of that genre. These paths are best described
by the game itself as "Western", "Eastern" and "Fantasy", with Fantasy
being the default, naturally enough. This review will give most
attention to the "Eastern" path as that is the one that received most
comment on r.g.i-f.

Fantasy path -- Zarenzo the Black and "Level 50"
------------------------------------------------
   "My name is Zarenzo the Black, and I'm a necromancer. Every waking
   moment claims the need for power and control. The ends always justify
   the means. But when I saw myself in the mirror this morning, saw what
   I had become--the skull cap, the impractical black robes, the horde
   of undead oustide [sic] my window--I realized this has to stop. It
   just has to stop. I am powerless over necromancy."

The final sentence is the punchline, quite rightly -- here we have a
thoroughly evil character doing the equivalent of the "Twelve Steps" of
Alcoholics Anonymous (although Necromancers Anonymous appears to only
have six -- perhaps the Dark Arts allow one to skip the others). It's
quite a nice idea -- instead of playing a hero, or forced to play an
evil PC, here we learn about an evil character and have a chance to
change him. The actual "help" we provide him is rather too glib to
plausibly make any difference, but the scenery is well-implemented
(other than that bug) and fun to play with:

   A tiny fear peeps in your ear. "I'm not finished with you, yet. Just
   you wait, you fu..." It disappears from view before it can finish its
   rant.

Once through this scenario, we receive the password to Act III, the
fantasy subgame "Level 50." This subgame introduces the innovative
elements of its scenario more gently and explicitly than the WHC frame
story does: the PC is not Megnax the Fighter in some fantasy world, but
Jerry Dorkman playing Megnax in some Dungeons and Dragons convention. As
with "<a href = "y.html#youare">You Are Here</a>" in Comp01, this extra fictional level makes merely
cosmetic changes to the story, but allows the author to comment, via the
PC, on its weaknesses; you can get away with a lot when writing a spoof.
Several comments are (I think, accurate) observations about the kind of
weak jokes prevalent among people with high-level D&D characters, such
as an aside about fantasy shopkeepers. Although this is the only
outright comedy among the sub-games, it is self-conscious in its
silliness. When sent to Limbo to bring Law to Chaos,

   >knock on grey door
   "A tinny voice calls out from behind the door. 'Can you come back
   tomorrow? It's been total chaos in here, today. Thanks much.'"

Note here the extra set of quotes, as this is the dungeon master
speaking. We're allowed only the occasional command that works on the
interposing mezzanine reality:

   >smell dungeon master
   (The Phish T-shirt is warning enough.)

As the help system is disabled, we do have a character, Xila the Bard,
who will sing about your inventory to the tune of a Billy Joel song, but
these hints are themselves rather obscure. Some obviously unwinnable
situations are also notable.

Western path -- Winston Puckett and "Parched Mesa"
--------------------------------------------------
Here, Act II of WHC takes its humour from imagined mannerisms and
world-view of the Frontier rather than the moral "alignment" of the
character: Puckett is venal, whereas the other two are thoroughly evil.
Another Act III follows. "Parched Mesa", is subtitled "a classic
western", yet something's gone a bit awry, as if this is another
collision with an unexpected genre -- the dead seem to have swapped
places with the living. This cross-genre aspect may be the real
innovation here, rather than any old "unreliable narrator" stuff. Sparse
implementation in the one mode (such as self-conscious room descriptions
like "The place is as you remember it--with a dearth of furnishings yet
a wealth of love.") is complemented with a fairly full set of standard
responses ("Can't go thataway, pardner.") in the other. There's even an
alternative banner title shown when you start a transcript. This
disconcerting mismatch and other imperfections (infodump from an
anachronistic NPC with three separate roles, an old-fashioned
room-too-scary-to-remain-in) can, maybe unintentionally, heighten
effects such as the sub-optimal ending.

Eastern Path -- Nebusan Sedonkawa and "Bleach of Etiquette"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Berry's irony is at its finest in dealing with the spiritual progress of
Nebusan, as when the vicious Yakuza encounters Step 3 of his recovery
programme. This leads on to "Bleach of Etiquette", which I shall refer
to as "Breach" -- there's nothing essentially racist in the little
pronunciation joke, but it gives the wrong impression of a game that
deals with Japanese culture at least without deliberate ignorance.
Similarly, characterisation of the PC an albino also seemed a little
forced and unnecessary.

There are questions as to whether "Breach" is really interactive
fiction, but the first point to make is that it is at least _fiction_,
in plot, setting, characterisation and dialogue. I do not know enough
about the secret world of the geisha to judge whether the game is really
true-to-life, but regardless of whether it is or not, it manages to
_feel_ authentic and exotic with its minimal descriptions, code names,
and oddly-phrased language. (The one small element of fantasy does not
necessarily undermine this; it could be dismissed as an idiosyncratic
way of viewing or describing things.)

It is commendable that the social status of the protagonist, Demetoria,
is quickly established relative to the NPCs -- higher than some, lower
than others -- thus adding realism to her struggle. We might ask whether
we are somehow complicit in her oppression, but the player is probably
quick to decide that co-operating is the likely to be her best
opportunity, compared to what I imagined was her peasant background. The
puzzle here is in finding whatever desperate strategy uses Demetoria's
limited assets to achieve victory in her test; thinking in character,
and exploration and discovery of hidden elements of the game world help
in this fun challenge, which is a marker that this is not only IF, but
good IF. "Breach" resembles Papillon's underrated "One Week" (LoTechComp
2001) where a young woman tries to juggle all kinds of pressures leading
up to an exam; both have a limited user interface that underlines real
social constraints faced by the character and feel more than a "Choose
Your Own Adventure" game. However, "Breach" differs in having only one
important outcome to worry about, but many elements necessary to achieve
it.

Geishas are not prostitutes, and need to protect their reputation.
Certainty about exactly what favours geisha might do for the people who
pay for their company eludes me. Fortunately, discretion is assured here
by an assortment of well-chosen euphemisms, the most explicit of which
is "Fade to sack." The world depicted in Arthur Golden's "Memoirs of a
Geisha" suggests that this last euphemism is a bit too blatant, unless
we are dealing with the lower orders of geisha. Conceivably, Demetoria
is very fond of some of her clients, but in a way the only important
consideration is how fond they are of her. They are a mixed bunch,
providing a lot of the game's interest. The only stereotype among them
is Vidoru, the electronics company president, who could do with a little
more characterisation. His presence somehow suggested to me a setting in
the early 1970s, when geisha culture was in decline, although a later
reference to Churchill pins it firmly in 1951-5. Of particular interest
among the other NPCs is the woman Chizumi, whose interest in Demetoria
is less to promote equality of sexual orientations than a way of showing
the extraordinary desirability of the geisha character.

To tell the story of this geisha's week using the conventional IF game
model and interface would, I think, be cumbersome and threaten to dilute
the interesting NPC encounters with large amounts of detail. Commands
for wearing make-up might take up half the game . So instead of relating
to the world primarily through a language of physical objects and maps,
"Breach" focuses more realistically on use of time (a limited resource)
and higher-level actions. "Breach" is even modestly subtitled "An agenda
planner", but I feel that excising the trivia of maps and object puzzles
is something of a liberation for character- and plot-based IF.

In effect, commands are entered in batches of seven, and each turn
consumes about three hours, with a game consisting of 41 turns. This
arouses suspicion that "Breach" is not properly IF for two reasons.
Firstly, a command once entered in the batch cannot be altered on the
basis of a previous one, as if the PC lacks free will. To this I answer
that appointment-keeping is a realistic constraint in the absence of
major catastrophe, and that there are still frequent opportunities to
learn from the game, plan, and interact. (In actual fact, "undo" (x7)
becomes very useful when playing to win.) Secondly, that there is only
one really significant verb, "book", showing a paucity of range of
action. However, that same verb is used to cover diverse actions from
harp practice to asking for maths tuition, plus later unexpected
actions. Some actions ("research", "counsel") could have come under
"book" but arbitrarily do not. The PC does in fact increase her powers
during the game, and several times I typed "i" absent-mindedly, rather
than "when all" which gives the closest thing to an inventory. I will
admit that after all the game world features and rules have been
discovered, the combinatorial possibilities of action are not large, and
there may be one or more attempts to solve the game mechanically as a
single puzzle.

The innovations in "Breach" are technically accomplished, and use (or
abuse?) the Inform grammar and model in an interesting new way. I would
hope some of the new elements will influence future game development
somehow.

So overall the Comp release of WHC may lack a little polish, but is too
easily written off as a confusing mess. A little persistence more than
pays off, and the game is much less pretentious than this review might
suggest. "When Help Collides!" is among the strongest pieces to come
from any recent IF competition, playing with expectations like nothing
else for years.

VERSION: Release 2

The first episode in a stated five, this little game was designed to be playable 
in approximately fifteen minutes.  Although it isn't the only very short example 
of interactive fiction out there, it has a more complete feel and takes itself 
more seriously than the few others of a comparable length that I have played in 
my very limited experience.  The plot is amazingly detailed for such a short 
game, moving the player through the scenes rapidly.  The game throws the player 
into the first of two puzzles as soon as play begins; following are two brief 
scenes where the player can pass the time in conversation before the end-game 
puzzle (and then a brief intro to the next episode).  This makes the beginning 
and ending feel somewhat like bookends even though the plot is left dangling for 
part two to pick up.

The puzzles are basically well-implemented; they give the player pause but have 
fairly obvious solutions and are satisfying to solve.  Few, if any, objects are 
implemented that aren't either NPCs or used in a puzzle, and this is a good 
thing in the regard that this points the player's attention to the problem at 
hand, but not in the regard that it doesn't allow for multiple solutions.  This 
is partially made up for by the fact that both puzzles differ from play to play 
according to randomized elements, and one of them requires different objects 
depending on those elements, adding perhaps some replayability.  There are no 
serious or obvious bugs, but I did run into a few responses that were not 
implemented correctly (exceptions to rules and the like).  Perhaps surprisingly, 
both puzzles can end lethally.

The writing is clever but very condensed.  Not many scenery objects can be 
examined, but the terse room descriptions don't even mention many.  The prose 
reveals the setting more than the descriptions alone.  Although the plot is 
serious in nature, the tone is light and humorous.  The writing is probably the 
aspect of the game that more than anything else makes it seem so full and 
satisfying with so little, though the game would be empty without the puzzles.

On the whole, I found the gameplay experience to be slightly similar to the 
experience of reading a prose comedy short story written expertly but 
whimsically; both are sparing on their writing, getting to the point quickly and 
concluding abruptly (I'm thinking specifically of "The Notorious Jumping Frog of 
Calaveras County" by Mark Twain).  All this goes to show that works of humorous 
interactive fiction can still score on the literature scale, even ones that are 
very short in length and have puzzles.

From: Molly G. &lt;rosygirl5657 SP@G yahoo.com&gt;

The When in Rome series, by Emily Short, was written, mostly, to show off the 
new programming language Inform 7. If this game (and the other games written to 
show off Inform 7, available on the Inform website) is any indication, then 
Inform 7 should go far.

Writing/Technical A
The game begins, innocently enough, in Central Park, and only gets better from 
there. The writing in the game is truly superb, with crisp dialogue and funny 
situations. The NPCs are also superb, with a lot of nuances to make them seem 
truly real. My only problem with the technical side as such is that I felt there 
were places where it seemed sloppilly coded(example from beginning: saying GIRL, 
SEARCH [SPOILER] worked, but not ASK GIRL TO SEARCH [SPOILER]), but these 
examples are few and don't detract from the game.

Puzzles B+
The puzzles in this game can be quite a brain teaser, with a tricky puzzle at 
the end that is a kissing cousin to those "logic grid" puzzles you sometimes see 
in magazines. Unfortunately, due to the length of the game (but more on that 
later), there can be said to be only two (maybe three) puzzles in the entire 
game. That said, this is a case of quality over quantity, as the game still 
packs a mean punch of puzzly goodness.

Storyline B
Although writing and story may sound the same, there are cases when good writing 
gets attached to a simply gad-awful story, and vice versa (I feel The Apocalypse 
Clock, from the 2006 IF Comp, proves the former point quite nicely). This is not 
the case with this game. I won't spoil the plot for you, but let's just say if 
you like detective fiction, or science fiction, you definitely don't want to 
miss this game. Doubly so if you like both. Unfortunately, this brings up a 
problem I mentioned briefly above, namely: it's short. The author advertises as 
a lunchtime game, and boy does she mean it. Fortunately the sequel to this game 
has already been released, and hopefully the author will write more. Still, the 
"To Be Continued" at the end can be a downer for those who were just getting 
into the odd events depicted.

Overall A-
The game, if I may mix my scoring metaphors, loses some points for shortness, 
but makes up for it in sheer quality. The game can be completed in about 15 
minutes and is worth every nanosecond of your time.

VERSION: Release 1

The second "When in Rome" episode, "Far from Home," differs from the previous 
installment in that it is basically one puzzle.  There is no advancement of the 
story line to speak of, and there are few implemented details not pertaining to 
the puzzle in the interest of brevity.  A brief prologue and a short epilogue 
are included before and after this puzzle, but the prologue is little more than 
a formality (though it does seem to have an Easter-egg off sorts).  The epilogue 
sets the stage for the next game and hints at plot development.

This one puzzle, then, is what the game should primarily be judged on.  It 
occurs all in one room, which makes this episode significantly less terse and 
more condensed than the previous game.  The puzzle is mostly an analysis sort, 
where you must decide which of several possibilities is correct based on 
observations of certain characteristics.  Those characteristics and the correct 
outcome are randomized for each play, making the game playable several times 
through before it exhausts itself, if one feels inclined to do so.  There are 
several layers of complexity one must work through, including all the steps 
required to observe, some basic gadget manipulating, and humorous (or annoying) 
obstacles thrown in.

I found the puzzle to be rather difficult.  Although I usually enjoy a good 
puzzle, the categorizing and logical elimination required to solve this one 
didn't really suite me.  The first time I played through the entire puzzle, I 
lost at the end, getting the unsatisfactory outcome.  The same thing happened 
the second time I tried, and in the end, the only way I was able to finish was 
by resorting to UNDO every time I got the bad ending and guessing again.  This 
caused even more frustration because I thought that I had reduced the 
possibilities down to two that might have been right; but it turned out neither 
were, and the correct solution didn't make sense to me.

Complaints and frustration aside, the short game was enjoyable even to me.  The 
kind of player best suited for this work would be the serious puzzler who isn't 
afraid to write things down on paper to help crack the puzzle if necessary.  
Still, even people preferring plot development to puzzles won't have to rough it 
out too long; there are hints, and it doesn't take long to get to the final bad 
outcome.  And if you get there you can always cheat like I did and guess until 
you get it right.

VERSION: Release 1 (Competition version)
 
Who Created That Monster is a satire memorable for its effectively
nightmarish vision of Iraq in the not-too-distant future. It contrasts
an ultra-capitalist state installed by the post-war administration
against a highly regulatory security system, which fails to control the
ongoing terrorist problem. Horvath's Iraq is populated by passers-by
acting out strangely polite little interactions, politicians both weird
and terrible, conspiracy theorists, guards and of course the
aforementioned terrorists. Some of the NPCs are extraordinarily
eccentric, which adds to the bewildering and somewhat unsettling
atmosphere of the game.
 
The plot, in which an investigative journalist delves into the dirty
past of Western involvement in Saddam's activities, isn't really up to
much, and the central mystery seems to have a completely arbitrary
solution within the confines of the game world. Some of the writing is
rather peculiar, with bits and pieces of geography, history and
speculation showing up as non-sequiturs, sometimes in room descriptions
and sometimes out of thin air.
 
The programming incorporates a number of imaginative solutions to some
long-established problems. For example, there is plenty of combat, which
under normal circumstances would create an ever-increasing abundance of
corpse objects, cluttering the map and causing parser problems. WCTM
quietly steps around the problem by equipping the characters with
weapons which transform their victims into fleeting clouds of smoke. The
first few times it seems odd and slightly silly, but it does fit nicely
into the almost surreal style of the game.
 
However, the combat system is my main complaint about the game.
Terrorists pop up like dwarves, becoming progressively more difficult to
kill. Faced with the possibility of getting killed by some unlucky dice
rolls, I very quickly went for the walkthrough in order to get the game
finished before the combat became too threatening. Unless a game is
specifically about defeating monsters and levelling up, I really do not
appreciate combat which has the same overall effect as random
deathrooms.
 
_Who Created That Monster_ is an intriguing jumble with an effective
setting; I gave it 7 out of 10.

VERSION: Release 2 

I don't normally review interactive fiction because I'm very picky, not to
mention an awful puzzle solver, and I'd rather not be unfair as well. Often, I
would type quit as the first and only command in a game. Especially when the
work announces itself as experimental.

Not this time around. Whom the Telling Changed begins so... relaxed. You're a
prominent member of a shepherd tribe in the ancient times. Every full moon,
everyone gathers to hear a tale of even more ancient times. Only, tonight the
telling will change the fate of the tribe, and it's up to you to get it right.
The tension, virtually inexistent at first, builds up in perfect gradation. You
can't miss the climax, it's obvious.

Right at the beginning I thought I was facing a guess-the-noun situation but
the vagueness was in fact intentional. At first, I didn't know what I was
supposed to do, either, but it became clear soon enough, thanks to the well-
placed characters, and by that time I was already hooked, anyway. Speaking of
nouns, the writing uses few but effective words, and some of them are keywords;
typing one of these by itself performs the most obvious action for it at the
time, usually ask about. The full command works just as well.

This system showed its strength as the story proper began. My, I love
conversation-based games. It's just that sometimes these are too subtle for me.
Again, not this time around. I really liked how the game decided to convey
important information when I didn't ask about it (here's that command again).
My reactions were probably inappropriate at times, but Telling... weaved them
gracefully into the story. Not that I had many reasons to react: through most
of the second part, the only required command is z. Which was so much the best,
as I didn't quite agree with the player character's views.

Not everything's perfect, of course. At one point, I was told I speak too much,
though I had been silent for most of the time (as another character later
confirmed). At the peak, it finally saw the opportunity to alter the course of
the story, as the author had promised, but choosing the right keyword for the
desired effect required a bit of guesswork; and until the very end, I wasn't
sure I actually made a difference. But the story came out the way I wanted, so
I guess the game works as intended after all.

Telling... is a short, but fresh and satisfactory experience. Play it to the
end, read the afterword, then play it again. You'll have a big (and pleasant, I
hope) surprise. I know I liked it, and I'm waiting for more games in the same
vein.

VERSION: Release 2

I confess I hadn't heard anyone argue that the various bits of shorthand
that IFers have become accustomed to--one-letter compass directions, Z,
X, G, and such--inhibit realism, but Winchester's Nightmare is a game
built, among other things, on that thesis. Beyond that, the game
emphasizes the exploratory aspect of its world to the point where you
can go very far indeed without encountering any puzzles as such. The
result isn't exactly a roaring success, though it has some interesting
moments.

You're Sarah Winchester, wife of the gun manufacturing mogul, and you're
struggling, in terms more figurative than literal, with your conscience
and your family's legacy: specifically, you're wandering two parallel
landscapes, one of them relatively pristine and one, it seems, scarred
by a more violent age. The wandering is the high point of the game,
really, since the author avoids making judgments for you: to what extent
the "after" landscape represents progress or decay, to what extent
you're complicit, and to what extent you can do anything about them are
all left fairly vague. The images are evocative, and the contrasts often
done rather subtly--compare this:

   Sarah is at this island's edge. The wooden platform she stands upon
   runs out from eastern bank, into the Great River, at the brink of New
   City's cluster of buildings.

with this:

   Sarah is at this island's edge. Concrete runs out from eastern bank,
   into the Great River, at the brink of New City's cluster of
   high-rises. A few rusted pieces of rebar jut out, dimly lit from
   nearby streetlamps. South along the water is the entrance to a
   warehouse.

Here, things look like they've taken a turn for the worse, but not
everywhere: some locations move from deserted and bleak to populated and
thriving, suggesting that the game isn't interested in simplistic
judgments. The game's world is full of locations freighted with symbolic
significance--a church, a government complex, an oil field, an armory, a
university--but, again, the game doesn't take it upon itself to connect
the dots. In that respect, Winchester's Nightmare is almost akin to a
painting that incorporates two scenes side by side: there's much to be
observed in the contrasts, and hypothesizing about the significance for
the central character of each aspect of the paintings. Cut-scenes of
sorts, involving characters who appear, say something cryptic to you,
and disappear again, heighten the disjointed feel, but the whole thing,
given some thought, rewards analysis.

As interactive fiction, however, Winchester's Nightmare isn't quite as
successful. For one thing, the author has replaced the > prompt with
"Sarah decides to," again presumably in the service of realism; it's not
quite as confining as the disabled abbreviations, but it's still
jarring, and, more importantly, it reduces the comfort level for the
experienced IF player. It's true that, from a strictly literary sense,
the > and the various abbreviations mutilate the flow of the narrative a
bit; the transcript doesn't read nearly as well that way. But the flow
of the story in the player's mind--the feeling of immersion that's
produced when the player can do what comes naturally (and for veteran
players, X and G do come naturally) without thinking about the mundane
details of having to type in commands to prod the program to output
text--is lost. Others may not feel this way, of course, but the danger
of the approach adopted by Winchester's Nightmare is that it lets form
get in the way of content, and risks dragging the player out of the
story every time the game reminds him or her that one-letter commands
aren't allowed.

A separate but just as damaging problem with the painting aspect is that
you don't have much more interaction with the game's world than someone
viewing a painting; there are a few simple objects, and you can examine
most things, but there's very little that you can manipulate in any real
way. I suppose that's inherent in what the author is trying to do-this
is supposed to be a dream landscape-but still, when you wander through
room after room that doesn't permit any action more dynamic than
EXAMINE, it's easy to feel more like a spectator than a participant.

The real problem, though, is that the game has to go somewhere after
you've been wandering around, and the author's way of making it go
somewhere is pretty difficult to figure out; moreover, even once you've
figured out the basic contours of what you're trying to do, actually
doing it is much more difficult than it should be, and you're likely to
be reduced to wandering through the game looking for random objects,
exploratory mood utterly shot. (You do need to gather some objects, and
there's not a lot of rhyme or reason to where you find them.) You may
get lucky and hit on the puzzle solutions immediately, but if you don't,
the game's strongest point--the complexity of its setting, and the
number of rooms that are there simply to fill out the landscape--becomes
a major nuisance, since you'll be wandering through dozens of rooms that
aren't useful for puzzle-solving purposes. It would have been better, in
other words, if this particular story had abandoned puzzles entirely, or
at least minimized their difficulty; having to turn to object-hunting,
after spending so much time just absorbing your surroundings, is a major
wrench. In a way, the puzzles that you solve aren't otherwise
inconsistent with the feel of the game: they're heavily steeped in
symbolism and they involve somewhat nonlinear thinking. Moreover, it
would arguably be a lesser game with no conflicts to overcome, and
puzzles are probably the best (and only) of creating real conflict in
IF. The trick, here, is to give the player a sense of conflict without
impeding the flow of the story, and it doesn't really work here;
perhaps, if you had a strong hint early on in the game about what you're
supposed to be doing and how you 're to go about it, the player could
combine his or her exploration with puzzle-solving in the first place.

There are lots of good ideas floating around in Winchester's Nightmare,
including some rather intriguing ones about ways to explore the
psychology of the PC. (Even if the game doesn't supply much of the
content outright--again, you have to fill in a lot of blanks--the
character of Sarah is far from simple.) They're hampered, however, by
some unfortunate game design choices, and the end result works better
from a purely literary standpoint than as interactive fiction--an
experiment worth trying, perhaps, but not all that satisfying for the
player.

TITLE: Winter Wonderland
AUTHOR: Laura A. Knauth
E-MAIL: Laura.Knauth SP@G Stanford.edu
DATE: 1999
PARSER: Inform standard
SUPPORTS: Z-code interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)

VERSION: Release 1

Laura Knauth's Winter Wonderland is unfortunately named--it brings to
mind a horrible, insipid song, for one thing--but also accurately named;
the genre is fairy-tale, and "wonderland" is the best way to describe
the game's gentle, nonthreatening world. Players who don't mind things
like dryads and fairies will find much to enjoy in Winter Wonderland;
players who do, however, are advised to steer clear.

The premise should tell the potential player all he or she needs to know
about Winter Wonderland: you're a little girl sent into town to buy a
single candle so that your family will have something to put on its
tree. You'd really like to buy some shoes for your sickly younger
brother Sander, but your family's too poor to afford shoes for both of
you. Along the way, you stumble into a magical realm replete with the
aforementioned dryads and fairies and other things of that ilk. While
everything is quite well done, about as well done as it can be, the
nature of the game--where is HTML-TADS when it's needed? we need wailing
strings and chiming bells here--is such that it's the ultimate in Not
Everyone's Cup of Tea.

The puzzles (for there are quite a few of them in the magical realm)
aren't anything special, on the whole; they are more akin to artificial
roadblocks (bad) than problems seamlessly integrated into the story
(good). Most of them boil down to doors to unlock in order to obtain
objects that will unlock other doors; the saving grace is that the
writing is plentiful and quite good. Some of the doors, to be sure, are
unlocked in creative ways, but by and large the puzzles are just
puzzles, and there's nothing unifying the puzzle-solving in any
meaningful way. It's a shame, and it's a little strange, since the game
takes care to develop the framing story--but then dumps you in the magic
forest, and you're to assume that if you wander around and solve a bunch
of puzzles, things will be all right in the end. Winter Wonderland has a
lot of company there, of course, in Infocom's games among others--but IF
has been moving away from that model in recent years. It is also worth
noting that one puzzle toward the latter stages of the game is simply
poorly implemented (and the hints, helpful elsewhere, are no help here),
and my enjoyment of the game as a whole waned as I struggled with the
poor implementation, I fear. Other than that, however, the game is very
solidly implemented; there are no alternate solutions, as far as I know,
but the given solutions are reasonably well clued and logical (though a
few rely on effects that could not have been anticipated), and there are
no major bugs.

As noted, the writing is plentiful and generally good enough to overcome
the flaws in the puzzles, though there is rather a lot of it; the
tendency here is toward more details rather than less. That's not so
inconsistent with the overall feel of fantasy, though, where big splashy
descriptions are more or less acceptable (whereas real-world-type
settings are better served by just a few sentences to bring out the
salient details). The main problem with the writing is that there are a
few too many adjectives and adverbs, even given the setting, and some of
the descriptions are a bit overwritten; the initial paragraph setting
the scene (think movie voice-over) is an example:

   In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy
   mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming
   winter solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut
   at the outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her
   closest companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen
   seriously ill with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed
   upon which he lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that
   such circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to occur
   upon this solstice eve. 

"Nestled," "joyously," "humble," "seriously," "young" twice, "fanciful",
etc. There are also some grammar problems (though the sheer amount of
text tends to obscure them), but on the whole the writing is reasonably
good. It's just--well, depending on your mood, it might come across as
saccharine. Or it might come across as charming. Similar is the dryad
who speaks in verse; it's reasonably competent verse, but it verges on
being a little much.

Perhaps the best way to describe Winter Wonderland is that it fits very
snugly within its genre, namely earnest and occasionally heart-tugging
fairy tale, and does very little to push that genre's boundaries.
There's nothing inherently wrong with that, especially since that in
particular is ground less trodden than some areas of IF (et tu,
trapped-in-the-research- lab?), but it does require that the reader
accept the conventions of the genre and put aside even the remotest
vestige of cynicism. Any work of fiction that deals with the
holiday-time struggles of a poor family whose youngest child is sick is
already toeing the self-parody line; Winter Wonderland does about as
well as any game could to avoid crossing the line. Winter Wonderland is
also one of the few genuinely child-friendly games since Infocom left
the scene, and it's far more bearable for adults than, say,
Seastalker--but very few games are universally accessible to and
enjoyable by both children and adults, and this is not one of them.

I, personally, enjoyed Winter Wonderland quite a bit; perhaps I was in
the right mood. But while it's well-crafted IF in most respects, it's
not the sort of thing that will necessarily appeal even to all fans of
well-crafted IF. For my part, I gave it an 8 in this year's competition.

  NAME:  Wishbringer:  The Magick Stone of Dreams
                                      GAMEPLAY:  Infocom Standard
  AUTHOR:  Brian Moriarty             PLOT:  Pretty Good
  EMAIL:  ?                           ATMOSPHERE:  Very Good
  AVAILABILITY:  LTOI 2               WRITING:  Very Good
  PUZZLES:  Average                   SUPPORTS:  Infocom Ports
  CHARACTERS:  Above Average          DIFFICULTY:  Introductory

     Although it's not widely realized, Wishbringer takes place in the
Zork/Enchanter universe.  The Festeron Town Library, where the Legend
of Wishbringer book is checked out from is also the source of some of
the documention found in <A HREF="z.html#zorktril">the Zork Trilogy</A>.  In Wishbringer, you begin
as a mail clerk in the Festeron Post Office, who is sent to deliver a
letter to the Magick Shoppe at the other end of town.  When you get
there, you discover that the shop owners' cat is being held by the Evil
One in exchange for the magick Wishbringer stone.
     When you leave the Shoppe you discover that the old woman has
slipped you the stone, and that the town of Festeron has changed into a
dark caricature of itself called Witchville.  As you explore, you find
that the former items and occupants of the town have transformed into
twisted alter egos of themselves (the effect is much like that of
classic Star Trek's &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; episode).  Your mission is to
defeat the Evil One and your boss, Mr. Crisp, and to transform the town
back into Festeron, with the help of the Wishbringer stone, some
friendly platypii, and your own raw wits.
     Wishbringer's puzzles are generally very easy, and most of them
have multiple solutions, being solvable either through reasoning, or
using the Wishbringer stone to wish for some sort of aid.  But if you
rely too much on the wishes, you may fail to acquire items that you may
need to solve later puzzles.  In online conferences author Brian
Moriarty has said that because of this, the moral of the story is that
frivolous wishing can be a bad thing.
     The atmosphere wavers between being comic and sinister, and is
difficult to classify.  At times it seems almost as though it is trying
to be a children's game, what with having the plot revolve around a
kidnapped cat, and supplying such fanciful images as talking platypii,
and disembodied boots that patrol the town.
     Wishbringer was one of the 5 older titles chosen to be reissued in
a bare bones Solid Gold edition with onscreen hints.  This was probably
purely to extend its marketing cycle, as it is one of the Infocom games
that least needed onscreen hints.  Indeed, the &quot;wish for advice&quot; 
function of the Wishbringer stone already partially fullfilled this
role.  Since the Solid Gold editions had greatly reduced documentation,
the Legend of Wishbringer book was deleted from the packaging and
incorporated into the program itself, appearing as a storybook in your
starting inventory.
     Wishbringer was also one of the books chosen to be novelised in
Avon's Infocom books series.  The novelization of Wishbringer, written
by Craig Shaw Gardner, author of the Batman Returns novelization (among
others) deals with a different transformation of the town, and a
different postman named Simon, who deals with the problem in a
different way than in the game.  Though very well written in points,
and one of Avon's better Infocom books, the plot is not always
completely consistent.  For example, at one point we are told that the
Evil One needed to physically acquire the stone to make the
transformation permanent, and that if no one had it that that it would
be temporary.  Later, we are told contrarily the Magick Shoppe owner
must herself possess the stone in order to prevent the transformation
from being permanent.  Since she had voluntarily let the stone out of
her possession in the first place, this makes her look either very
stupid, or very confused, or both.
     Wishbringer is generally a very fondly remembered game, even by
those who feel moved to apologize for the ease of the puzzles.

As a postal clerk in the small seaside town of Festeron, your only
problem, apart from the occasional angry poodle, is your even angrier boss,
Mr. Crisp.  When he tells you to take a special-delivery letter to the 
Magick Shoppe right outside town, you have no idea that this errand
will throw you right into the middle of a life-or-death struggle
between good and evil, or that your idyllic, maybe a little boring
life will be turned into a nightmarish parody of itself...

This is the beginning of _Wishbringer_, one of Infocom's
&quot;introductory&quot; games. That label has led people to dismiss it as a
trifle, or as aimed at a juvenile audience. It is true that the game
is a little smaller, a little easier, a little less complex than
Infocom's &quot;big&quot; games. It is also a little nicer to the player (it's
very hard to get killed, and at some places you get warned to save
your game before attempting some dangerous action). 

To draw the conclusion that the game is in any way inferior to other
games would be a big mistake, however. In fact, I regard this game as
one of Infocom's very best products: a small-scale masterpiece.  The
puzzles may be easy, but they're original and innovative. The game may
be less complex than, say, <A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork</A>, but complexity is not necessarily a
virtue by itself. It may be aimed at a juvenile audience - but aren't
most computer games? 

What I like the best about this game is that it works with small
means. There are no horrible monsters, no monstrously evil
super-villains - but the transformation of idyllic Festeron into a
distorted, evil mirror image of itself is far more effective; at least
the first time I played it, it managed to fill me with a fundamental,
existential dread that is much worse than any fear for monsters or
evil wizards. 

Still, the game never becomes gothic or macabre; the genre is
horror-comedy, and the balance between horror and humour is nicely
kept. The humour never becomes facetious or intrudes on the plot, but
derives mainly from the sheer absurdity of the situation; the horror
aspects never degenerate into empty fireworks or become so terrible as
to stop the humour from working. All the time, you have this anxiety and
feeling of threat at the back of, but it never gets bad enough to keep
you from enjoying yourself - it's more like watching 'Twin Peaks' than
'Aliens^3'.

The game also has great charm, not only in its loving attention to
detail, but also in its references to other Infocom games (how many
people have seen the family life of grues and lived to tell about
it?). Add to this engaging and memorable NPC's (the most memorable
being, perhaps, something as improbable-sounding as the mailbox from
<A HREF="z.html#zork1">Zork 1</A>), a set of very clever (though simple) puzzles (the video game
and the blurry room are expecially noteworthy), excellent writing, and
some breathtaking cliffhangers, and you get a very good game indeed. 

A nice touch is that the major puzzles have alternative solutions; the
Wishbringer of the title turns out to be an object in the game, and
with that in your possession you can wish for various things, such as
darkness, rain, or flight. I managed to find the &quot;scientific&quot; 
solutions to all puzzles; however, for beginning players it may be
nice to have a way around difficult problems - and of course it adds
variation to the game.

The endgame, finally, is everything it should be: brief, not too
difficult, suitably climactic (though not flashy) - and it also
manages to provide a surprise at the very end, when you thought
everything was nicely wound up.

My only major complaint is that it is quite easy at some places to get
the game into an insolvable state, without noticing that until much
later; this lowers the gameplay score slightly, though the puzzles are
sufficiently simple that it's not too difficult to start over again.

All in all, this is a very enjoyable little game, as well as an
excellent piece of writing. As an introduction to Infocom, or to IF in
general, it is superb; for experienced adventurers it provides a
delightful diversion from the complexities of games such as <A HREF="c.html#curses">Curses</A> and
<A HREF="s.html#spell">Spellbreaker</A>.

        The year, 1938.  The place, Los Angeles.  A wealthy but paranoid man
has asked you, a police detective, for protection.  But despite everything
you do, the man is killed.  Can you find who killed Freeman Linder?  The
Witness was Infocom's second detective adventure; its parser contains many
of the commands now standard to this genre.  The writing is the weakest part
of the game; many times I felt as if Stu Galley had simply lifted whole
chunks of clever responses from Deadline, the first Infocom detective
adventure.  The plot is well-laid out, though linear in nature.  The
characters is where the game shines.  There are really only three to deal
with, one of whom you can discount almost from the first of the game. 
However, those two remaining NPCs are quite alive and feisty.  I gave my
wildcard points for the feel of both the game overall and the characters.
     The Witness is available (where else?) in The Lost Treasures of Infocom
1, available from Activision.  The repackaging is flawed, but at least it is
available.  The Witness is a good medium-difficulty detective game.  After
you finish <A HREF="m.html#moonmist">Moonmist</A>, work on The Witness, then Deadline, as they become
progressively harder.

        Who killed Freeman Linder?  You came to his house to protect him from
an unknown threat, but he has been murdered nonetheless.  In Witness, 
you take the role of a 1930s police detective and must find out what 
caused Linder's demise.  Question the suspects and search the Linder 
estate for clues that will bring you closer to the truth.  Witness was 
Infocom's second mystery game, and is nowhere near as difficult as 
Deadline.
        The plot flows quickly, and it is rather easy to stumble upon 
the guilty party.  However, Witness does a great job at capturing the 
feel of the 1930s.  This is achieved partly from the writing, but more so 
by the characters.  The NPCs are interesting and provide the player with 
entertainment after all the puzzles have been solved.  Witness is easy 
compared to many of Infocom's other titles, but it is still enjoyable.  
Witness can be found in LTOI 1, and serves as an excellent introduction 
to interactive mystery to gamers.

You've been hired by Freeman Linder, a businessman who is scared for his
life.   After you arrive to his home, he tells you his story, just before he
is shot.  Now you've got a murder to solve, before its too late.

This is an excellent game. But then, as it was the first game I ever played,
more then 10 years ago, I may be somewhat partial to it.  It features one of
the most coherent, realistic mysteries, and possibly one of the most
consistent stories all together.  Mr. Galley worked hard on this one and it
shows.  There are no plot holes, and the game makes complete sense.  That is
one of the vital things about a mystery, and even more so an interactive one,
where you have to consider every possible storyline, and every tangent you
can take.  [For example, try not going to the house one time and see what
happens].  He also is careful to place clues in the writing.  You could just
follow the &quot;obvious&quot; beginning path and get at least 2 clues without
examining or questioning anybody.

Another important step is having good, believable characters, and this is
where Mr. Galley truly shines.  The characters here are as believable as they
have ever been in text adventures.  They lie, bluff, change their minds and
more.  They move around with reasons, and will keep in mind you (The
detective) when considering their actions.  I'll admit, I fell in love with
Monica, despite her calling me a masher consistently.  I would, however, have
liked at least one more character to have had.  Three is never a good number
to pick when making mystery suspects.  I would have liked someone from Mr.
Linder's business, for example.  Still, I won't be too choosy.

The puzzles in this game are standard mystery type.  You question the mystery
suspects.  You read the prose carefully for clues.  You spy on characters and
their actions.  You try to search every room and examine every evidence you
find, with Sgt. Duffy by your side to help assist when you need his help.

The atmosphere is well done, if sometimes overly cliched.  But, for some
reason, I think Mr. Galley may have wanted that effect.  You were watching an
old 30's mystery movie, not conducting a criminal investigation.  Still,
while most people think that it has the atmosphere of the Maltese Falcon, I
would tend to think it was more like the Charlie Chan movies.  You weren't
heading off everywhere to look for clues, just remaining in a somewhat
restricted area, questioning people.

TITLE: Words of Power
AUTHOR: Stark Springs
EMAIL: (I wasn't able to find one listed)
DATE: 2002
PARSER: Glulxe
SUPPORTS: Glulxe interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF archive.
URL: <a href = "https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/words.zip">https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/glulx/words.zip</a>
VERSION: 4

My initial reaction to this game was, to say the least, mixed. It is a
Glulx work, with a complicated UI, pictures, and (though I couldn't hear
it on my computer) sound: clearly a lot of effort had gone into the
production. On the other hand, one of the first things I encountered was
a talking cat. My natural allergy to excessively cute cliches kicked in,
and I set the game aside for a time. Eventually I came back to it, and
I'm glad I did.

Stark Springs' game is ambitiously packaged. It comes with two pdf files
of background material, which represent reading matter you find during
the course of the game; only a password (learned in-game) can unlock
them. Considering that there's quite a lot of this material, I
appreciated the chance to read that material in the pdf format rather
than from the game screen. Having the huge amount to read early in the
game reminded me, negatively, of a similar effect at the beginning of
Fort Aegea, where I didn't care for it. All the same, having a pdf
worked in Springs' favor: I knew that I could always come back and refer
to the file later if necessary, and it was also possible to skim it
without reading everything, so that I knew roughly what I was going to
be in for later. The massive infodump is still not my favorite way of
revealing backstory, but if there had to be an infodump, this is as good
a way as any.

Besides the pdf files, there's a complex graphical interface. Along the
right side of the screen is the conversation menu; along the top, the
status bar; and along the bottom, buttons representing the Words of
Power. The text color and background are frequently changed, a la
<a href = "p.html#photopia">Photopia</a>, to suggest changes in setting and atmosphere.

All this UI gadgetry could have been confusing, but, on the whole, I
didn't find it so. The conversation menu looked perhaps a bit awkward
crammed into a narrow space where all the sentences had to wrap -- I
think I would have designed that differently, and perhaps put the power
buttons on the right and the conversation menu at the bottom of the
screen -- but I found that I quickly got used to the effect. The
conversation menu was also decorated with an illustration of whichever
NPC you're talking to, a bit like Fallacy Of Dawn. In a game with a fair
number of NPCs, this is quite useful, because it provides a visual hook
in addition to the NPC's name to help the player remember who everyone
is.

Speaking of the conversation menu, conversation in the game uses a
technique similar to some I've used myself: the player is allowed to
choose a piece of dialogue from the menu, or else to change the topic of
conversation to something else. Important bits of dialogue can be
repeated ("Tell me again what you know about the forest..."), and the
topics available to switch to are listed in the menu as well. I found
this fairly effective and easy to use, except that there were a number
of times when I would have liked to be able to talk about something that
wasn't available: for one NPC I met repeatedly during the game, it would
have been nice if additional conversation items had appeared over the
course of the plot so that I could have discussed more of my discoveries
with him. But it's always a challenge to provide what the player will
experience as "enough" conversation in a game, and I understand the
limitations that might have prevented Springs from adding more.

As for the Words of Power mentioned in the title: Springs has invented a
magic system based on combining elements to construct a complete spell.
The elements can be verbs, nouns, or modifiers, and they are all
represented as buttons at the bottom of the screen, so that there's no
need to memorize the vocabulary. This gives the player a nice range of
action, using a syntax that is not much different from the standard
command structure used to communicate with an IF game in the first
place. It's easy to work out new combinations to suit new occasions. As
a concept, such magic is more sensible than the spellcasting system of
Enchanter and its followers, and it lends itself more readily to
exploration or invention by the player.

There are a few flaws. I would have liked to see a more interesting
treatment of the effects of failure when the magic was cast incorrectly
or on the wrong thing; a few inventive messages here would both have
helped teach the player how to use the magic correctly, and provided
some local color. But even so, I didn't find it particularly difficult
to learn to use the Words. In fact, I would have liked to see a larger
selection of them -- the system has more potential than this game
actually exercised, I think. The number of words available befits a
relatively short game (as this is), but I would have enjoyed playing
with the combinations even more.

The setting is something of a mixed bag. Examining objects tended to
reveal no more than was already in the room description. For instance:

   Stone Road
   When the path leads you out of the tree cluster, the scene in front
   of you seems unreal and it takes you a few moments to figure why. A
   large plain stretches to the west, but you can see no horizon line,
   only a hazy band, far far away, of a darker blue than the sky. The
   sun, huge and orange like a basketball hangs low in the sky. A
   neglected road, paved with round, irregular stones and overgrown with
   grass makes its way from north to south and its both ends are lost in
   the same haze that replaces the horizon line.

   The cat ambles along.

   >x road
   The road is paved with round stones and looks neglected.

There's nothing to be seen here that we haven't seen already, and I was
initially disappointed by the effect. As I played on, I got used to it:
this is not a heavily puzzle-centric game, and obsessively examining
everything is not the point. Ultimately the game succeeds in teaching
the player what sort of interaction is required by politely discouraging
fruitless kinds of action.

Speaking of the descriptions, the writing is somewhat unpolished in
spots -- the sentence that begins "A neglected road" goes on a bit too
long, while the phrase "its both ends" seems a bit unidiomatic.

For all that, if you look past the form of the writing to the content
itself, that content is fairly evocative. Here is a fantasy game (sort
of -- there's magic, and a talking cat), but it is set on a planet built
like a science fiction planet, with a different diameter and a more
distant sun. The effect, an impression of great age and distance, is
both beautiful and melancholy. In fact, the whole map of the game is
built on the same massive scale, with locations that encompass entire
ruined cities and forests. Some elements of the story are a little too
familiar, perhaps -- the race of forest-dwellers and the race of miners
smacks of Tolkien, and other pieces of the backstory ring a little too
familiar -- but not all of them. So on the whole the setting could have
been more sharply imagined and better described, but there were enough
intriguing elements to keep me engaged. I found that I liked it best if
I mentally translated the descriptions into a kind of cinematic
treatment, with many desolate landscape shots.

The story likewise turns out to be more interesting than I originally
anticipated; it takes several bends without ever ceasing to make perfect
sense, and it also manages finally to fuse the story and the puzzle
system into a bit of in-character decision-making of the kind I like
best, where the player has the power to make a critical decision based
on the puzzle-solving skills and plot knowledge she's picked up. It's a
technique I associate with really great game design, and though the
effect here isn't quite as powerful as the effect of a similar juncture
in <a href = "s.html#spider">Spider and Web</a>, it's still in excellent company.

Despite some early apprehension, I also found the game extremely
playable. The story controls the pacing: I was never stuck at any point,
and those few times when I found myself even slightly at a loss soon
resolved themselves. There's enough for the player to do that the effect
doesn't feel completely linear and closed off, too -- and this is not an
easy balance to strike.

The final verdict, then: this is a pretty good game in several ways. If
it had been sharpened a little on a couple of fronts -- the magic system
deepened, the characters given a bit more edge and complexity, the
writing polished -- it could perhaps have been a great game. As it is,
it falls shy of great, even occasionally slips into mediocre, but there
is still plenty to make it worth playing. I liked the magic system quite
a lot, and liked the way the UI helped the player with it; if there were
to be a sequel or another game using this system, I would be interested
in playing it. I have even forgiven the presence of the talking cat.

  NAME: World                           PARSER: Limited
  AUTHOR: Doug Mcdonald                 PLOT: Simple but non-linear
  EMAIL: ???                            ATMOSPHERE: Superb

Five and a half years ago, when I first got full access to the
Internet, one of the first things I did was to look for FTP sites with
interesting software. Finding the Usenet source archives on uunet was
marvellous; finding the source to a large adventure game there
was even more exciting. I downloaded the game, tried it on my Unix
workstation, and liked it so much that I brought it home and compiled
it on my PC at home. The game was called &quot;World&quot; and was _huge_; due
to its sheer size, I never completed it (I got stuck about 75%
through, put it aside for a few days, and never got about to complete
it), but it made a lasting impression. When writing these reviews for
SPAG, I couldn't resist the impulse to dust off my old copy of &quot;World&quot; 
to see if it's lost any of its attraction over the years; to my joy,
it hadn't.

&quot;World&quot; is a game in the tradition of the old mainframe adventures
like <A HREF="a.html#advent">Colossal Cave</A> and <A HREF="z.html#zorktril">Zork/Dungeon</A>. This means that it's a big game
(several hundred locations), with a heavy emphasis on treasure-hunting
and exploration. Unlike those games, however, the author has managed
to create a much more coherent world - which doesn't stop it from also
being a world that is very varied and offers a lot of surprises.

The story is simple: you, being a lowly latrine orderly on a starship
that's just landed on an alien planet, have volunteered to explore it
on foot. By collecting alien artifacts and specimens of interesting
wildlife, you hope to earn a (long overdue) promotion. The planet soon
turns out to have quite a few surprises in store for you...

While the plot may not be that great, what makes this game memorable
is the outstanding atmosphere. Somehow, the author manages to make a
world which is quite improbable when you think about it, and which is
filled with quite a few of the cliches of Sci-Fi, seem very
convincing. You not only get the feeling that &quot;you're there&quot;, you experience
that elusive feeling that is the very essence of science fiction - the
sense of wonder.

The writing is very good, with lots of long, very graphic descriptions
of a weird and wonderful, alien world. The mainframe tradition is
noticeable in that the author doesn't shy away from using long
descriptions - fortunately without falling into the trap of excessive
verbosity or overuse of purple prose. 

Unfortunately, the parser and vocabulary aren't quite up to the
standard of the writing, reducing playability and leading to a few
&quot;guess the verb&quot; situations. Still, it's not worse than your typical
AGT parser, and since most puzzles don't require any advanced
manipulation of objects you can get along quite well. Also, some
slight misses (which would surely have been found by more extensive
playtesting) detract somewhat from the overall impression.

As an adventure _game_, &quot;World&quot; isn't very remarkable; it does stand
out, however, in the way its author manages to give credibility,
texture and atmosphere to a totally alien world.

TITLE: Worlds Apart
AUTHOR: Suzanne Britton
E-MAIL: tril SP@G igs.net
DATE: 1999
PARSER: TADS standard
SUPPORTS: TADS interpreters
AVAILABILITY: Freeware (IF Archive)

VERSION: Release 2

A variety of adjectives could well be applied to Suzanne Britton's
Worlds Apart, but the main one that comes to mind is "rich." Rich in
story, rich in characterization, rich in description, and generally rich
in details of every kind--there's nothing thin or underdone about Worlds
Apart. Whether any given player enjoys the story depends on the player,
of course, perhaps even more so than in most IF: the plot depends on
abstractions to an unusual extent, and keeping up with it requires a
certain openness to unusual ways of information processing. Still, this
is one story that rewards persistence on the player's part, and those
who don't make the effort are missing something special.

What's going on is--well, figuring out what's going on is one of the
game's few real puzzles, so it won't be revealed here, but suffice it to
say that almost no information is given to you initially. The process of
discovering who and where you are and what you're doing there is rather
deliberate; there's a lot of information to glean over the course of the
story, but very little of it is available initially, which makes the
game somewhat less immediately accessible than it might be. Contributing
to this problem is the world you inhabit, which may fairly be described
as alien; there are plenty of unfamiliar names and terms scattered here
and there, and while they all eventually either get explained or become
obvious, a player could be forgiven for finding the learning curve a bit
steep at first.

There's an upside to all the strangeness, however, that comes as the
story develops: the player's imagination is freed to an extent it might
not be if all the quantities were initially known. The flora and fauna
you discover, for example, are given primary characteristics, but mostly
the details are left for the player's mind to fill in. Dan Schmidt's
<a href = "f.html#for">For a Change</a> did something similar (though to a much greater extent,
of course, since the level of abstraction there was much higher), and in
many ways it's a liberating experience to be encouraged to fill in
relevant sensory details for yourself. Paralleling this are the verbs
that you use to interact with other characters and with the environment,
verbs which either aren't standard-IF at all or are used in highly
unusual ways; the player is forced to put together his or her own images
of how those verbs work.

The plot, for its own part, has its own logic, which, like everything
else, may not be initially apparent; themes that seem quite sensible
after they're encountered a few times may simply be baffling the first
time or two they appear. There's an adaptive hint system that fills in
most of the gaps (though not all), and while Worlds Apart is far from
puzzle-oriented, it's likely that most players will end up using the
hints at least once or twice. It's not so much that the puzzles are hard
as that they require being on the author's wavelength. One that
initially stumped me involved applying recently learned knowledge, and
while I recognized immediately what to do, I didn't manage to supply the
proper verb for quite a while. (It wasn't a verb that I, or anyone else,
had ever encountered before, and while the game gave me an obvious clue,
I tried to convey the action through more conventional verbs.) This
isn't, I hasten to add, a bad thing. The world of Worlds Apart is all
the more immersive for its strangeness. But it's not impossible that
some might find it frustrating.

One of the greatest strengths of Worlds Apart is its cast of characters.
True, you don't interact with them in especially complex ways; many of
the interactions amount to cut-scenes, and much of the rest of it is
ASK/TELL--but these are impressively complex characters. There isn't a
thoroughgoing hero or villain among them; all have their faults and
virtues, and while some are more likeable than others, none are there
merely to be loved or loathed. Better still, their various personalities
aren't merely identifying features ("here comes X, and he's going to
display his character trait so that we don't confuse him with Y")--the
plot depends on those personalities, and understanding the characters
mean understanding why the plot unfolds the way it does. They also have
some fairly complex relationships with each other, and much of what you
learn about them you pick up secondhand, adding to the complexity.
Better still, there's one character whose motivations and true nature
are almost entirely open to interpretation (or so it seemed to me), and
how the player chooses to perceive that character's actions may, or may
not, shape how he or she views the rest of the story. There's no special
technical wizardry that I could discern behind the character
development--just good writing and lots and lots of ASK/TELL topics--but
they come alive, arguably more so than in any work of IF in memory. And
if some remain a bit opaque at the end of the story, well, it adds to
the aura of mystery.

The writing is uniformly excellent: it's full of details, as noted, but
generally the descriptions aren't so long that they become ponderous.
Typical of this economical approach is this passage:

   You have come to a secluded glade, half-sheltered from the elements
   by the many trees extending their branches out over the clearing. One
   of these in particular catches your eye, a gentle giant of a ch'nuka
   whose boughs stretch wide in every direction. Once, it might have
   shaded this place on its own, but now it shows signs of failing
   health--some of the branches are almost bare, and decaying leaves
   surround the trunk in piles and litter the clearing, although it
   feels like summer, and the other vegetation here is thriving.

All the details necessary to set the scene are here--tree, leaves,
vegetation--but the author also manages to convey the feel of the
setting, and the tree that dominates the glade also dominates your
impression of the place. The decay of the ch'nuka is more important than
the continued vitality of the surrounding vegetation, and so it
dominates the description; had the author chosen to give the other
vegetation more attention, the extent to which this particular tree
affects your perception of the scene would be lost. Moreover, the
contrast between the dying tree and the thriving vegetation wouldn't
work as well if it were explicitly pointed out; leaving the reader to
draw the contrast and wonder about it works much better. Here, and
elsewhere, the author eschews a camcorder approach for a more
subjective, intuitive account--the aspect of the scene that draws your
attention not only is described in more detail, but also colors your
overall view of the setting. The author's writing skills are
particularly apparent late in the game, when there's a Wishbringeresque
transformation of your surroundings; not only are the changed features
of the landscape vividly rendered, but every scene is emotionally
charged in ways similar to the above.

Worlds Apart is not a flawless effort (as opposed, of course, to all
those flawless works of IF out there). There are some questionable game
design choices--at one point, for instance, you happen across a book
with a great deal of information that becomes pertinent to a certain
task, or series of tasks. Unfortunately, you can't take the book with
you when you're carrying out the tasks (logically, given the nature of
the assignment), and you may end up having to retrace your steps to
consult the book that you couldn't take with you. The worldbuilding that
the inclusion of the book accomplishes is outstanding--thorough and
plausible--but the frustration aspect threatens to yank the player out
of an otherwise immersive scene. The progress of the story sometimes
depends too much on wandering around and eventually noticing that
something has changed in an unforeseeable way, and while that encourages
frequent re-exploration, it may prove frustrating to the player who
wants the story to keep moving. The hint system fills in the gaps most
of the time, but there are a few gaps. And the end is a bit abrupt;
there's a reference to a possible sequel, but it's disappointing to
leave the game's world with so much unresolved.

There is much to like about Worlds Apart, in the end--in quantity and
quality, the detail that went into the worldbuilding is unmatched in any
work of IF in recent memory, and it's unlikely that any player will
catch all, or even most, of the story on the first try. If it's a little
inaccessible at first, that comes with the territory--i.e., introducing
the player into a highly complex and well-developed world--and it's
hardly a fatal flaw. In its interactivity and in the quality of its
storytelling, Worlds Apart is a remarkable accomplishment.

Wormhole: The Beginning is the "introductory" game from
Neotext. According to its web page, it has been "discontinued." Well,
what can I say? It's a game that succeeds very well despite its
massive flaws. It's annoying and frustrating, hobbled by cliches and a
completely substandard parser. On the other hand the plot is so
compelling, so interesting, that I simply couldn't stop playing this
game.

It's the middle of the night. Your friend George Edfry, who lives in
Virginia, wakes you up with a phone call. The description of the phone
call, BTW, has got to be THE funniest moments in any game outside of
the Space Quest series. So you go to his house.

Morning. The game begins. You've left your keys in the ignition of
your Honda after locking your door and exiting the car. Excuse me, but
how the heck is that possible? Never mind, since that's the setup for
one of the game's most interesting puzzle. There are also George's car
and, for a sinister bit of foreshadowing, an unexplained Lincoln
parked outside of his house. You can interact with neither of these
cars in any way whatsoever. The author put in a brilliant surprise
when I looked under the welcome mat, and... I won't even dream of
telling you! You soon get to a puzzle where, to progress any further,
you have to deal with a hostile guard dog in exactly the same way that
you dealt with the poodle in <a href = "#wishbringer">Wishbringer</a>.

Well, that was the opening game. Soon you will be discovering the
fiendishly clever plot and brilliant surprises. It soon becomes
obvious that one of George's experiments have gone horribly
wrong. Food stains on carpets are replaced by blood as you
progress. You will discover a rift into another dimension. And,
eventually, you will find George himself in a state that came as a
complete surprise to me.

Fun, eh? Yep. but this game has serious flaws. There's a chimney that
you can enter, shades of <a href = "c.html#curses">Curses</a>, but you can't do anything in it!
There's a flashlight in the game that works the same whether it's
turned on or not. In short, the coding is awful. Nowhere is this more
evident than in a room with a pool of mercury in it. Try ENTER THE
POOL, GO IN THE POOL, JUMP IN THE POOL, and JUMP ON THE POOL -- three
of them give a "you can't do that" message. You cannot put anything in
the pool. You cannot put anything on the pool. You cannot look in it
or under it. You can't drink it. And, even though it's specifically
called a "reflection pool", it's utterly impossible to shine the
flashlight on it. Towards the end the game has your character say a
line (about moon-stones, for those who know) when he could not
possibly know what he's talking about. And the final puzzle, that of
finding the last moonstone, has got to be the most stupid and
illogical one I've ever played because it requires George to be a
moron almost beyond comprehension.

I'm looking forward to playing Neosoft's second game, Urban
Cleanup. Wormhole has promise. Perhaps Urban Cleanup will realize it.

From: Jimmy Maher &lt;maher SP@G grandecom.net&gt;
Review appeared in <a href = "backissues/spag41.html">SPAG #41</a> -- July 15, 2005

TITLE: Wumpus 2000
AUTHOR: Muffy St. Bernard
EMAIL: muffysb SP@G hotmail.com
DATE: November 2004
PARSER: Inform
SUPPORTS: Z-code ports
AVAILABILITY: Freeware, IF Archive

VERSION: Release 1

Wumpus 2000 is a rather bold amalgamation of everything the average
member of the IF community hates the most. We have hunger daemons,
randomized combat, and arbitrary death. Best of all, the whole game is a
gigantic five-level maze. Don't move on to the next review just yet,
though. There are some interesting things going on here.

As its name would imply, Wumpus 2000 is an homage to the early '70's IF
progenitor Hunt the Wumpus. However, Wumpus 2000 adds to Hunt the Wumpus
at least a suggestion of a plot and more interactive elements, thus
changing its form from an elaborate logical puzzle to a full-blown, if
rather unusual, text adventure. The player is a newspaper reporter whose
expose has angered the wrong people, resulting in her being deposited
into a monster-infested toxic waste dump below her city. The objective
is simple survival and, ultimately, escape. To do this, the player must
explore a 5-level, 100 room dungeon which is randomly generated for each
game, building up equipment and experience in preparation for her
showdown with the game's ultimate foe, the wumpus itself. In classic
dungeon crawl style, the monsters and challenges get steadily tougher as
one progresses, but the rewards -- in the form of more powerful weapons,
and treasures which can add to the player's score upon escape -- also
increase. You will also have the opportunity to get physically stronger
in a couple of different ways, a nice stand-in for the conventional RPG
experience level trope. Taking advantage of these opportunities is
essential if you are to have any hope of defeating the tougher monsters
on level 3 and below.

Yet the heart of Wumpus 2000 remains mapping. There has been
considerable discussion on the IF newsgroups about potential
alternatives to the traditional compass style of navigation. Wumpus 2000
is interesting in this regard, for it dispenses with directions
altogether. Rooms are numbered from 1 to 100, with rooms 1 through 20 on
level 1, 21 through 40 on level 2, etc. Exits from each room are listed
not with their direction but with their destination. For instance, the
exits from the first room of my game looked like this at the beginning:

Exit 1 corkscrews toward an unexplored room.
Exit 2 corkscrews toward an unexplored room. 
Exit 3 corkscrews toward an unexplored room.

After I had explored a bit, they looked like this:

Exit 1 corkscrews toward room 1 (A vast, rough chamber.)
Exit 2 corkscrews toward room 17 (A vast, rough chamber.)
Exit 3 corkscrews toward room 18 (A vast, rough chamber.)

Mapping this is not really that difficult, although it does require a
slightly different frame of mind. One must stop thinking directionally
and start thinking solely in terms of connections. Deeper in the
dungeon, things start to get a bit more complicated. You will encounter
steep slopes upon which you can lose your footing, rushing water which
can sweep you away in undesired directions, and other such obstacles.
Things get really tough in the bottom couple of levels, when you run
into things like this:

Exit 1 corkscrews toward a familiar part of this room.
Exit 2 corkscrews toward an unexplored part of this room. 
Exit 3 corkscrews toward a familiar part of this room.
Exit 4 rises steeply toward room 85 (A vast, dark chamber.)

As you can see, there are now multiple locations located in the "same"
room. Mapping this sort of thing requires some real ingenuity, as well
as resorting to the old standby of dropping items about the place and
hoping no wandering monsters carry them off. For the truly masochistic,
there is an option to turn off the room numbers altogether throughout
the dungeon. Needless to say, I didn't partake.

Other than exploring and mapping, you will spend your time collecting
and experimenting with a variety of useful and not so useful items,
fighting monsters, and slowly building up your character. There really
are no traditional set-piece puzzles. The game is completely simulation
oriented, with it challenges all arising organically from the
environment. I would say its gameplay has as much in common with Nethack
and its cousins as it does with traditional narrative IF.

Dungeons and Dragons tropes get pretty unbearable pretty quickly for me,
but the game's saving grace is that it never takes itself particularly
seriously. Monsters are silly and fun, and you will even find some very
humorous little notes left by the dungeon's earlier (doomed) explorers.

It isn't the sort of thing I usually enjoy, but I had quite a good time
with Wumpus 2000 for the first few hours. I found it fairly challenging,
but not ridiculously so like, say, Nethack, and figuring out how things
worked and reading the game's humorous little descriptions and asides
was a lot of fun. Eventually, though, things got simultaneously more
difficult and tedious, and I started to cheat, making copious use of the
UNDO command. The presence of UNDO destroys much of the challenge in a
game like this, for virtually any combat can now be won by UNDOING
anytime the result in a given turn is unfavorable to your character. I'm
frankly rather surprised that the author didn't disable it, although I'm
not disappointed. I seriously doubt I would have ever completed the game
without it.

Even with UNDO, winning the game for me involved some more extensive
cheating. I found myself on the last level of the dungeon, having killed
the dreaded wumpus, with two of the three keys I needed to make my final
escape. Naturally, I couldn't find the third. In the end, I hacked into
the object tree to find that last elusive key and win the game.
Sometimes a man must do what a man must do...

The prospective player should be aware that there are a few bugs to be
found. The worst of these is that doing an INVENTORY while holding the
gem pouch you find on one of the later levels will crash the game with
an illegal opcode. Perhaps another release will be forthcoming to
correct this issue, and a few other more minor niggles.

For me, the problem with a game like this is that increased challenge
just feels like increased tedium. At some point it all becomes work
rather than fun, and then I either give up or cheat. I suspect that many
other IF players are, like me, looking for something fundamentally
different in their computer entertainment than that which Wumpus 2000
provides, and so I am not surprised that there has been virtually no
discussion of this game in the community since its release. Still, if
you think you might enjoy a heaping dose of RPG-style simulation and
old-school mapping puzzles to go with a little bit of narrative, give
Wumpus 2000 a try. It really does do what it does very well, and I don't
know of any other modern parser-based game quite like it.
