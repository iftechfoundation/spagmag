# SPAG Magazine web site repository

- Web site: https://spagmag.org/

This repository holds the files and scripts I used in updating the SPAG files for their new web host.

This repo will probably not be used again, unless I have reason to change the site format or page footer. I'm just stashing it on Github because it's easy to do.
